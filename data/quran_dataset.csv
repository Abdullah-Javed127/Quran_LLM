"ALL PRAISE BE to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,",1,1,ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"All praise belongs to Allah with regards to His essence, attributes and actions, because He is the Creator of everything. Everything belongs to Him and He is the disposer of their affairs; blessing individuals specifically and humans in general."
"Most beneficent, ever-merciful,",2,1,ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,"Two names of Allah, Ar-Raḥmān and Ar-Raḥīm, derived from the word raḥmah, or mercy: indicating His mercy for creation, with the believers being the greatest recipients of it."
King of the Day of Judgement.,3,1,مَٰلِكِ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,"He is the Master of the day of Judgement, the day in which we will be brought back to life and repaid for what we have done, all of His creation will be held accountable for their actions and recompensed for them. On that day God will ask “To whom belongs the Kingdom today?” [Sūrah Ghafir: 16] No one, no matter how high his status, will answer, and then God will reply Himself, “to God, the One, the Overcomer” [Sūrah Ghafir: 16]"
"You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help.",4,1,إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ,"We worship and obey none except You; we associate no one with You, and from You alone do we ask for help in all our affairs. All goodness is in Your hand, and there is no helper except You."
"Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight,",5,1,ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,"Show and facilitate for us the right way, the path of submission to You which has no crookedness, and make us firm upon it –"
"The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray.",6,1,صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ ٱلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,"The same path as those of Your creation whom You have blessed with guidance, such as the prophets, the truthful, martyrs, and the righteous ones. What good companions these people make! Keep us away from the path of those who earned Your anger, who knew the truth and did not follow it – as was the case with the Israelites; and keep us away from the path of those who lost their way and were not guided, because they were neglectful in seeking the Truth and being guided by it – as was the case with the Christians."
ALIF LAM MIM.,0,2,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓ,"Alif Lām Mīm – letters like these begin certain sūrahs of the Qur’ān. Although they have no meaning in themselves, they do however have a purpose. Since there is divine wisdom contained in everything in the Qur’ān, these letters point to the miracle of the Qur’ān, made up of the letters which make up the words we speak. Therefore, when sūrahs begin with letters in this way, they are usually followed with a verse about the Qur’ān, as we see in this sūrah."
"This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,",1,2,ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"This is the Qur’ān, in which there is nothing of any doubt, neither in terms of its origin, nor in terms of its meaning. It is the word of Allah, guiding those who are mindful of Allah to the way that leads to Him."
"Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;",2,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"They believe in the revelation that Allah sent down to you, O Prophet, and in that which He revealed to all the other prophets before you (peace be upon them), without distinction; and they have a definite belief in the Afterlife, with its rewards and punishments."
"Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter.",3,2,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,"They believe in the revelation that Allah sent down to you, O Prophet, and in that which He revealed to all the other prophets before you (peace be upon them), without distinction; and they have a definite belief in the Afterlife, with its rewards and punishments."
They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful.,4,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"The people who possess these qualities are on the path of guidance, and will be successful in this world and the next, gaining what they desire and being saved from what they fear."
"As for those who deny, it is all the same if you warn them or not, they will not believe.",5,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Those who reject what Allah revealed to His Messenger continue on the wrong path in their stubbornness. So, it makes no difference whether you warn them or not."
"God has sealed their hearts and ears, and veiled their eyes. For them is great deprivation.",6,2,خَتَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰٓ أَبْصَٰرِهِمْ غِشَٰوَةٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Allah has sealed their hearts, locking inside them their falsehood, and has placed a seal on their hearing, so that they do not listen to nor accept the truth. He has put a cover over their eyes, so that they do not see the truth in its clarity. They will suffer greatly. After describing the disbelievers, who are at fault inside and out, He describes the hypocrites, who appear good on the outside, but are not so inwardly:"
"And there are some who, though they say: ""We believe in God and the Last Day,"" (in reality) do not believe.",7,2,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Among people are some who claim to have faith in Allah, when they actually do not believe."
"They (try to) deceive God and those who believe, yet deceive none but themselves although they do not know.",8,2,يُخَٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"They think that they can deceive Allah and the believers by acting outside as if they believe, while inside hiding their disbelief; but really, they only deceive themselves, without realising it. Allah knows all that is secret and hidden, and has told the believers what these people are like."
"Sick are their hearts, and God adds to their malady. For them is suffering for they lie.",9,2,فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضًا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْذِبُونَ,"Allah increases the disease in their hearts, and they reap what they sow. Because they lied Allah increases the disease of doubts in their hearts, by adding hesitation to their uncertainty, hence they only gain what they deserve. They will have a painful suffering in the worst parts of Hell because they lied against Allah, and the people, and rejected the message brought by Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
"When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: ""Why, we are reformers.""",10,2,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ,"When they are told not to ruin things on earth – through their rejection of the truth, their disobedience and so on – they deny doing so, claiming that they only correct things and put them right."
"Yet they are surely mischief-mongers, even though they do not know.",11,2,أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَٰكِن لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ,"The truth is that it is they who ruin things, but they do not admit this, nor do they know that their actions are the cause of all ruin."
"When asked to believe as others do, they say: ""Should we believe like fools?"" And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know.",12,2,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ ءَامِنُوا۟ كَمَآ ءَامَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ قَالُوٓا۟ أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَآ ءَامَنَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ وَلَٰكِن لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ,"When they are told to have faith as the companions of Muhammad (peace be upon him) did, they reply, looking down on people and making fun of them, saying “should we have faith like simple-minded people do?” In fact, it is they who are the fools, but they are unaware of this."
"When they meet the faithful they say: ""We believe;"" but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: ""We are really with you; we were joking.""",13,2,وَإِذَا لَقُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ شَيَٰطِينِهِمْ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"When the hypocrites meet the believers, they say, ‘We believe what you believe’, as they think it will benefit them if they act like this; but when they are alone with their leaders, they say, ‘We are really with you and follow you. We are only making fun of them when we say that we believe’."
But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness.,14,2,ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِى طُغْيَٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"Allah mocks the hypocrites for their mocking of the believers, and He will repay in equal measure for their behavior. They are treated as believers in this world, but will be repaid for their lying and deception in the next life. He allows them to become more and more lost and to do more and more wrong, so they remain confused and doubtful about the truth."
"They are indeed those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from the deal, nor found the right way.",15,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَٰرَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ,"It is they who are the fools, because they exchanged faith for disbelief; and this exchange did not help them in any way, because they lost their faith in Allah and lost the way to the truth."
"They are like a man who kindles a fire, and when its glow has illumined the air God takes away their light leaving them in the dark where they will not be able to see.",16,2,مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُۥ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَٰتٍ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ,"They are like someone who lights a fire, but when it has lit up what is around him, Allah takes away the light from the flames: leaving them in the darkness, unable to see. Allah shows us what the hypocrites are like with two examples: one related to fire, and the other to water. In the example related to fire, He compares them to someone who lights a fire to illuminate things, but when it is lit and he thinks he will benefit from its light, it goes out, smoldering and leaving him in the dark. Such people then remain in the dark, unable to see anything or find a way."
"They are deaf, dumb and blind, and shall never return;",17,2,صُمٌّۢ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ,"They are deaf: unable to hear and accept the truth, or speak about it. They are blind to seeing the truth, so they do not turn back from their error."
"Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death. But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides.",18,2,أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَٰتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌۢ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"In the example related to water, a storm full of darkness, thunder and lightning is described. Some people are terrified by it and put their fingers in their ears because of the strength of the thunderclaps, scared of death. Allah surrounds the disbelievers, and has absolute power over them, so they cannot escape Him."
Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare. When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful.,19,2,يَكَادُ ٱلْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْا۟ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا۟ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"The brightness of the lightning almost blinds them. Whenever it flashes, lighting things up, they go forward and when there is no light they remain in darkness, unable to move. If God willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight, in His absolute power over all things; and not return it to them because they turn away from the truth. The rain in the storm could be likened to the Qur’ān, the thunderclap to its warnings, and the lightning to truths, appearing to them from time to time. The covering of their ears to the thunderclaps likened to their turning away from the truth, and not responding to it. The hypocrites are similar to the people in these examples because they receive no benefit from anything. In the example of the fire, all they receive is darkness and a smoldering fire. In the example of the storm-cloud, all they receive is fear and alarm because of the thunder and lightning. Similarly, the hypocrites see nothing in Islam except difficulty and harshness."
"So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him",20,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"O people, worship no one other than your Lord, because He created you and the people before you, so that you may save yourselves from suffering, by following His instructions and keeping away from what He has prohibited."
"Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow -- your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly.",21,2,ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ فِرَٰشًا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"It is He Who made the earth like a carpet spread out in front of you and it is He Who masterfully constructed the sky over you. Through His grace rain falls, producing different crops from the earth, as produce for you. Do not, then, consider others to be equal to Allah, when you know that He alone is worthy of being worshipped."
"If you are in doubt of what We have revealed to Our votary, then bring a Surah like this, and call any witness, apart from God, you like, if you are truthful.",22,2,وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا۟ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِۦ وَٱدْعُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Allah challenges those who have any doubt about the Qur’ān revealed to His servant, Muhammad (peace be upon him), to produce a chapter just like it, and to call their helpers, if they are truthful about what they say."
"But if you cannot, as indeed you cannot, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, which has been prepared for the infidels.",23,2,فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا۟ وَلَن تَفْعَلُوا۟ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِى وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"If they are unable to do so – and they will never be able to do it – they should be mindful of the fire of Hell, which burns with people who deserve the torment, and with the idols which they used to worship instead of Allah: punishing both the idol-worshipers and what they worshiped. The fire of Hell has been prepared as a punishment for the disbelievers."
"Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow, and where, when they eat the fruits that grow, they will say: ""Indeed they are the same as we were given before,"" so like in semblance the food would be. And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly.",24,2,وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا۟ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقًا قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُوا۟ بِهِۦ مُتَشَٰبِهًا وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"The warnings in the previous verses were for the disbelievers, so now the Messenger is told to address the believers: Give good news to those who have faith in Allah and do good, and tell them about that which will please them: gardens in Paradise, with rivers flowing beneath their palaces and trees. Whenever they are given fruits from the gardens to consume, they will comment on how similar they are to the fruits of the earth, saying, ‘This is similar to what we had before’. They will be given fruits that carry the same name and shape, so that they may recognise and desire them, but they will in fact taste differently. In the Garden they will be paired with their mates, who will not have any unpleasant traits that people have on earth; and they will live there in eternal bliss, unlike the bliss of the earth which is only temporary."
"God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: ""What does God mean by this parable?"" He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,",25,2,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْىِۦٓ أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا يُضِلُّ بِهِۦ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِى بِهِۦ كَثِيرًا وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِۦٓ إِلَّا ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Allah does not shy away from using whatever example He wishes, whether that be of a gnat or anything bigger than it. The believers know and trust that there is wisdom in the use of such examples, while the disbelievers will make fun, asking each other why Allah uses examples with lowly creatures, such as gnats, flies and spiders. Allah replies that in these examples lie guidance, direction and a test for people. There are many people who are misguided by Allah through these examples, because they refuse to consider them; and there are many who He guides along the right path because they learn from them. He does not misguide anyone except those who deserve to be misguided. They are those who do not obey Him."
"Who, having sealed it, break God's covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly.",26,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مِيثَٰقِهِۦ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦٓ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Those who break the promise they made with God to serve Him alone and follow His way. This is in the verse, “He made them testify concerning themselves: “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we bear witness!” (7:172) He affirmed this by sending the prophets and the scriptures. Those who do not take their promises with God seriously are those who cut off from things which God instructed not to, such as blood relations and they work to spread corruption on earth through their wrongdoing. They are the losers in this world and the next."
Then how can you disbelieve in God? He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return.,27,2,كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَٰتًا فَأَحْيَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Strange is the situation of the disbelievers. How can you disbelieve the Oneness of Allah when you can see the signs of His power in your own existence? You were nothing, and He brought you to life; then you will die, and you shall be brought to life again. Then you will return to Him and be held accountable."
"He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything.",28,2,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّىٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"It is Allah alone Who created everything on earth for you: the countless rivers, trees and so on, from which you benefit and enjoy. Then He turned to the sky, making it into seven heavens, and He has knowledge of everything."
"Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: ""I have to place a trustee on the earth,"" they said: ""Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?"" And God said: ""I know what you do not know.""",29,2,وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنِّى جَاعِلٌ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً قَالُوٓا۟ أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ ٱلدِّمَآءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ قَالَ إِنِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah tells His Prophet and humankind that He said to the angels that He would put humans on earth who will give birth to other humans, to inhabit it according to His laws. The angels asked their Lord, trying to understand, what the wisdom behind making the children of Adam guardians of the earth was, when they would ruin things in it, and kill in it, while the angels always do as He tells them, and recognise His greatness, praising Him and honouring His power and perfection. Allah replied to their question, saying that He knew the deep wisdom behind His creation of them, and behind making them guardians, and the angels did not."
"Then He gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: ""Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.""",30,2,وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنۢبِـُٔونِى بِأَسْمَآءِ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"To reveal the position of Adam, Allah taught him the names of everything, living things and objects, their pronunciation and meanings. Then he put them before the angels, instructing them to tell Him the names if they were telling the truth when they said that they were a nobler and better creation than Adam."
"And they said: ""Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise.""",31,2,قَالُوا۟ سُبْحَٰنَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Recognising their shortcomings and that everything comes from Allah, they said that they acknowledged that His judgement and sacred law could not be doubted, and that they had no knowledge except for the knowledge He had given them, accepting that He is the Knowing, from Whom nothing is hidden, and the Wise in His decrees and laws."
"Then He said to Adam: ""Convey to them their names."" And when he had told them, God said: ""Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?""",32,2,قَالَ يَٰٓـَٔادَمُ أَنۢبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ فَلَمَّآ أَنۢبَأَهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ إِنِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,"Then Allah told Adam to tell them the names. When Adam told the angels the names of things, as he had been taught, Allah reminded the angels that He had told them that He knew everything hidden in the heavens and the earth, and what they made public and what they said inside of themselves."
"Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever.",33,2,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِءَادَمَ فَسَجَدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Allah reveals that He told the angels to prostrate to Adam out of recognition and respect, so they prostrated to him, eager to do as He told them, except for Iblīs, or Satan, who was originally from the jinn. Due to the excellence of his worship, Allah had entered Iblīs into the company of the angels; but he then returned to his lowly nature, refusing to prostrate as Allah told him to, and becoming proud towards Adam, leading to him becoming a disbeliever."
"And We said to Adam: ""Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors.",34,2,وَقُلْنَا يَٰٓـَٔادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Allah told Adam to live with his wife, Eve, in the Garden, with nothing to ruin their bliss. They were instructed to consume the delightful food from anywhere in the Garden, but also to avoid going near a particular tree which they were forbidden to eat from. If they ate from the prohibited tree, they would become wrongdoers for disobeying Him."
"But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the (happy) state they were in. And We said: ""Go, one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.""",35,2,فَأَزَلَّهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ وَقُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُوا۟ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Satan did not stop whispering to them, trying to trick them, until he made them slip and fall by eating from the tree which Allah had told them not to. For this Allah sent them out of the Garden, telling them and Satan to go down to the earth, some of them enemies to others, where they would stay and live, enjoying the good things there until their lifespan, and until the Final Hour arrived."
Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him: Indeed He is compassionate and kind.,36,2,فَتَلَقَّىٰٓ ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِۦ كَلِمَٰتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Adam received the words given to him by Allah, and was inspired to ask for forgiveness with them. These words of forgiveness are mentioned in Sūrah Al-A‘rāf: 23: ‘They said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be of the losers”’. Allah accepted Adam’s turning to Him and forgave him, for He is always forgiving and Merciful towards His creation."
"And We said to them: ""Go, all of you. When I send guidance, whoever follows it will neither have fear nor regret;",37,2,قُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُوا۟ مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّى هُدًى فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَاىَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Allah told them to go down together from the Garden to the earth, and said that when He sends guidance, through the prophets, those who follow it and have faith in His prophets will have nothing to fear in the world to come, and will not feel sorrow about what passed them by on earth."
"But those who deny and reject Our signs will belong to Hell, and there abide unchanged.""",38,2,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"As for those who disbelieve and deny His signs, they are the people of the fire of Hell, who will live there eternally."
"O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you. So keep your pledge to Me, and I will mine to you, and be fearful of Me,",39,2,يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتِىَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا۟ بِعَهْدِىٓ أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّٰىَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,"O Children of the Prophet Jacob, remember the many blessings He gave you and be thankful for them. Fulfil your contract to Him, having faith in Him, His prophets and His sacred laws. If you fulfil your contract, He will fulfil His contract to you, as well as His promises to you of a good life on earth and a beautiful reward on the Day of Judgement. Fear Him alone and do not break His contract."
"And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it, nor part with it for little gain; and beware of Me.",40,2,وَءَامِنُوا۟ بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوٓا۟ أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍۭ بِهِۦ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِى ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَإِيَّٰىَ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"Also, have faith in the Qur’ān which Allah revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) confirming what came in the Torah, before its corruption, concerning the Oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), and do not be the first group to disbelieve. Do not exchange His signs – the verses which He has revealed – for the small price of position or leadership, and avoid His displeasure and punishment."
"Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.",41,2,وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا۟ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا۟ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Do not hide the truth, which He revealed to His prophets, with lies and falsehood; and do not hide the truth of the description of Muhammad which came in His scripture, when you know what the truth is and are convinced of it."
"Be firm in devotion; give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others), and bow with those who bow (before God).",42,2,وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱرْكَعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ,"Establish the prayers properly with its obligatory and recommended parts; give Zakat from your wealth, which Allah has put in your hands; and be humble to Allah with those who are humble of Muhammad’s nation (peace be upon him)."
"Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves? You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?",43,2,أَتَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَتَنسَوْنَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"What is more immoral than telling others to have faith and do good when you, upon reading the Torah, turn away from it and forget it yourselves, while knowing that it orders you to follow Allah’s religion and have faith in His prophets? Have you then no sense?"
"Find strength in fortitude and prayer, which is heavy and exacting but for those who are humble and meek,",44,2,وَٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ,"Ask for help in sacred and worldly affairs, with patience and prayer, which bring you close to Allah and allow you to reach Him, so that He will help you, protect you and take away your difficulties. Prayer is a hardship except for those who are humble to their Lord."
"Who are conscious that they have to meet their Lord, and to Him they have to return.",45,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُوا۟ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ,"The humble are convinced that they will meet their Lord on the Day of Judgement, that they are returning to Him and will be held accountable for their actions."
"Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.",46,2,يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتِىَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّى فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Israelites, remember the sacred and worldly blessings which I gave to you, and that I favoured you over all those of your time in terms of prophethood and power."
"Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them.",47,2,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ يَوْمًا لَّا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"Protect yourselves against the Day of Judgement by following Allah’s instructions and staying away from what He has prohibited. On that day no soul will be able to help another in any way, and no pleading on their behalf will be accepted to benefit them or protect them from harm, except with Allah’s permission, and no ransom will be taken, even if it were to be the earth filled with gold. They will have no helpers on that day. Without appeal, ransom or helper, to where will they turn?"
"Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh's people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord.",48,2,وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,"O Israelites! Remember when Allah saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were tormenting you, slaughtering your sons so you would not survive, and letting your women live so they could serve them, taking great pains to humiliate and insult you. When you were saved from the oppression of Pharaoh and his people, it was a great test for you from your Lord, to see if you would be thankful."
"Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes.",49,2,وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَنجَيْنَٰكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَآ ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,"Remember Allah’s favour in saving you when He parted the sea and made it a dry path for you to go through, while drowning your enemies, Pharaoh and his followers, before your very eyes, as you looked on."
"Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong.",50,2,وَإِذْ وَٰعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰٓ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَأَنتُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"Also, remember that the forty nights appointed to Moses were from the blessings of Allah, in which the revelation of the Torah, with its light and guidance, was completed. Yet you went and worshipped the calf during that period, which made you into wrongdoers."
"Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful.",51,2,ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Then Allah forgave you when you asked for forgiveness, and did not take you to account for it, so that you might be thankful to Him, worshipping Him in the best way and doing as He instructed."
"Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided.",52,2,وَإِذْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Also, remember that Allah’s giving Moses (peace be upon him) the Torah as a criterion between truth and falsehood, discriminating between guidance and misguidance, so that you might be guided to the truth through it, were from the blessings of Allah."
"Remember, Moses said: ""My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord."" And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful.",53,2,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِۦ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنفُسَكُم بِٱتِّخَاذِكُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ عِندَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Also, remember that Allah’s allowing you to ask His forgiveness for worshipping the calf, when Moses (peace be upon him) told you that you had wronged yourselves by taking the calf as a god and worshipping it, were from the blessings of Allah. Moses told you to ask for forgiveness and repent to your Creator by some of you killing others, because turning to Him in this way was better for you than persisting in disbelief, which would lead to an eternity in the fire of Hell. So, you did this with Allah’s approval, and He forgave you, for He is Forgiving and Merciful with His servants."
"Remember, when you said to Moses: ""We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face,"" lightning struck you as you looked.",54,2,وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,"Also, remember when you shamelessly addressed Moses (peace be upon him), saying that you would not believe him until you saw Allah with your own eyes, in the open before you, and the lightning struck you and killed you, whilst some of you looked at the others."
Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;,55,2,ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَٰكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Then He brought you back to life after death so that you might be thankful to Him for the blessings He granted you in this way.
"And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves.",56,2,وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْغَمَامَ وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٰكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Another of Allah’s blessings was that He sent clouds to shade you from the heat of the sun when you were wandering the earth; and He sent down manna, a sweet drink similar to honey, and quails for you, telling you to consume of the good things He had provided you with. Their ingratitude and disbelief for these blessings did not affect Allah in any way, but they wronged themselves, losing their share from the good they had done and exposing themselves to suffering."
"And remember, We said to you: ""Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: 'May our sins be forgiven.' We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance.",57,2,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ٱدْخُلُوا۟ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُوا۟ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَدًا وَٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُولُوا۟ حِطَّةٌ نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَٰيَٰكُمْ وَسَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Remember, from Allah’s blessings upon you, when He told you to enter Jerusalem and abundantly consume, with ease, from the good things in it from any place you wanted. He told you to prostrate in humility to Him when you entered, asking Him to remove your sins, so that He might answer you, and increase those who do good actions, rewarding them in this way."
"But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed.",58,2,فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ قَوْلًا غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ رِجْزًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْسُقُونَ,"The wrongdoers among them changed what they were told to do and say, and entered dragging themselves on their rears, saying, ‘A grain in a hair’, mocking Allah’s sacred law. Due to their actions He sent down a torment from the sky upon the wrongdoers among them, because they trespassed over the limits of the law and disobeyed His command."
"And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking. Eat and drink, (enjoy) God's gifts, and spread no discord in the land.",59,2,وَإِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِۦ فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ كُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ مِن رِّزْقِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"Remember, from Allah’s blessings upon you, when you were in the wilderness, and you suffered great thirst, so Moses prayed to his Lord and asked that He give you water. Allah commanded that he hit the rock with his stick, and when he hit it, twelve springs appeared from it, the same number as the number of your tribes. Water gushed from them, and Allah made clear to each tribe which was their spring to drink from, so that there would be no conflict between you. And He told you to eat and drink from what He provided for you, without any effort or work from you, and told you not to put your efforts into ruining things on earth."
"Remember, when you said: ""O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;"" he said: ""Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask."" So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled.",60,2,وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَٰحِدٍ فَٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنۢبِتُ ٱلْأَرْضُ مِنۢ بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ ٱلَّذِى هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِٱلَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ ٱهْبِطُوا۟ مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ وَٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ يَكْفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا۟ وَّكَانُوا۟ يَعْتَدُونَ,"Also, remember when you were ungrateful for the blessings of your Lord, and became tired of the manna and quails He sent down to you, and said that you would not put up with one type of food. So, you asked Moses (peace be upon him) to ask Allah to produce herbs, vegetables, cucumbers, grains, lentils and onions from the plants on earth for you to consume. Moses said, disapproving of your request, that you wanted to exchange manna and quails which were better and nobler and came to you without effort or work, for what was lesser and worse. You were told to go down from this land to any town, and that you would find what you had asked for in its fields and markets. Due to following whims and repeatedly turning away from what Allah chose for them, they were disgraced, given poverty and misery. They earned Allah’s anger, because they turned away from His religion, and disbelieved His signs, and unjustly and brutally killed His prophets – all because they rebelled against Allah and used to transgress His limits."
"Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret.",61,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ وَٱلصَّٰبِـِٔينَ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Those who have faith from the nation of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and from the communities who came before him – from the Jews, the Christians and Sabians (said to be a group who followed prophets who were of the faith of Abraham, peace be upon him) – will have their reward with their Lord. They will not fear what awaits them in the Afterlife, nor grieve over what happened to them on earth. This was the case before the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent. Now his message of Islam – devotion and dedication to Allah – is the only way of life accepted by Allah, as He said, ‘Whoever seeks a path other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him’ [ Sūrah Āl ͑Imrān: 85]."
"Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: ""Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed.""",62,2,وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُوا۟ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"Remember when Allah made a contract with you: that you should have faith in Allah and His prophets. He raised the mountain over you, inspiring awe and warning you against breaking the contract, commanding you to take what He had revealed to you of the Torah seriously and carefully, not taking it for granted or being lazy about it. He told you to remember and reflect upon it, so that you might be careful about what you earn from Allah."
"But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost.",63,2,ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ لَكُنتُم مِّنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Yet after making a firm promise, you broke the contract and rebelled. If it had not been for Allah’s favour in His tolerance towards you, and His mercy, accepting when you asked for forgiveness, then you would be among the losers because of your turning away and rebellion."
"You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: ""Become (like) apes despised,""",64,2,وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱعْتَدَوْا۟ مِنكُمْ فِى ٱلسَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا۟ قِرَدَةً خَٰسِـِٔينَ,"You know well the story of your ancestors, who prepared to fish on the Sabbath when they were not allowed to do so, and did so through trickery. They set up nets in preparation for the Sabbath so Allah made them into monkeys, rejected and cast out, because of their trickery."
"And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God.",65,2,فَجَعَلْنَٰهَا نَكَٰلًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Allah made this village, which had transgressed the limits, an example to the surrounding villages, and an example to those who came after it, so that they would not do the same and deserve the same fate. He made it a reminder for those mindful of Allah, who are careful of facing the consequences of their actions in the life to come, and are mindful of Allah’s repayment for those who transgress the limits."
"Remember, when Moses said to his people: ""God demands that you sacrifice a cow,"" they said: ""Are you making fun of us?"" And he said: ""God forbid that I be of the ignorant.""",66,2,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تَذْبَحُوا۟ بَقَرَةً قَالُوٓا۟ أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُوًا قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِٱللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"From the stories of your ancestors, remember what happened between them and Moses (peace be upon him) when he told them that Allah had instructed them to slaughter a cow. Instead of hurrying to do so, they said, stubbornly, ‘Are you making fun of us?’ Moses replied that he asked for Allah’s protection from being one of the ignorant people, who lied about Allah, and made fun of other people."
"""Call on your Lord for us,"" they said, ""that He might inform us what kind she should be."" ""Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between,"" answered Moses. ""So do as you are bid.""",67,2,قَالُوا۟ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِىَ قَالَ إِنَّهُۥ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَّا فَارِضٌ وَلَا بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌۢ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ فَٱفْعَلُوا۟ مَا تُؤْمَرُونَ,"They asked Moses to call on his Lord to clarify what the cow they had been told to sacrifice was like. Moses told them that Allah said that it was neither old nor young, but was between the two; and he told them to do what Allah had instructed them to."
"""Call on your Lord,"" they said, ""to tell us the colour of the cow."" ""God says,"" answered Moses, ""a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye.""",68,2,قَالُوا۟ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُۥ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَآءُ فَاقِعٌ لَّوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ ٱلنَّٰظِرِينَ,"They continued debating and being stubborn, telling Moses (peace be upon him) to call on his Lord to make clear to them the colour of the cow. Moses told them that Allah said that it was a yellow cow, with a very strong colour, which was pleasing to everyone who saw it."
"""Call on your Lord,"" they said, ""to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us. If God wills we shall be guided aright.""",69,2,قَالُوا۟ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِىَ إِنَّ ٱلْبَقَرَ تَشَٰبَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ,"They continued in their stubbornness, telling Moses to ask Allah to further clarify the nature of the cow. They said that there were many cows fitting the description, and they could not therefore identify it, insisting that they would then, if Allah willed, be guided to the right cow for sacrifice."
"And Moses said: ""He says it's a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish."" ""Now have you brought us the truth,"" they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow.",70,2,قَالَ إِنَّهُۥ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَّا ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَلَا تَسْقِى ٱلْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لَّا شِيَةَ فِيهَا قَالُوا۟ ٱلْـَٰٔنَ جِئْتَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُوا۟ يَفْعَلُونَ,"Then Moses told them that Allah said the cow was not used for ploughing or irrigating the earth; she had no faults, and no marks of a different colour other than her yellow. They then replied that now he had brought them a detailed description, correctly identifying the cow. They sacrificed it, after almost not having done it, due to all their arguing and stubbornness."
"Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed.",71,2,وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْسًا فَٱدَّٰرَْٰٔتُمْ فِيهَا وَٱللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,"Allah reminds the Israelites about when they killed one of their own. They accused each other of it, each rejecting the accusation of having killed him, and accusing someone else, until they fought. But Allah revealed what they were hiding about the murder of the innocent person."
"We had pronounced already: ""Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life)."" Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand.",72,2,فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا كَذَٰلِكَ يُحْىِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah told them to hit the murdered man with a piece of the cow which they had been told to sacrifice. He would then bring him to life to tell them who the murderer was. They did this and he told them who had killed him. As this man was brought back to life by Allah, so will He bring the dead back to life on the Day of Judgement. Allah gives humanity clear signs of His power, to make them reflect and understand, and have true faith in Him."
"Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God. And God is not negligent of all that you do.",73,2,ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَهِىَ كَٱلْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً وَإِنَّ مِنَ ٱلْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Their hearts became hard after these great lessons and incredible miracles, until they became like rocks, and even harder than rocks, because they never changed, whereas rocks change and transform. Rivers spring from some rocks, and some split, and water comes out of them, gushing and flowing on the earth, benefitting people and animals. And some rocks fall from the heights of the mountains in awe of Allah. But their hearts were not like that. Allah is not unaware of anything we do, but knows everything, and will hold us to account for it."
"How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?",74,2,أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوا۟ لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَٰمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"O believers, do not expect, after knowing their true nature and how stubborn they are, that they will be truthful and respond to you. A group of their scholars heard the word of Allah, revealed to them in the Torah, and then changed its words and meanings after they had understood what it really meant; and they did this fully aware of the seriousness of the crime."
"For when they meet the faithful, they say: ""We believe;"" but when among themselves, they say: ""Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord. Have you no sense indeed?""",75,2,وَإِذَا لَقُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوٓا۟ أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُم بِمَا فَتَحَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَآجُّوكُم بِهِۦ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"An instance of their inconsistencies and deviousness occurred when some of them met some believers and acknowledged the truth of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the correctness of his message, as the Torah witnessed to it. But when they were alone with one another they blamed each other because of these acknowledgments, saying that the Muslims might use them as proof that they recognised the truth of Muhammad’s prophethood."
Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?,76,2,أَوَلَا يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,"They behave in this pathetic manner as if they are unaware that Allah knows what they hide, in terms of what they say and do, and what they reveal; but He will reveal it and expose them."
"Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies.",77,2,وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ إِلَّآ أَمَانِىَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ,"A group of them do not know how to read or write and do not know what is in the Torah or what it says. They have only lies which they heard from some of their leaders, and think it is the Torah revealed by Allah."
"But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: ""This is from God,"" so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!",78,2,فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا۟ بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ,"Misery and great suffering awaits those who write the scripture with their own hands, and then say, falsely, that it comes from Allah, exchanging the truth and guidance for a small gain in this world, such as money or leadership. They will experience misery and suffering because of what their hands have written, through which they told lies about Allah, and for whatever wealth or leadership they may gain through these lies."
"Yet they say: ""The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days."" Say.. ""Have you so received a promise from God?"" ""Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?""",79,2,وَقَالُوا۟ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلَّآ أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَةً قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَهْدًا فَلَن يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ عَهْدَهُۥٓ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"They say, falsely, that the fire of Hell will not touch them and they will not be in it except for a few days. Ask them, O Muhammad, if they have had a promise from Allah that this will be the case: if they have had a promise, then Allah will not break His contract; or ask them if they are saying about Allah what they do not know."
"Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever.",80,2,بَلَىٰ مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَٰطَتْ بِهِۦ خَطِيٓـَٔتُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"It is not as they imagine. Allah repays those who reach the evil of disbelief, and whose disobedience dominates them, with suffering in the fire of Hell, where they will live eternally."
"But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever.",81,2,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"So those who have faith in Allah and His Prophet, and do good, will be rewarded with entry into the Garden, where they will live eternally."
"Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: ""Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others),"" you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed.",82,2,وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ لَا تَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَقُولُوا۟ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنكُمْ وَأَنتُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"Remember the promise made between Allah and the Israelites: to worship Him alone; to be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the poor; to say good words to people, telling them to do what is right and not what is wrong, without harshness or severity; to perform the prayer as instructed; and to give Zakat to those who have a right to it. But all they did after making this promise was to turn away, rejecting the promise they had made."
"And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too.",83,2,وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَكُمْ لَا تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَآءَكُمْ وَلَا تُخْرِجُونَ أَنفُسَكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,"Remember the contract Allah made with you in the Torah: forbidding you from killing each other and forcing people to leave their homes. You admitted the contract, and you witnessed its validity."
"But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do.",84,2,ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِّنكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِهِمْ تَظَٰهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَإِن يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَٰرَىٰ تُفَٰدُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ فَمَا جَزَآءُ مَن يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْىٌ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَشَدِّ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Then you broke the contract: some of you killing others, and forcing a group of them to leave their homes, assisted by their enemies, unjustly and with aggression. Then if prisoners came to you in the hands of enemies, you pay their ransom and rescue them from their captivity, even though making them leave their homes was forbidden to you. How is it that you believe in some of what is in the Torah about the ransom of captives, and reject some of it (about not killing each other and driving people from where they live)? For those of you who do that, there is only humiliation in this life and the most severe torment in the Afterlife. Allah knows what you do; in fact, He is fully aware, and He will hold you to account."
They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them.,85,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"They are the people who exchange the Afterlife for this life, preferring what is temporary to what is eternal. Their suffering will not be lightened, and they will have no one to help them."
"Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace. Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew.",86,2,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ بِٱلرُّسُلِ وَءَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَأَيَّدْنَٰهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌۢ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰٓ أَنفُسُكُمُ ٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ,"Allah gave Moses the Torah, and followed him with other messengers. He gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs of the truth of what he came with, such as bringing the dead back to life and healing the blind and the lepers, and He strengthened him with the angel Gabriel, the Holy Spirit (peace be upon him). Yet is it, O Israelites, that whenever a messenger comes to you from Allah with what does not agree with your whims, you become full of pride towards the truth, looking down on the messengers of Allah? Do you reject a group of them and kill a group of them?"
"And they say: ""Our hearts are enfolded in covers."" In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe.",87,2,وَقَالُوا۟ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌۢ بَل لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلًا مَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The Israelites argued that their stubbornness was because their hearts were wrapped in a cover, so that none of what was said to them could reach them, or make sense to them. On the contrary, Allah deprived them of His mercy due to their disbelief, so that they will not have faith."
"And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it. The curse of God be on those who deny!",88,2,وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ كِتَٰبٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم مَّا عَرَفُوا۟ كَفَرُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَلَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The Qur’ān came to them from Allah, agreeing with the universal true principles of the Torah and the Gospel. Before it was revealed, they used to say that they would be helped against the idolaters, who worship others alongside Allah, and would have success over them when a prophet was sent, since they would have faith in him and follow him. But when the Qur’ān and Muhammad (peace be upon him) came to them, according to the description they recognised and the truth they knew, they disbelieved him. Allah curses those who disbelieve Him and His Prophet."
"They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath. The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious.",89,2,بِئْسَمَا ٱشْتَرَوْا۟ بِهِۦٓ أَنفُسَهُمْ أَن يَكْفُرُوا۟ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بَغْيًا أَن يُنَزِّلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ فَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ وَلِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"How miserable is what they accepted in exchange for their portion of faith in Allah and His messengers. They disbelieved what Allah revealed, and unjustly and enviously rejected His prophets, because He gave prophethood and the Qur’ān to Muhammad (peace be upon him). For disbelieving in Muhammad (peace be upon him) and for distorting the Torah beforehand, they deserved anger upon anger from Allah. A humiliating torment on the Day of Judgement will meet those who disbelieved in the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
"And when it is said to them: ""believe in what God has sent down,"" they say: ""We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter,"" although it affirms the truth they possess already. Say: ""Why have you then been slaying God's apostles as of old, if you do believe?""",90,2,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوا۟ نُؤْمِنُ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَآءَهُۥ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنۢبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"When this group of Jews was told to have faith in the truth and guidance that Allah revealed to His Prophet, they said that they believed in what had been revealed to their prophets, and denied anything besides this, and in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), although the Qur’ān is the truth, confirming what Allah had already revealed to them. Had they truly believed in what had been revealed to them, they would have believed in the Qur’ān. So, ask them then, O Muhammad, why they killed the prophets of Allah before, if they really had faith in the truth they brought to them."
"Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed.",91,2,وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكُم مُّوسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَأَنتُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"And also, your prophet Moses (peace be upon him), brought clear signs to you, proving that what he said was true. But after that you made the calf into a god and worshipped it, when Moses had gone to meet his Lord. You were wrongdoers for worshipping others alongside Allah, since only He is worthy of worship."
"Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) ""Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed,"" you said: ""We have heard and will not obey."" (The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief. Say: ""Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!""",92,2,وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُوا۟ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱسْمَعُوا۟ قَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُوا۟ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُم بِهِۦٓ إِيمَٰنُكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Remember when you made a binding promise with God to follow Moses, peace be upon him, and to accept what he brought from God. God raised the mountain over you so that you were awestruck, and told you to hold tightly and seriously to the scripture He had sent you, and to listen and follow what was revealed to you, if not God would make the mountain fall upon you, you said that you heard with your ears and rebelled in your actions. The worship of the calf took hold of their hearts because of their denial and ingratitude. O Muhammad, what their faith commands them to do is evil: disbelieving and turning away from what Allah instructs them to do – if they have any faith at all – because if they truly had faith they would not disbelieve and turn away from it."
"Tell them: ""If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true.""",93,2,قُلْ إِن كَانَتْ لَكُمُ ٱلدَّارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا۟ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Say, O Prophet: Jews, if Paradise in the Afterlife is just for you, and no other people will enter it, then wish for death, and ask for it, so that you reach this place quickly, and can rest from the burdens and worries of the life of this world, if you are truthful about what you claim."
But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well.,94,2,وَلَن يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًۢا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"They will never wish for death, because of what they have done in their lives: disbelieving in Allah, rejecting His prophets and distorting His scriptures. Allah knows the wrongdoers among them and other people: each person will be given what they have earned."
"You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry. Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do.",95,2,وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَوٰةٍ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ أَن يُعَمَّرَ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,"You will find, O Prophet, that the Jews are the most desirous for life, even if it is miserable and lowly. They are even greedier for it than the idolaters, who worship others alongside Allah, who do not believe in being brought back to life after death or in being held to account for what they have done. Despite being People of the Scripture, and believing in the resurrection and the reckoning, they would love to live a thousand years. Yet however long a life they might be given, it would not distance them from Allah’s punishment. Allah sees all that they do. Nothing is hidden from Him, and they will be given what they earn."
"Say: ""Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --",96,2,قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُۥ نَزَّلَهُۥ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Say, O Muhammad, to those of the Jews who say that Gabriel is their enemy among the angels, that whoever is against Gabriel – who revealed the Qur’ān to your heart, with Allah’s permission, affirming the sacred scripture that came before it, such as the Torah and the Gospel, showing the way to what is good, and bringing the good news to the believers of the bliss Allah has prepared for them – then he is misguided."
"Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers.""",97,2,مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّلَّهِ وَمَلَٰٓئِكَتِهِۦ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَىٰلَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Whoever stands against Allah, His angels and His prophets, and against His two angels Gabriel and Michael, then certainly Allah is a rival to the disbelievers from among you, and from other than you. Certain defeat faces whoever has Allah as his rival."
"We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth.",98,2,وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَآ إِلَّا ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"I have revealed to you, O Prophet, clear signs proving the truth of your prophethood and revelation. The only people who reject these signs, despite its clarity, are those who have abandoned Allah’s path."
"And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe.",99,2,أَوَكُلَّمَا عَٰهَدُوا۟ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُۥ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Due to their corrupt state, a group of the Jews would always break any commitment that they made, including the duty to have faith in what the Torah revealed about the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). Most of them do not really have faith in what Allah revealed, because faith leads to keeping to and honouring commitments and promises."
"When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it.",100,2,وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"When Muhammad (peace be upon him) came to them as a prophet from Allah, and he fitted the Torah’s description of him, a group of them turned away from the scripture that showed this, throwing it behind their backs, unmindful of it, not benefitting from its truth or guidance, like fools."
"And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: ""We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith)."" They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife. Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God. And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain. They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!",101,2,وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَا تَتْلُوا۟ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَٰنَ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَٰنُ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَٰرُوتَ وَمَٰرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَآ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِۦ بَيْنَ ٱلْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِۦ وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِۦ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا۟ لَمَنِ ٱشْتَرَىٰهُ مَا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَٰقٍ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا۟ بِهِۦٓ أَنفُسَهُمْ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"When they left the path of Allah, they followed instead what the satans said: lying about the kingdom of the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) by claiming that it was established through black magic. Solomon did not disbelieve by practicing black magic, as the Jews claimed; but the satans were disbelievers when they taught people the black magic revealed to the two angels, Hārūt and Mārūt, in the city of Babel in Iraq. These two angels would only teach black magic to someone after explaining that they were simply a trial and a test for people, warning them not to be ungrateful to Allah by learning it. Those who learned black magic from them but did not listen to their advice would, through it, separate a man and his wife by sowing hatred between them. These sorcerers are not able to harm anyone except with Allah’s permission and by His will. They learn what harms them and does not benefit them. This group of Jews knew that whoever exchanges the scripture of Allah for black magic will have no portion in the Afterlife. What an evil thing they sold their souls for when they exchanged the revelation and sacred law of Allah for black magic! If they had known what would benefit them, they would not have done something so disgraceful and clearly misguided."
"Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!",102,2,وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱتَّقَوْا۟ لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"If the Jews had really had faith in Allah, and been mindful to obey His sacred law and not rebel, His reward would have been far better for them, if they only knew."
"Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: ""Have regard for us (ra'ina),"" but ""look at us (unzurna),"" and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers.",103,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَقُولُوا۟ رَٰعِنَا وَقُولُوا۟ ٱنظُرْنَا وَٱسْمَعُوا۟ وَلِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Allah directs the believers to choose their words carefully, telling them not to say ‘rā‘inā’, meaning ‘look after us’ or ‘shepherd us’, when addressing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), because some of the Jews would mock what they said, twisting the words when addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him) themselves, corrupting its meaning to mean ‘foolish’ or ‘evil’. So, Allah told them not to use these words in order to prevent such mockery. He instructed them to say ‘unẓurnā’ instead, meaning ‘watch over us’, because the use of this word has no negative implications. Without doubt, the disbelievers in Allah will have a painful torment."
"Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite.",104,2,مَّا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَلَا ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"The disbelievers, whether they are from the People of the Scripture or from among the idolaters, do not like that Allah should send down any good thing, big or small, to you. Through His mercy Allah favours whom He wills of His servants with prophethood, revelation and faith. Allah’s bounty is vast. No one in creation gets any good except that it is from Him, and it is from His bounty that He sent His Prophet and revealed His scripture to us."
"When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things?",105,2,مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ ءَايَةٍ أَوْ نُنسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِّنْهَآ أَوْ مِثْلِهَآ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Allah makes it clear that whenever He removes the ruling of a verse or some words from the Qur’ān, so that people forget them, He replaces them with something more beneficial for the immediate moment or for later, or with what is similar. Such cases occur because of Allah’s wisdom and knowledge. You know, O Prophet, that Allah has power over all things. He does as He wills, and rules as He wishes."
"Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?",106,2,أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"You know, O Prophet, that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and that He rules as He wills. He instructs His servants as He wills, and forbids them from doing what He wills, establishing the sacred law as He wishes, and abolishing what He wishes. Your only protector is Allah, Who will take care of you, and you have no other helper to protect you from harm. Allah is the protector and guardian of all, and has power over everything."
"Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past? But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path.",107,2,أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَسْـَٔلُوا۟ رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَتَبَدَّلِ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلْإِيمَٰنِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"O believers, it is not right for you to question your Prophet, resisting and quarrelling with the revelation as the people of Moses questioned their prophet before, like when they said, ‘Show us Allah openly’ [ Sūrah Al-Nisā’: 153]. Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has lost the balanced way, the right path."
"How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them! But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things.",108,2,وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ إِيمَٰنِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِّنْ عِندِ أَنفُسِهِم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَٱعْفُوا۟ وَٱصْفَحُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِىَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to worshipping idols as you did before you came to have faith because of envy, when it has become clear to them that what the Prophet came with is the truth from God. Forgive them what they do, and pardon them for their ignorance and for whatever is not good in them, until the command of God comes regarding them. God’s command came with its ruling, either Islam, or paying the Jizya or physical intervention. God has power over all things, and they do not affect Him in any way."
"Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat. And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill.",109,2,وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا۟ لِأَنفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Establish the prayer with all its parts, both obligatory and recommended aspects, and give Zakat from their wealth to those who deserve it. Whatever good action they do in life before death will be a treasure for them: the reward of which they will find with their Lord on the Day of Judgement. Allah sees all that you do, and rewards everyone accordingly."
"And they say: ""None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;"" but this is only wishful thinking. Say: ""Bring the proof if you are truthful.""",110,2,وَقَالُوا۟ لَن يَدْخُلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَٰرَىٰ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"The Jews and the Christians each said that Paradise would be for them alone. These were just their vain wishes and imaginings. Tell them, O Prophet, in reply, to bring proof of what they were claiming if they were telling the truth."
"Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret.",111,2,بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُۥٓ أَجْرُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"All those who are sincere in repenting to Allah, doing good, serving Allah and following what the Prophet came with, will enter Paradise, no matter what group they come from. They will have their reward with their Lord. They will have no fear about what awaits them in the Afterlife, or feel sorrow about what passed them by in their lifetime. Regardless of someone’s original religious group – whether Jew, Christian, idolater other – successfully submitting to Allah is only now valid before Him by becoming Muslim, after the arrival of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
"The Jews say: ""The Christians are not right,"" and the Christians say: ""The Jews are in the wrong;"" yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too. God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning.",112,2,وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ ٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ وَقَالَتِ ٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ لَيْسَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"The Jews said that the Christians were not on the correct path and the Christians said the same about the Jews, although they both claimed to read the scriptures that Allah revealed to them, which contain the command to have faith in all the prophets without any distinction between them. In what they said, they are like those who know nothing, who worship others alongside Allah, rejecting all the prophets and the scriptures that were revealed to them. Allah will judge between those who disagree on the Day of Return. In His perfect and fair judgements, Allah tells His servants that there is no success without belief in all that He has revealed."
"And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence? For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come.",113,2,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن مَّنَعَ مَسَٰجِدَ ٱللَّهِ أَن يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُۥ وَسَعَىٰ فِى خَرَابِهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَآ إِلَّا خَآئِفِينَ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْىٌ وَلَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"No one does greater wrong than those who stop the name of Allah being said in His Houses of worship, preventing the prayer and remembrance of Allah and the recitation of the Qur’ān in them, trying to destroy and ruin them, through tearing them down or stopping people from worshipping in them. Those who try to destroy them should not enter Allah’s places of worship, except fearfully and with trembling hearts, after their disbelief and having stopped people worshipping in them. They will have shame and humiliation in their life on earth at the hands of the believers, and in the Afterlife is a great torment for having stopped people from Allah’s Houses of worship."
To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing.,114,2,وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّوا۟ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah has authority over the entire world, and He instructs His servants as He wills. Wherever you turn, you will find Allah: He surrounds His creation. Whether He instructs you to face Jerusalem or the Kaaba, or you make a mistake in the direction of prayer or are not sure of it, then it is not an issue, because to Allah belongs every direction. Allah is vast in His blessings; He covers His creation with His mercy and ease. He knows their intentions and everything that they do."
"Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God.",115,2,وَقَالُوا۟ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَدًا سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ بَل لَّهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُۥ قَٰنِتُونَ,"The Jews, the Christians and the idolaters, who worship others alongside Allah, said that Allah had taken a son. He is far above and beyond such a thing, because He has no need of His creation, and no one has a son unless he is needy; and to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. All created beings are His servants, in submission to Him, glory be to Him! They are His servants and He deals with them as He wills."
"Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: ""Be"", and it is.",116,2,بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰٓ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them; and there is nothing in creation that is like Him. If He decrees and wills something, He only says to it ‘Be’ and it is as He willed it. Nothing can stop His command and His decree."
"But those who are ignorant say: ""Why does God not speak or show us a sign?"" The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts. But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already.",117,2,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلَا يُكَلِّمُنَا ٱللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَآ ءَايَةٌ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ تَشَٰبَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,"Those without knowledge from among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters asked, in their stubbornness against the truth, why Allah did not speak to them directly, or why a miracle was not sent for them to see. Disbelieving communities said similar things to their prophets in the past: their hearts are all similar, because all disbelievers are the same, even if they are from different times and places. Allah makes His signs clear to those who are certain of the truth when it appears to them, not doubting or resisting it."
And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell.,118,2,إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا وَلَا تُسْـَٔلُ عَنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"The Prophet was sent with the religion of truth, in which there is no doubt: to bring the good news of Paradise to those who have faith, and to warn disbelievers about the fire of Hell. The Prophet only had to clearly deliver the message: Allah will not ask him about those people in the fire of Hell who did not believe in him."
"The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: ""God's guidance alone is true guidance;"" for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you.",119,2,وَلَن تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَلَا ٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم بَعْدَ ٱلَّذِى جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"Allah addresses and warns His Prophet, telling him that the Jews and the Christians will never be happy with him unless he leaves Islam and follows what they do; and that if he, or one of his followers, were to do such a thing, after the clear truth has come to them, they would not find protection or help from Allah. This makes clear the seriousness of leaving the truth and of following people of falsehood."
"Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers.",120,2,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَتْلُونَهُۥ حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"The Qur’ān mentions a group from the People of the Scripture who know the revealed texts they have been given and follow them properly. They find in these scriptures signs pointing to the truth of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him); and because of this they immediately have faith in him. Another group sticks to its disbelief, and for them is loss."
"O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.",121,2,يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتِىَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّى فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Israelites, remember the blessings, sacred and worldly, which I gave to you, and remember that I favoured you over those of your time with prophethood and authority."
"Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach.",122,2,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ يَوْمًا لَّا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا تَنفَعُهَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"Protect yourself from the torment of the Day of Return by following the instructions of Allah and keeping away from what He has prohibited, because on that day no soul will be able to help another soul in any way; no ransom will be accepted for it, no matter how great; and no one pleading on its behalf will benefit it, no matter how high their position. On that day, a soul will have no helper other than Allah."
"Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: ""I will make you a leader among men."" And when Abraham asked: ""From my progeny too?"" the Lord said: ""My pledge does not include transgressors.""",123,2,وَإِذِ ٱبْتَلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ رَبُّهُۥ بِكَلِمَٰتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِى قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"The Qur’ān tells us that Allah tested Abraham (peace be upon him) by instructing him to fulfil commandments and obligations. Abraham obeyed, fulfilling the orders completely. Allah told His prophet Abraham that He would make his manners and behaviour an example for people to follow. Abraham asked Allah to make also his descendants leaders who people would be guided by. Allah replied by saying that His promise to him of sacred leadership would not extend to the wrongdoers among his descendants."
"Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: ""Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;"" and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration.",124,2,وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا ٱلْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَٱتَّخِذُوا۟ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ مُصَلًّى وَعَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِىَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلْعَٰكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,"The Qur’ān relates that Allah made the Kaaba a place for people to return to, as a means of connecting their hearts to Him. When they travel from it, they return to it. It has also been made a safe place for them where they will not be attacked. Allah tells people to make the stone which Abraham stood on while he was building the Kaaba into a place of prayer. Allah instructed Abraham and his son Ishmael to purify the sanctuary from filth and idols for those who wish to worship in it, go around the Kaaba, stay there for worship, praying and so on."
"And when Abraham said: ""O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food,"" He answered: ""To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!""",125,2,وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَٰذَا بَلَدًا ءَامِنًا وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُۥ قَلِيلًا ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُۥٓ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Remember, O Prophet, when Abraham prayed to his Lord, asking Him to make Makkah a safe place, where no one would be faced with evil; and to provide the people who live there with all types of crops, and a special provision for those who have faith in Allah. Allah said that He would give some enjoyment to the disbelievers by giving them provision in this life; but in the next life they will be forced into the torment of the fire of Hell – a miserable place to which they return on the Day of Judgement."
"And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): ""Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;",126,2,وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Remember, O Prophet, when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the Kaaba. As they did so, they asked with humility for Allah to accept all they did, including building the Kaaba. Allah hears what we say and knows our intentions and everything that we do."
"And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;",127,2,رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"They asked Allah to make them surrender in devotion to His command, humble towards Him, not worshipping anyone besides Him; and to make their children and their descendants a nation who also surrendered in devotion to Him. They also asked Allah to teach them how to worship Him, to forgive them for their faults and shortcomings in doing what He instructed them. He turns to those who ask for forgiveness and is compassionate towards His creation."
"And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise.",128,2,رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"They asked Allah to send a messenger to their offspring from the descendants of Ishmael, to recite the revealed verses of Allah to them and teach them the Qur’ān and the Sunnah, and to purify them from worshipping others alongside Allah and from all evil. He is the Mighty in His essence, and the Wise in what He does and in His decrees."
"Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,",129,2,وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ إِلَّا مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُۥ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَٰهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"No one turns away from the religion of Abraham, peace be upon him, to other ways of life except those who do not know their own worth, and are content with humiliation. God chose him as a messenger in this world and as a friend of God, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the righteous people who fulfilled what God required them to do, and so reached the highest levels."
"(For) when his Lord said to him: ""Obey,"" he replied: ""I submit to the Lord of all the worlds.""",130,2,إِذْ قَالَ لَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥٓ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Allah chose Abraham because of his swiftness in surrendering, telling him to be faithful and devoted to Him in worship and to humbly do as He instructed. Abraham replied to his Lord saying that he had surrendered in devotion to Him, Who created His servants, providing for them and taking care of their affairs."
"And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: ""O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God).""",131,2,وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَآ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَٰبَنِىَّ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"Abraham advised his sons to also say, ‘I have surrendered to the Lord of people’; and Jacob told his sons to do the same. They told their sons that Allah had chosen for them the religion of surrendering in devotion, Islam, and to hold on to it tightly until they died, surrendering sincerely to Allah on the inside and the outside."
"Were you present at the hour of Jacob's death? ""What will you worship after me?"" he asked his sons, and they answered: ""We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit.""",132,2,أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِى قَالُوا۟ نَعْبُدُ إِلَٰهَكَ وَإِلَٰهَ ءَابَآئِكَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ إِلَٰهًا وَٰحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Were you present at the time of Jacob’s death, when he asked his sons what they would worship after he had died? They replied to him, saying that they would worship Allah, the Lord of his forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac – namely, the One Allah without partners; and they said that they surrendered in devotion to Him alone and were bound to Him."
"Those were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds.",133,2,تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلَا تُسْـَٔلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"That nation has passed away like other communities. They gained whatever they did in their lives, earning either good or evil; and you will gain what you have earned. You will not be asked about what they did, and they will not be asked about what you do. No one is held to account for the disobedience of another, but everyone is rewarded according to their own actions. You should not be distracted from paying attention to your own behaviour by looking at what those before you did. Nothing will benefit anyone except his own good actions."
"They say: ""Become Jews or become Christians, and find the right way."" Say: ""No. We follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not an idolater.""",134,2,وَقَالُوا۟ كُونُوا۟ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَٰرَىٰ تَهْتَدُوا۟ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"The Jews told the Muslims that they would have to be Jews if they were to be rightly guided; and the Christians told them that they would have to be Christians if they were to be rightly-guided. Tell them, O Prophet, in answer, that you follow the religion of Abraham, who turned away from other false ways of life to the way of truth. He did not worship others next to Allah, as some do."
"Say: ""We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord. We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him.""",135,2,قُولُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَآ أُوتِىَ ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Tell the Jews and Christians who make these baseless claims that you have faith in Allah and the Qur’ān which He revealed to you, and in what He revealed to Abraham and his sons Ishmael and Isaac, and to Jacob, and in what He revealed to the prophets from the descendants of Jacob. Say that you have faith in the Torah which Allah gave to Moses, and the Gospel which He gave to Jesus, and in all the scriptures that He gave to every one of the prophets, with no distinction between them, having faith in all of them, not only having faith in some and rejecting others. Tell them that you humbly surrender to Him alone."
"If they come to believe as you did, they will find the right path. If they turn away then they will only oppose; but God will suffice you against them, for God hears all and knows everything.",136,2,فَإِنْ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِمِثْلِ مَآ ءَامَنتُم بِهِۦ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَوا۟ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِى شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"If the Jews and the Christians, and other disbelievers, have faith in the same way that you do, then they have been guided to the right way of life which Allah is satisfied with. Yet if they turn away from faith because they reject all the prophets or some of them, then they are in disagreement and are against you. Do not be sad, O Prophet, because Allah will protect you from their harm and evil, and give you victory over them. Allah hears all that they say, and knows all their intentions and actions."
"""We have taken the colouring of God; and whose shade is better than God's? Him alone we worship.""",137,2,صِبْغَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ صِبْغَةً وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ عَٰبِدُونَ,"Hold tightly to the religion of Allah which is the natural way of life for you, on the inside and outside. There is no better way of life than the path of Allah, which agrees with our nature, benefiting us in every way and protecting us from evil and corruption. Say that you worship Allah alone and do not worship anything apart from Him."
"Say: ""Why do you dispute with us about God when He is equally your Lord and our Lord? To us belong our actions, to you yours; and we are true to Him.""",138,2,قُلْ أَتُحَآجُّونَنَا فِى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ وَلَنَآ أَعْمَٰلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَٰلُكُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ مُخْلِصُونَ,"If the People of the Scripture argue with you, saying they have more right to Allah and His religion than you do because their way of life is older and their scriptures came before yours, then it will not benefit them. Allah is the Lord of everyone, and He is not for them alone. Tell them, O Prophet, that you have your actions which they will not be asked about; and they have their actions which you will not be asked about. Everyone will be rewarded according to what they have done. Tell them that you are sincere to Allah in your worship and in doing as He instructs you, and that you do not worship anything apart from Him."
"Or do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring were Jews or Christians? Say: ""Have you more knowledge than God?"" Who is more wicked than he who conceals the testimony he received from God? God is not unaware of all you do.",139,2,أَمْ تَقُولُونَ إِنَّ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلْأَسْبَاطَ كَانُوا۟ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَٰرَىٰ قُلْ ءَأَنتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَتَمَ شَهَٰدَةً عِندَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Or do you say, O People of the Scripture, that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the prophets from Jacob’s descendants were on the path of the Jews or Christians? Ask, O Prophet, in reply to them, whether they are more knowledgeable or is Allah. If they claim that they were Jews or Christians, then what they say is false, because they were sent and died before the Torah and the Gospel were revealed. This shows that what they say is a lie against Allah and His Prophet, and that they hid the truth of what was revealed to them. No one does greater wrong than someone who hides firm evidence that they have from Allah, as some of the People of the Scripture did. Allah is not unaware of what you do, and you will be rewarded accordingly."
"They were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds.",140,2,تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلَا تُسْـَٔلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"That nation passed away before you, and earned what they earned from what they did. They have earned for themselves from their own actions; and you have earned from your own actions. You will not be asked about what they did, and they will not be asked about what you do. No one is held accountable for the disobedience of someone else, and no one benefits from what someone else does. Each person will receive his reward, according to what they themselves do."
"The foolish will now ask and say: ""What has made the faithful turn away from the Qiblah towards which they used to pray?"" Say: ""To God belong the East and the West. He guides who so wills to the path that is straight.""",141,2,سَيَقُولُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَا وَلَّىٰهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ ٱلَّتِى كَانُوا۟ عَلَيْهَا قُل لِّلَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"The foolish and weak-minded among the Jews, and those like them from among the hypocrites, will ask what turned the Muslims away from the prayer direction of Jerusalem, which was their direction of prayer before. Tell them, O Prophet, in reply, that to Allah belongs the east and the west and every direction, and He directs whomever He wills of His servants to whatever direction He wills. He guides whom He wills of His servants to the right path which is free of distortions and misguidance."
"We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you. We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God. But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace.",142,2,وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَٰكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلْقِبْلَةَ ٱلَّتِى كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَٰنَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Just as I made a direction of prayer for you, I have chosen you to be a good, just and balanced nation from among all the communities: in your beliefs and your ways of worship and in your transactions, so that you will be witnesses for the prophets of Allah on the Day of Judgement, confirming that they delivered the messages Allah instructed them to deliver to their people; and so that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) will also witness that he delivered his message to you. Allah changed the direction of prayer that you used to face (Jerusalem) to demonstrate who was content with Allah’s decree, willingly doing as He instructed and following the Messenger; and to also demonstrate who turned away from his religion, following his own desires and not obeying Allah’s sacred law. The first change of prayer direction was difficult, except for those who Allah granted faith to and who were certain that whatever He decrees for His servants has far reaching wisdom and underlying reasons behind it. Allah will not make you lose your faith in Him, or your good actions, including the prayers you prayed before the change of prayer direction. Allah is kind and compassionate with people, not overburdening them, and they will not lose the reward for their actions."
"We have seen you turn your face to the heavens. We shall turn you to a Qiblah that will please you. So turn towards the Holy Mosque, and turn towards it wherever you be. And those who are recipients of the Book surely know that this is the truth from their Lord; and God is not negligent of all that you do.",143,2,قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَىٰهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنتُمْ فَوَلُّوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُۥ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,"God saw you, O Prophet, turning your face and gazing towards the heavens, anticipating revelation about changing the direction of prayer to the place you loved. God will turn you to a prayer direction which you will be pleased with, to the Sacred House of God, instead of the prayer direction you now face, so turn your face to the Sacred House of God in Makkah, and wherever you are, O believers, turn towards it to perform your prayers. Those who have been given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, know well that the change of prayer direction is the truth revealed from their Creator Who arranges and manages their lives, as it is clear in their Scripture. God is not unaware of what those who turn away from the truth do. He, glory be to Him, is aware of everything, and will reward them according to their actions."
"Even though you bring all the proof to the people of the Book they will not face the direction you turn to, nor you theirs, nor will they follow each other's direction. And if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has reached you, then surely you will be among transgressors.",144,2,وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِكُلِّ ءَايَةٍ مَّا تَبِعُوا۟ قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُم بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"By God! If you provided the Jews and Christians who have been given the Scripture with every sign and proof that the change of prayer direction was the truth, they would not face your prayer direction, stubborn against what you say and too proud to follow the truth. You will not face their prayer direction after God has directed you away from it, and they will not face the prayer directions of one another, because each group calls the other disbelievers, and because they follow their desires in the matter of the prayer direction and in other sacred laws and rulings, even after the true knowledge which was revealed to you and about which there is no doubt. If you were to leave guidance, and follow their desires, you would certainly be of the wrongdoers. Here God addresses the Prophet(s) directly to show how wrong it would be to follow them. Of course, God has protected the prophet himself from ever doing so, and this as a warning for his followers after him."
Those to whom We have sent down the Book know this even as they know their sons. Yet a section among them conceals the truth knowingly.,145,2,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَعْرِفُونَهُۥ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقًا مِّنْهُمْ لَيَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"The scholars of the Jews and the Christians to whom Allah gave the scripture recognise Muhammad (peace be upon him) as completely as they recognise their own children and distinguish them from others. Nevertheless, a group of them hide the truth that has come to them, out of envy, fully aware that it is the truth."
"The truth is from your Lord, so be not among those who are sceptics.",146,2,ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,"This is the truth from your Lord, so make absolutely certain, O Messenger, that you are not one of those who doubt its truth."
Each has a goal to which he turns. So strive towards piety and excel the others: God will bring you all together wheresoever you be. God has power over everything.,147,2,وَلِكُلٍّ وِجْهَةٌ هُوَ مُوَلِّيهَا فَٱسْتَبِقُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ أَيْنَ مَا تَكُونُوا۟ يَأْتِ بِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Every nation has a direction they turn to, whether physically or spiritually. For this reason, there is a difference between them in their directions of prayer and in their sacred laws. There is nothing wrong with them facing different directions if it is by Allah’s command and law, so try to outdo each other, O believers, in doing the good actions that you have been instructed to do. Allah will bring you together from wherever you may be on the Day of Judgement, to reward you according to what you have done. Allah has power over all things. It is not difficult for Him to bring you all together and reward you."
Wherever you come from turn towards the Holy Mosque: This in truth is from your Lord. God is not negligent of all you do.,148,2,وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Wherever you come from and wherever you are, you, O Prophet, and your followers are to face towards the Sacred Mosque (the Kaaba in Makkah) when you want to pray. It is the truth that has been revealed to you from your Lord. Allah is not unaware of what you do. Rather, He is aware of all that you do, and you will be rewarded accordingly."
"Whichever place you come from turn towards the Holy Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it so that people may have no cause for argument against you, except such among them as are wicked. But do not fear them, fear Me that I may accomplish My favours on you, and you may find the right way perchance.",149,2,وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنتُمْ فَوَلُّوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُۥ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِى وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِى عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Wherever you come from, O Prophet, when you want to pray, turn towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, O believers, turn your face towards it if you want to pray, so that the people will have no argument against you, except those of them who are wrongdoers. They will remain in their stubbornness, arguing against you with the weakest of arguments. Do not fear them, but fear your Lord alone, following His instructions and keeping away from what He has prohibited. Allah instructed you to face the Kaaba to perfect His blessings upon you, distinguishing you from all other communities and guiding you to the noblest direction of prayer."
"Even as We sent a messenger from among you to convey Our messages to you and cleanse you, and teach you the Book and the wisdom, and what you did not know;",150,2,كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولًا مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُوا۟ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah blessed you in another way: sending a messenger to you from among you, who recites His verses, purifying you by directing you to virtue and goodness and forbidding you from evil and wrong, teaching you the Qur’ān and the Sunnah, and teaching you worldly and sacred knowledge which you did not know."
"So, therefore, remember Me, and I shall remember you; and give thanks and do not be ungrateful.",151,2,فَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ,"So, remember Allah with your hearts and your whole beings, and He will remember you with approval and protection, for you are rewarded according to what you do. Also, be grateful to Allah for the blessings He has given you, and do not be ungrateful by denying them or using them in prohibited ways."
"O you who believe, seek courage in fortitude and prayer, for God is with those who are patient and persevere.",152,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, ask for help from Allah in everything, through the beauty of patience and by establishing the prayer in the way Allah has instructed. Allah is truly with those who are patient, giving them success and helping them."
"Do not say that those who are killed in the way of God, are dead, for indeed they are alive, even though you are not aware.",153,2,وَلَا تَقُولُوا۟ لِمَن يُقْتَلُ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَٰتٌۢ بَلْ أَحْيَآءٌ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تَشْعُرُونَ,"Do not say, O believers, about those who are killed whilst striving in Allah’s path that they are dead just as others are; rather, they are alive with their Lord, but you do not realise that they are living, because the way in which they are alive can only be understood through revelation from Allah."
"Be sure We shall try you with something of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and life and the fruits (of your labour); but give tidings of happiness to those who have patience,",154,2,وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَىْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلْأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Allah will test people with different types of hardships: some with fear of those who are against them; hunger because of lack of food; lack of money because of losing it or difficulty gaining it; loss of lives due to death from diseases and tragedies that kill people, or being martyred for the sake of Allah; and a lack of resources from the earth. Give good news, O Prophet, to those who are patient in the face of these hardships, of what will make them happy in this world and in the Afterlife."
"Who say when assailed by adversity: ""Surely we are for God, and to Him we shall return.""",155,2,ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّآ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ,"The patient are those who, when they are struck by one of these hardships, say, in acceptance, that all power belongs to Allah, He deals with us as He wills, and we will return to Him on the Day of Judgement, and it is He Who created us and showers us with many blessings; so, to Him is our return and our end."
"On such men are the blessings of God and His mercy, for they are indeed on the right path.",156,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَٰتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُهْتَدُونَ,"Those who possess these virtues are praised by Allah in the highest gathering of angels, and mercy descends on them. They are the ones guided to the path of truth."
"Truly Safa and Marwa are the symbols of God. Whoever goes on pilgrimage to the House (of God), or on a holy visit, is not guilty of wrong if he walk around them; and he who does good of his own accord will find appreciation with God who knows everything.",157,2,إِنَّ ٱلصَّفَا وَٱلْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ ٱلْبَيْتَ أَوِ ٱعْتَمَرَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,"The two mountains known as Ṣafā and Marwah, near to the Kaaba, are landmarks of the clear sacred law. Whoever goes to the Kaaba to perform the acts of Hajj or Umrah, there is no fault in them walking between the two mountains. By clarifying that there was no fault in this action, Allah was comforting those Muslims who avoided walking between the mountains because they feared it was an unacceptable action from the time of ignorance before Islam; but Allah made it clear that the walking between the mountains was an acceptable act of Hajj. Whoever sincerely does what is recommended of voluntary sacred acts, Allah acknowledges them and rewards them. He is aware of who does good and is worthy of being rewarded."
"They who conceal Our signs and the guidance We have sent them and have made clear in the Book, are condemned of God and are condemned by those who are worthy of condemning.",158,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَٱلْهُدَىٰ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّٰهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَلْعَنُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ ٱللَّٰعِنُونَ,"Those Jews and Christians who hide the clear proofs which Allah revealed showing the truth of the Prophet and what he brought, after Allah had made it clear to the people in their scriptures, Allah removes them from His mercy; and all the angels, the prophets and people call for them to be removed from His mercy."
"But those who repent and reform and proclaim (the truth), are forgiven, for I am forgiving and merciful.",159,2,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ وَأَصْلَحُوا۟ وَبَيَّنُوا۟ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنَا ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"The exception is those who repent to Allah, asking for forgiveness, and regretting having hidden these clear signs, correcting what they do outwardly and inwardly, and making clear the truth and guidance which they had hidden. Allah accepts their repentance to Him. He turns to those who turn to Him, asking for forgiveness and regretting what they have done, and He forgives and is compassionate with them."
"But those who deny, and die disbelieving, bear the condemnation of God and the angels and that of all men,",160,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَمَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Those who disbelieve and die in disbelief, not having repented, they are condemned by Allah by being removed from His mercy; and the angels and people all call for them to be removed and excluded from Allah’s mercy."
"Under which they will live, and their suffering will neither decrease nor be respite for them.",161,2,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا لَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"They will always be condemned, and their punishment will not be lightened, not even for a day; and they will not be given any extra time on the Day of Judgement."
"Your God is one God; there is no god other than He, the compassionate, ever-merciful.",162,2,وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ لَّآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O people, your Allah is the true Allah, the One, unique in His essence and attributes. There is no other true god, and He is the Merciful and His mercy is vast. He is Compassionate with His creation, surrounding them with many blessings."
"Creation of the heavens and the earth, alternation of night and day, and sailing of ships across the ocean with what is useful to man, and the rain that God sends from the sky enlivening the earth that was dead, and the scattering of beasts of all kinds upon it, and the changing of the winds, and the clouds which remain obedient between earth and sky, are surely signs for the wise.",163,2,إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَٰحِ وَٱلسَّحَابِ ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"The following are clear signs of the Oneness of Allah, glory be to Him, for those who understand the evidence and proof: the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the wonders in them; the succession of night and day; the passing of life and death; happiness and sorrow; wealth and poverty; ships that sail through the waters of the sea, carrying food, clothing, trade and other things that people need and which benefit them; water that Allah sends down, bringing the earth to life with the agriculture and pasture that grows in it, and the living creatures He spreads out in it; the changing of the winds from one direction to another; and the clouds, controlled between the sky and the earth."
"And yet there are men who take others as compeers of God, and bestow on them love due to God; but the love of the faithful for God is more intense. If only the wicked could see now the agony that they will behold (on the Day of Resurrection), they will know that to God belongs the power entirely'. And the punishment of God is severe.",164,2,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَادًا يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِّلَّهِ وَلَوْ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلْقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"Even with these clear signs, there are people who take others besides Allah as their gods, considering them equal to Him, and loving them as they love Allah. Those who have real faith love Allah more than those others love their gods: they do not worship anyone besides Him; and they love Him in hardship and in ease, while those others only love their gods when things are going well – when things go badly, they call on Allah alone. If the wrongdoers could see with their own eyes the punishment that waits in the Afterlife for those who worship others with Allah and commit sins, then they would know that all power belongs to Allah alone and that He is firm in punishing those who stubbornly rebel. If they saw this, then they would not worship anyone with Allah."
"When those who were followed will disclaim those who followed them, and see the torment all ties between them shall be severed,",165,2,إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتُّبِعُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوا۟ وَرَأَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ ٱلْأَسْبَابُ,"Then the leaders who were followed in disbelief will reject the weak people who followed them because of seeing the terrors and hardships of the Day of Judgement; so, all ties and means of escape will be cut off from them."
"And the followers will say: ""Could we live but once again we would leave them as they have abandoned us now."" God will show them thus their deeds, and fill them with remorse; but never shall they find release from the Fire.",166,2,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوا۟ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُوا۟ مِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ حَسَرَٰتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَٰرِجِينَ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,"The weak and those who followed will say, ‘If only we could go back to the earth, we would reject our leaders as they reject us’. Allah shows them the severe punishment in the Afterlife and the consequence of following their leaders in falsehood: regrets and sorrow, and they will never leave the fire of Hell."
"O men, eat only the things of the earth that are lawful and good. Do not walk in the footsteps of Satan, your acknowledged enemy.",167,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ كُلُوا۟ مِمَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ حَلَٰلًا طَيِّبًا وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"O people, eat from the meat, vegetables and fruits of the earth which are lawful and good, and not harmful. Do not follow the actions of Satan and his evil whisperings: he is a clear enemy who is hostile to you – anyone with sense would not follow an enemy who wants to harm and mislead them."
"He will ask you to indulge in evil, indecency, and to speak lies of God you cannot even conceive.",168,2,إِنَّمَا يَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلسُّوٓءِ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَأَن تَقُولُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Satan only commands harmful, evil actions and disobedience that will bring hardship, as well as for you to say things about faith in Allah and His sacred laws that have not been given to you by Allah or His Prophet."
"When it is said to them: ""Follow what God has revealed,"" they reply: ""No, we shall follow only what our fathers had practiced,"" -- even though their fathers had no wisdom or guidance!",169,2,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوا۟ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَآ أَلْفَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ,"If these disbelievers are told to follow the guidance and light which Allah revealed, they say, resisting stubbornly, that they will follow the beliefs and customs that their fathers followed. Do they follow their fathers even though they understood nothing of guidance or the light, and were not guided to the truth that Allah accepts?"
"The semblance of the infidels is that of a man who shouts to one that cannot hear more than a call and a cry. They are deaf, dumb and blind, and they fail to understand.",170,2,وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلَّا دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً صُمٌّۢ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"The example of those who disbelieve and stubbornly follow the path of their fathers is like the example of the shepherd who shouts, calling to his animals that hear his voice, but do not understand what he says. They are deaf to hearing the truth so that it will benefit them, dumb as they are unable to speak about the truth, and blind to seeing it, and because of this they do not understand the guidance which you call them to."
"O believers, eat what is good of the food We have given you, and be grateful to God, if indeed you are obedient to Him.",171,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُلُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٰكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِلَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, consume the good things that Allah has provided and allowed for you; and be thankful to Allah, outwardly and inwardly, for the overwhelming blessings He has given you. Part of being thankful to Him is acting with complete devotion to Him and not going against Him, if you truly worship Him alone, and do not worship anything besides Him."
"Forbidden to you are carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and that which has been consecrated (or killed) in the name of any other than God. If one is obliged by necessity to eat it without intending to transgress, or reverting to it, he is not guilty of sin; for God is forgiving and kind.",172,2,إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ بِهِۦ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلَا عَادٍ فَلَآ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah has only forbidden you from consuming that which died without being sacrificed according to the sacred law and having its blood flow, the meat of pigs and what has had other than Allah’s name mentioned over it when it was sacrificed. Yet if someone is forced to eat something of these forbidden types, and does not sin by eating it when they are not in need, nor do they go beyond the limit of what is necessary, then they have done no wrong and will receive no punishment. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate to whomever repents to Him; and it is from His mercy that He overlooks the eating of forbidden things when it is necessary."
"Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures that God has revealed, and thus make a little profit thereby, take nothing but fire as food; and God will not turn to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor nourish them for growth; and their doom will be painful.",173,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِى بُطُونِهِمْ إِلَّا ٱلنَّارَ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who hide what Allah revealed in the scriptures and the signs of the truth and prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) – as the Jews and Christians did, getting something small in return for what they hide, such as leadership, status or money – they only fill their stomachs with that which will cause them to suffer in the fire of Hell. Then on the Day of Judgement, Allah will not speak to them with words that make them joyful; but they will only hear that which makes them sad: they will not be praised, and they will have a painful punishment."
"They are those who bartered away good guidance for error, and pardon for punishment: How great is their striving for the Fire",174,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْعَذَابَ بِٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ فَمَآ أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"Those who hide knowledge exchange guidance for misguidance, as they hid the truth, and exchange the forgiveness of Allah for His punishment. How determined they are to do things that will lead them into the fire of Hell, as if they do not realize what suffering it contains!"
That is because God has revealed the Book containing the truth; but those who are at variance about it have gone astray in their contrariness.,175,2,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَفِى شِقَاقٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"That punishment is what they get for hiding knowledge and guidance, because Allah revealed the sacred scriptures in truth, which must be made clear and not hidden. Also, those who disagree with the sacred scripture, believing some of it and hiding some of it, have taken a position that is far from the truth."
"Piety does not lie in turning your face to East or West: Piety lies in believing in God, the Last Day and the angels, the Scriptures and the prophets, and disbursing your wealth out of love for God among your kin and the orphans, the wayfarers and mendicants, freeing the slaves, observing your devotional obligations, and in paying the zakat and fulfilling a pledge you have given, and being patient in hardship, adversity, and times of peril. These are the men who affirm the truth, and they are those who follow the straight path.",176,2,لَّيْسَ ٱلْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ وَءَاتَى ٱلْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِۦ ذَوِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَٱلسَّآئِلِينَ وَفِى ٱلرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَى ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱلْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَٰهَدُوا۟ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ فِى ٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَحِينَ ٱلْبَأْسِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا۟ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,"Doing good that pleases Allah does not just mean turning towards the east or the west or disputing about that. Rather, it is having faith in Allah as the only God, the Day of Judgement, all of the angels, all of the revealed scriptures and all of the prophets, without distinguishing between them; charitable spending, despite loving and valuing wealth, to relatives, orphans, the poor, the stranger who is cut off from his family and homeland because of a journey, and whoever has a need that makes it necessary for them to ask people for help; giving money to free slaves from captivity; establishing the prayer as Allah instructed; giving Zakat; being true to promises; and patience in poverty, hardship, illness and in times of conflict without fleeing. Such people are those who are true to Allah in their faith and in what they do. They are the Mindful who follow what Allah has instructed them to do, and who stay away from what Allah has prohibited."
"O believers, ordained for you is retribution for the murdered, (whether) a free man (is guilty) of (the murder of) a free man, or a slave of a slave, or a woman of a woman. But he who is pardoned some of it by his brother should be dealt with equity, and recompense (for blood) paid with a grace. This is a concession from your Lord and a kindness. He who transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment.",177,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِصَاصُ فِى ٱلْقَتْلَى ٱلْحُرُّ بِٱلْحُرِّ وَٱلْعَبْدُ بِٱلْعَبْدِ وَٱلْأُنثَىٰ بِٱلْأُنثَىٰ فَمَنْ عُفِىَ لَهُۥ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَىْءٌ فَٱتِّبَاعٌۢ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَآءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَٰنٍ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُۥ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, it is decreed for you that in cases where someone deliberately attacks and kills someone, the punishment for the murderer should be the same as their crime: the freeman killed for the freeman; the slave for the slave; and the female for the female. If the person killed had forgiven before his death, or his guardian has forgiven in return for the payment of blood money (a sum of money paid by the murderer in return for being pardoned), then the person who forgives should ask for the sum of money fairly, and not follow that up with insult or injury, and the murderer should pay the sum of money in a good way, without hesitation or delay. In allowing this forgiveness and the payment of the blood money your Lord makes things easier for you, and this is a mercy for the Muslim nation. Whoever attacks the murderer after his pardon and the acceptance of the blood money will receive a painful punishment from Allah."
"In retribution there is life (and preservation). O men of sense, you may haply take heed for yourselves.",178,2,وَلَكُمْ فِى ٱلْقِصَاصِ حَيَوٰةٌ يَٰٓأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"In the law of equivalent punishment decreed by Allah there is life for you, because it spares your blood, stopping further attacks between you. Those with sense understand this: who are mindful of Allah, keeping to His sacred law and doing as He instructs."
"It is ordained that when any one of you nears death, and he owns goods and chattels, he should bequeath them equitably to his parents and next of kin. This is binding on those who are upright and fear God.",179,2,كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِن تَرَكَ خَيْرًا ٱلْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبِينَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"It has been decreed for you that if one of you is about to die, and they are leaving a large amount of wealth behind, then they should make a will for their parents and close relatives, according to the sacred laws, not exceeding one third of the wealth (the rest of the wealth being distributed according to the laws of inheritance). Making this will is a firm duty on those who are mindful of Allah. This ruling was revealed before the verses about inheritance. When the verses about inheritance were revealed it was made clear who should inherit from the person who has died and how much they should inherit."
"And any one who changes the will, having heard it, shall be guilty and accountable; for God hears all and knows everything.",180,2,فَمَنۢ بَدَّلَهُۥ بَعْدَمَا سَمِعَهُۥ فَإِنَّمَآ إِثْمُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Whoever then changes the will, adding to it or taking away from it or stopping something when they know what the will contains, the sin of it will be upon those who changed it, and the person who wrote the will is not held responsible for what they did. Allah hears all that His creation say, and knows all that they do; and He knows every detail of the situations they are in."
"He who suspects wrong or partiality on the part of the testator and brings about a settlement, does not incure any guilt, for God is verily forgiving and merciful.",181,2,فَمَنْ خَافَ مِن مُّوصٍ جَنَفًا أَوْ إِثْمًا فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلَآ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Whoever knows that there is an error in judgement from the person who made the will, or that there is some injustice in it, and advises the person and rectifies the wrong, and reconciles between those who are in disagreement about it, then there is no blame on them; rather they are rewarded for putting things right. Allah is Forgiving towards whomever of His servants repents to Him, and is Compassionate with them."
"O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous.",182,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Prophet, Allah has ordered you to fast, as He ordered those before you, so that you may become mindful of Allah, protecting yourself from His punishment by doing good actions – fasting being one of the best of these."
"Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person. For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men. And if you fast it is good for you, if you knew.",183,2,أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَٰتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُۥ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُۥ وَأَن تَصُومُوا۟ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"You are ordered to fast for a small number of days in the year. Yet whoever of you is ill, with an illness that makes fasting difficult, or travelling, then they do not need to fast; but they can make up for these days by fasting the same number of other days. Those who are able to fast, but do not, should compensate by feeding a poor person for every day they did not fast. Fasting is better for you than not fasting and feeding a poor person instead, if you only knew what goodness there is in fasting. This was the first of Allah’s laws about fasting: whoever wanted to fast did so; and whoever did not want to fast was permitted not to, and fed a poor person instead. Afterwards Allah made fasting a duty for every able person who has reached puberty."
"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth). So when you see the new moon you should fast the whole month; but a person who is ill or travelling (and fails to do so) should fast on other days, as God wishes ease and not hardship for you, so that you complete the (fixed) number (of fasts), and give glory to God for the guidance, and be grateful.",184,2,شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا۟ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"The Qur’ān was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on the Night of Decree in the month of Ramadan. Allah revealed it as a guidance for people, with clear proofs of its guidance, and the criterion between the truth and falsehood. Whoever reaches the month of Ramadan, and is well and healthy, is required to fast; and whoever is ill, or for whom fasting is difficult, or is travelling, then they may break their fast. If they do not fast then they must perform make-up fasts for the days they missed at another time. Allah intends ease, and not hardship, in what He decrees for you; and wants you to complete the right number of days and to glorify Him upon the completion of Ramadan, on the day of Eid, as He helped you and made it possible for you to fast, so that you thank Allah for guiding you to this religion which He has approved for you."
"When My devotees enquire of you about Me, I am near, and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls. It behoves them to hearken to Me and believe in Me that they may follow the right path.",185,2,وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِى لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ,"If they ask you, O Prophet, about how close Allah is and about His answering of prayers, Allah is close to them and knows everything about them. He hears their prayer, and they do not need intermediaries or to raise their voices. Allah responds to the call of whoever calls Him sincerely, praying to Him; so, let them be devoted to Him and His sacred law, firm in their faith, as that is the best route to Allah’s response – perhaps in that way they might be rightly guided in worldly and sacred matters."
"You are allowed to sleep with your wives on the nights of the fast: They are your dress as you are theirs. God is aware you were cheating yourselves, so He turned to you and pardoned you. So now you may have intercourse with them, and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears clear from the dark line, then fast until the night falls; and abstain from your wives (when you have decided) to stay in the mosques for assiduous devotion. These are the bounds fixed by God, so keep well within them. So does God make His signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves.",186,2,أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ ٱلصِّيَامِ ٱلرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَآئِكُمْ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ فَٱلْـَٰٔنَ بَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَٱبْتَغُوا۟ مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَكُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ ٱلْخَيْطُ ٱلْأَبْيَضُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْطِ ٱلْأَسْوَدِ مِنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا۟ ٱلصِّيَامَ إِلَى ٱلَّيْلِ وَلَا تُبَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَٰكِفُونَ فِى ٱلْمَسَٰجِدِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا تَقْرَبُوهَا كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"At first it was not allowed for a man, if he had gone to sleep on the night of the fast and then woke up before dawn, to eat or drink, or approach his wife. Allah replaced this ruling, allowing you, O believers, to have relations with your wives during the nights of fasting. They are a protection for you, keeping you pure, and you are a cover for them, keeping them pure. You both need each other. Allah knew that you were betraying yourselves by doing what you were not allowed to, so He had mercy on you, turning to you when you asked for forgiveness, and made things easier for you. So, have relations with them, and seek the children Allah has decreed you, and eat and drink during the whole of the night, until the break of true dawn is clear to you. Then complete your fast, not consuming anything from the break of dawn until sunset. But do not have relations with your wives when you are in spiritual retreat in the mosques, because that invalidates the retreat. These laws are the limits of Allah: between what is allowed and what is forbidden– so do not go near them. Whoever goes near the limits of Allah is close to falling into what is prohibited. By clearly setting out such laws, Allah makes His signs obvious to people so that they may be mindful of Him, and do what He instructs and leave what He has prohibited."
"And do not consume each other's wealth in vain, nor offer it to men in authority with intent of usurping unlawfully and knowingly a part of the wealth of others.",187,2,وَلَا تَأْكُلُوٓا۟ أَمْوَٰلَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتُدْلُوا۟ بِهَآ إِلَى ٱلْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُوا۟ فَرِيقًا مِّنْ أَمْوَٰلِ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْإِثْمِ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Do not take each other’s wealth unjustly: robbing it or taking it by force or by cheating, and then making it a legal dispute in order to obtain other’s wealth wrongfully, when you know that Allah has prohibited that. Committing a sin knowingly is the worst of things and has the greatest of punishments."
"They ask you of the new moons. Say: ""These are periods set for men (to reckon) time, and for pilgrimage."" Piety does not lie in entering the house through the back door, for the pious man is he who follows the straight path. Enter the house through the main gate, and obey God. You may haply find success.",188,2,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْأَهِلَّةِ قُلْ هِىَ مَوَٰقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱلْحَجِّ وَلَيْسَ ٱلْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُوا۟ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأْتُوا۟ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَٰبِهَا وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"They ask you, O Messenger, about the formation of the new moons and their changing states. Tell them in reply about the wisdom behind them: that they measure time for people, so that they know when to do their acts of worship, such as the months of Hajj and fasting, and the completion of the year for Zakat; they also fix the time frames of transactions, such as the deadlines for paying blood money or debts. It is not righteousness or goodness that you come to houses from the rear wearing your iḥrām for Hajj or Umrah, as they used to claim during the time of ignorance before Islam. Rather, true righteousness is the righteousness of whoever is mindful, outwardly and inwardly. So, enter houses from their correct doors, because it is easier for you and less troublesome. Allah does not overburden you with difficulty, so protect yourself from the punishment of Allah by doing good, in order that you may be successful in achieving what you wish for, and in escaping from what you fear."
"Fight those in the way of God who fight you, but do not be aggressive: God does not like aggressors.",189,2,وَقَٰتِلُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"Fight in order to raise the word of Allah, against those of the disbelievers who fight you to turn you away from the religion of Allah; but do not overstep the limits of Allah by killing children, women, the elderly, or by mutilating the dead and so on. Allah does not love those who overstep the limits He has established and made sacred."
"And fight those (who fight you) wheresoever you find them, and expel them from the place they had turned you out from. Oppression is worse than killing. Do not fight them by the Holy Mosque unless they fight you there. If they do, then slay them: Such is the requital for unbelievers.",190,2,وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلَا تُقَٰتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَٰتَلُوكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"And kill them where you come across them, and make them leave the place they made you leave - which is Makkah. And oppression that stops those who believe from worshipping, making them return to disbelief and ungratefulness is worse than killing. And do not fight with them in the Sacred Mosque, out of respect for it, unless they start fighting you there. If they start fighting in the Sacred Mosque, then kill them. And fighting them if they attack in the Sacred mosque is the reward of those who deny the truth."
"But if they desist, God is forgiving and kind.",191,2,فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"If these aggressive disbelievers stop fighting you and stop disbelieving, then stop fighting them. Allah Forgiving to whomever repents to Him with regret, asking for forgiveness, and does not hold them to account for the disobedience they did before. He is Compassionate with them and not quick to punish."
"Fight them till sedition comes to end, and the law of God (prevails). If they desist, then cease to be hostile, except against those who oppress.",192,2,وَقَٰتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ ٱلدِّينُ لِلَّهِ فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْا۟ فَلَا عُدْوَٰنَ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Fight the disbelievers until they do not prevent people from Allah’s path and there is no disbelief, and until the dominant way of life is the path of Allah. But if they stop their disbelief and stop preventing others from the path of Allah, then stop fighting them. There is to be no aggression except against those who oppress, through disbelief and by preventing people from the path of Allah."
"(Fighting during) the holy month (if the sanctity) of the holy month (is violated) is (just) retribution. So if you are oppressed, oppress those who oppress you to the same degree, and fear God, and know that God is with those who are pious and follow the right path.",193,2,ٱلشَّهْرُ ٱلْحَرَامُ بِٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱلْحُرُمَٰتُ قِصَاصٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱعْتَدُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"The sacred month in which Allah allowed you to enter the Sacred Mosque and perform Umrah in the seventh year after the Migration is a compensation for the sacred month when you were stopped by the idolaters from entering the Sacred Mosque in the sixth year after the Migration. The law of equality applies when the limits are overstepped in regards to sacred things, such as the sacred land, the sacred month and being in an ordered state of purity (iḥrām) for pilgrimage to the Sacred Mosque. When someone wrongs you in any of these, treat them as they treated you, but do not go beyond what they have done: Allah does not love those who overstep His limits. Be mindful of Allah by not going beyond what He has given you permission to do. Know that Allah is with those who are mindful of Him, giving them success and supporting them."
"Spend in the way of God, and do not seek destruction at your own hands. So do good for God loves those who do good.",194,2,وَأَنفِقُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا تُلْقُوا۟ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى ٱلتَّهْلُكَةِ وَأَحْسِنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Spend your wealth in obedience to Allah, in striving for His sake, and do not throw yourselves into destruction, by leaving the struggle and spending for His sake, or by throwing yourselves into something that will cause your destruction. Behave with excellence and kindness in your worship, transactions and behaviour. Allah loves those who always do good: giving them a greater reward and leading them to true guidance."
"Perform the pilgrimage and holy visit ('Umra, to Makkah) in the service of God. But if you are prevented, send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice. But if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp (preventing the shaving of hair), then offer expiation by fasting or else giving alms or a sacrificial offering. When you have security, then those of you who wish to perform the holy visit along with the pilgrimage, should make a sacrifice according to their means. But he who has nothing, should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven on return, completing ten. This applies to him whose family does not live near the Holy Mosque. Have fear of God, and remember that God is severe in punishment.",195,2,وَأَتِمُّوا۟ ٱلْحَجَّ وَٱلْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْىِ وَلَا تَحْلِقُوا۟ رُءُوسَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْهَدْىُ مَحِلَّهُۥ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ بِهِۦٓ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِۦ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِٱلْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى ٱلْحَجِّ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْىِ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَٰثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِى ٱلْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُۥ حَاضِرِى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"Perform Hajj and Umrah in a complete way, seeking only Allah’s pleasure. If you are prevented from completing them by illness or an enemy, then you should sacrifice what is easily available of sacrificial animals, such as camels, cows or sheep, before you take off your Iḥrām, and do not shave your heads or cut your hair until the sacrificial animals have reached their place. If you are prevented from entering the Sacred Sanctuary, then perform the sacrifice wherever you have stopped; yet if you can enter it, then do it on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah) or at least within the days of tashrīq (11, 12 and 13 of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah). Whoever among you is ill or has some problem with his hair or his head, like lice or something similar, whoever shaved his head for that reason, then that is not a problem; but they should instead fast for three days, or feed six poor people from the area of the Sanctuary, or sacrifice a sheep to be distributed among the poor of the Sanctuary. If you are living in times of peace, then whoever takes the opportunity to perform Umrah in the months of Hajj, enjoying in between those things that are not allowed when performing the pilgrimages, they should sacrifice whatever is easily available: a sheep, or a seventh of a camel or cow. If they are unable to make a sacrifice, then they must fast for three days during the days of Hajj to make up for it, and seven more days when they return home, making ten days all together. This practice of having a break between Umrah and Hajj and sacrificing an animal or fasting for those unable to make a sacrifice is only for people who do not live within or close to the Sanctuary of the Sacred Mosque. As for those who live within the Sanctuary or close to it, they do not do this, because they have no need to due to their constant being there and enjoying being able to make Umrah or Tawaf freely any other time of the year. Be mindful of Allah by following what He makes sacred law, and by respecting His limits, and know that Allah is firm in punishing those who go against what He instructs."
"Known are the months of pilgrimage. If one resolves to perform the pilgrimage in these months, let him not indulge in concupiscence, sin or quarrel. And the good you do shall be known to God. Provide for the journey, and the best of provisions is piety. O men of understanding, obey Me.",196,2,ٱلْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَٰتٌ فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ ٱلْحَجَّ فَلَا رَفَثَ وَلَا فُسُوقَ وَلَا جِدَالَ فِى ٱلْحَجِّ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَتَزَوَّدُوا۟ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ ٱلزَّادِ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُونِ يَٰٓأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"The time of the Hajj is the well-known months, starting with the month of Shawwāl and ending on the 10th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah. Sexual relations and things that lead to it are prohibited for any person who decides to perform the Hajj in these months once he enters the state of iḥrām. In addition, the prohibition of going against Allah by committing sins becomes even more emphasised at this time due to the sacredness of the time and place. The pilgrim may not quarrel with anyone: causing them to become angry and leading to a fight. If you do any good, Allah knows and will reward you for it. To perform the Hajj, take an adequate amount of food and drink, but remember that the best provision is being always mindful of Allah. O people of sound mind, fear Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"It is no sin to seek the favours of your Lord (by trading). When you start from 'Arafat in a concourse, remember God at the monument that is sacred (al-Mash'ar al-haram), and remember Him as He has shown you the way, for in the olden days you we're a people astray.",197,2,لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا۟ فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَإِذَآ أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَٰتٍ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عِندَ ٱلْمَشْعَرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَإِن كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلِهِۦ لَمِنَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,"There is no sin in seeking lawful provision by trading or other ways during the Hajj. When you leave Arafat after having spent the day there on the 9th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, and when you head towards Muzdalifah on the night before the 10th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, remember Allah by glorifying and praising Him and by praying to Him at the sacred place in Muzdalifah. Remember that Allah has guided you to the teachings of His path, and the acts of Hajj to His House: you were unaware of the sacred laws before this."
"Then move with the crowd impetuously, and pray God to forgive you your sins. God is surely forgiving and kind.",198,2,ثُمَّ أَفِيضُوا۟ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Then leave Arafat just as the Prophet Abraham used to do, and do not leave out stopping at Arafat as the people of ignorance used to do. Seek forgiveness from Allah for any defects in the performance of the Hajj, for Allah is Forgiving towards those of His servants who repent and He is Merciful towards them."
"When you have finished the rites and ceremonies, remember God as you do your fathers, in fact with a greater devotion. There are some who say: ""Give us, O Lord, in the world;"" but they will forego their share in the life to come.",199,2,فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُم مَّنَٰسِكَكُمْ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ءَابَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا فَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَٰقٍ,"When you have completed the acts of Hajj, remember and praise Him much, just as you boast about and praise your forefathers – or even more than that because every favour that you enjoy comes from Him. People are different: some are disbelieving idolaters who only believe in this worldly life. Such people will only ask Allah for the blessing of this world and its beauty in the form of health, wealth and children, and will not receive anything of what Allah has prepared for His faithful servants in the Afterlife. This is because of their desire for this world and their neglect of the Afterlife."
"But some there are who pray: ""Give us of good in the world, O Lord, and give us of good in the life to come, and suffer us not to suffer the torment of Hell.""",200,2,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,"Yet there is another group of people who have faith in Allah and the Afterlife who ask their Lord for blessing in this world and the ability to do good, just as they ask Him for entry into Paradise and safety from the punishment of the fire of Hell."
They are those who will surely have their share of whatsoever they have earned; for God is swift at the reckoning.,201,2,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا كَسَبُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Those that pray for the good of this world and the Afterlife will receive their share of the great reward for their good actions in the world. Allah is swift in taking account of actions: He will reward those that do good and take those that do evil to task.
"Remember God during the stated days; but if a person comes away after two days, it will not be a sin; and if one tarries, he will not transgress, if he keep away from evil. Follow the law of God, and remember that you will have to gather before Him in the end.",202,2,وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ فِىٓ أَيَّامٍ مَّعْدُودَٰتٍ فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَآ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلَآ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"Remember Allah by saying, ‘Allāhu Akbar’ (Allah is greatest!), and, ‘Lā ilāhah illā Allāh’ (There is no god except Allah), on the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah. If anyone is in a hurry, he may leave Minā after pelting stones on the 12th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah – and there will be no sin as Allah has granted that permission. It is also acceptable if someone stays to pelt stones on the 13th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah – in fact, this is better and was the action of the Prophet (peace be upon him). All of this applies to those that are mindful of Allah during their Hajj and carry it out in accordance with Allah’s instruction. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Be sure that you will return to Him alone and He will recompense you for your actions."
"There is a man who talks well of the world to your pleasing, and makes God witness to what is in his heart, yet he is the most contentious;",203,2,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُۥ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِى قَلْبِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ ٱلْخِصَامِ,"There is a type of person who is actually a Hypocrite, but his speech with respect to the life of this world impresses you, O Prophet, and you consider him to be honest and sincere because of his wonderful words. However, his only goal in speaking words of faith is to protect his personal and financial interests. He calls Allah to witness that he has faith and goodness in his heart whilst he is in fact lying: he bears great hostility and hatred for the Muslims."
"For when his back is turned he goes about spreading disorder in the land, destroying fields and flocks; but God does not love disorder.",204,2,وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ ٱلْحَرْثَ وَٱلنَّسْلَ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْفَسَادَ,"When this Hypocrite leaves you, he works hard to cause corruption by committing sins, and he destroys crops and kills animals. Allah does not love corruption in the land and He does not love those that cause corruption."
"Whenever he is told: ""Obey God,"" his arrogance leads him to more sin; and sufficient for him shall be Hell: How evil a place of wide expanse!",205,2,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ ٱلْعِزَّةُ بِٱلْإِثْمِ فَحَسْبُهُۥ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,"When this person who causes corruption is advised to be mindful of Allah by respecting His limits and avoiding His prohibitions, his pride and arrogance prevents him from repenting, and he continues to sin. The only appropriate reward for him is entry into Hell. What a terrible place to reside in for its inhabitants!"
And there is a man who is willing to sell even his soul to win the favour of God; and God is compassionate to His creatures.,206,2,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ رَءُوفٌۢ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"There is another type of person who is a believer, who will sell and give up his soul to follow his Lord and to strive in His path seeking His pleasure. Allah’s mercy for His servants is vast and He is Kind to them."
"O believers, come to full submission to God. Do not follow in the footsteps of Satan your acknowledged foe.",207,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ فِى ٱلسِّلْمِ كَآفَّةً وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, enter Islam completely and do not leave out any part of it like how the People of the Scripture believed in some parts of the book and disbelieved other parts. Do not follow the ways of Satan, because he has made it clear that he is your enemy."
"If you falter even after Our signs have reached you, then do not forget that God is all-powerful and all-wise.",208,2,فَإِن زَلَلْتُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْكُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"If you slip up or go astray after clear proofs have come to you, then know that Allah is Mighty in His ability and power, Wise in His planning and establishing of sacred laws. So, fear and glorify Him."
"Are they waiting for God to appear in the balconies of clouds with a host of angels, and the matter to be settled? But all things rest with God in the end.",209,2,هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّآ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِى ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْغَمَامِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَقُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"These people who follow the path of Satan, instead of the path of truth, are waiting only for Allah to come to them, as befits His majesty, on the Day of Resurrection in the shadows of clouds to judge them and for the angels to come and surround them from all sides. At that time, Allah will judge them once and for all. To Allah alone shall all affairs relating to creation return."
"Ask the children of Israel how many a clear sign We had given them. But if one changes the favour of God after having received it, then remember, God is severe in revenge.",210,2,سَلْ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ كَمْ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍۭ بَيِّنَةٍ وَمَن يُبَدِّلْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"O Prophet, ask the Jews about how many clear signs proving the truthfulness of the messengers were given to them by Allah. Despite this they disbelieved and turned away from them. If anyone changes the favour of Allah into disbelief and denial after being aware of it and after it has become obvious, then Allah is strong in punishing the disbelievers and the deniers."
"Enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world, and scoff at the faithful. But those who keep from evil and follow the straight path will have a higher place than they on the Day of Reckoning; for God gives in measure without number whomsoever He will.",211,2,زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"For those who disbelieve in Allah, the worldly life and its temporary pleasures and enjoyments have been made to seem glamorous. They mock at those who have faith in Allah and the Last Day. Those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and avoiding His prohibitions will be above such people in the Afterlife when Allah will make them live in the gardens of Paradise. Allah gives without any limit or account to whichever of His creation He wishes."
"Men belonged to a single community, and God sent them messengers to give them happy tidings and warnings, and sent the Book with them containing the truth to judge between them in matters of dispute; but only those who received it differed after receiving clear proofs, on account of waywardness (and jealousies) among them. Then God by His dispensation showed those who believed the way to the truth about which they were differing; for God shows whom He please the path that is straight.",212,2,كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَأَنزَلَ مَعَهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فِيمَا ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ فَهَدَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لِمَا ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"People were one community. All of them were in agreement and guided following the way of their father Adam, until the Satan misguided them. They were then split into believers and disbelievers. For this reason, God sent messengers bringing good news of the mercy of God for those who had faith in Him and followed Him and warning the disbelievers of the severe punishment of God. Together with the messengers, God also sent books containing the undoubtable truth so that they could judge between people with respect to their disagreements. It was only those who were given the Torah that differed with regards to the matter of Muhammad (s) and his message despite its being clear. They did this out of injustice and jealousy. God then enabled the believers to recognise guidance from misguidance by His permission and will. God guides whoever He wishes to a perfectly straight path which is the path of faith."
"Do you think you will find your way to Paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through? They had suffered affliction and loss, and were shaken and tossed about so that even the Apostle had to cry out with his followers: ""When will the help of God arrive?"" Remember, the help of God is ever at hand.",213,2,أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ ٱلْبَأْسَآءُ وَٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَلَآ إِنَّ نَصْرَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ,"Do you believers think that you will enter Paradise whilst you have not faced a trial like the people of the past? They were afflicted with severe sickness and poverty and were shaken by frightening events to the extent that they wanted the help of Allah to come as quick as possible; and the messenger and the believers with him began saying, ‘When is the help of Allah coming?’ The help of Allah is close to those that have faith and trust in Him."
"They ask you of what they should give in charity. Tell them: ""What you can spare of your wealth as should benefit the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the wayfarers, for God is not unaware of the good deeds that you do.""",214,2,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنفِقُونَ قُلْ مَآ أَنفَقْتُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبِينَ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِۦ عَلِيمٌ,"Your Companions, O Prophet, ask you what they should spend from their wealth and where they should allocate it. Say to them in reply: Any permissible and pure wealth you spend should be given to parents, close relatives in need, needy orphans, the poor who have no wealth and the traveller who is cut-off from his family and home. Allah knows of any good you do as believers, no matter how small. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will reward you for it."
"Enjoined on you is fighting, and this you abhor. You may dislike a thing yet it may be good for you; or a thing may haply please you but may be bad for you. Only God has knowledge, and you do not know.",215,2,كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰٓ أَن تَكْرَهُوا۟ شَيْـًٔا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰٓ أَن تُحِبُّوا۟ شَيْـًٔا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Fighting in Allah’s path has been chosen for believers even though it is something that is naturally disliked, because it means risking one’s life and wealth. However, you may dislike something when, it is good and beneficial. An example of this is striving in Allah’s path, which means – in addition to the great reward – the defeat of the enemy and promotion of Allah’s word. On the other hand, you may like something whilst it is bad and harmful to you, such as holding back from fighting: this will result in you being defeated and the enemy’s gaining authority over you. Allah knows full well what is good and what is not, whereas you do not. Therefore, follow His instruction which is better for you."
"They ask you of war in the holy month. Tell them: ""To fight in that month is a great sin. But a greater sin in the eyes of God is to hinder people from the way of God, and not to believe in Him, and to bar access to the Holy Mosque and turn people out of its precincts; and oppression is worse than killing. They will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith, if they can. But those of you who turn back on their faith and die disbelieving will have wasted their deeds in this world and the next. They are inmates of Hell, and shall there abide for ever.",216,2,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌۢ بِهِۦ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِۦ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلَا يَزَالُونَ يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِنِ ٱسْتَطَٰعُوا۟ وَمَن يَرْتَدِدْ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِۦ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"The people ask you, O Prophet, about the law regarding fighting in the sacred months of Dhū Al-Qa‘dah, Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram and Rajab. Say to them: Fighting in these months is a serious offence in the sight of Allah and is detested, just as the idolaters’ preventing from the path of Allah is also disapproved. Blocking the believers’ access to the Sacred Mosque and removing the people of the Sacred Mosque from it is worse than fighting in a sacred month in the sight of Allah. Their idolatry is worse than killing. The idolaters will continue their oppression by fighting you until they turn you away from your path of truth towards their false path, if they are able to. If anyone turns back from the path of Allah and dies disbelieving in Allah, his good actions shall be reduced to nothing and in the Afterlife he will end up in the fire of Hell, where he will live eternally."
"Surely those who believe, and those who leave their homes and fight in the way of God, may hope for His benevolence, for God is forgiving and kind.",217,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger, who leave their homes as emigrants towards Allah and His Messenger, and fight to promote Allah’s word are the ones who are eager for Allah’s mercy and forgiveness. Allah forgives the sins of His servants and is merciful towards them."
"They ask you of (intoxicants,) wine and gambling. Tell them: ""There is great enervation though profit in them for men; but their enervation is greater than benefit. And they ask you what they should give. Tell them: ""The utmost you can spare."" So does God reveal His signs: You may haply reflect",218,2,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ قُلْ فِيهِمَآ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَٰفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَإِثْمُهُمَآ أَكْبَرُ مِن نَّفْعِهِمَا وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنفِقُونَ قُلِ ٱلْعَفْوَ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"O Prophet! Your Companions ask you about wine (which refers to anything that impairs the mind or intoxicates it), with respect to the legal aspects of drinking, selling and purchasing it. They also ask you about gambling (which refers to wealth taken in a competition between two people in which both contribute to the winning total). Say in response to them: They both have many spiritual and material harms, such as loss of intellect and wealth and the creation of hatred and enmity. On the other hand, there are a few benefits, such as financial reward for the winner of a bet. However, the harm and sin resulting from them is greater than the benefit; so, a logical person should avoid such actions. This statement of Allah lays the foundation for the prohibition of wine. They also ask you, O Prophet, about the amount that they should spend in charity. Say in reply to them: Spend whatever is easy and in excess of your needs. With such clear explanations, Allah describes the sacred law to you so that you may reflect. Initially, this was the law regarding charity, but later Allah established the obligation of Zakat, which requires paying a set amount on certain possessions, if one has owned such possessions for a particular period of time."
"On this world and the next. And they ask you about the orphans. Tell them: ""Improving their lot is much better; and if you take interest in their affairs, they are your brethren; and God is aware who are corrupt and who are honest; and if He had pleased He could surely have imposed on you hardship, for God is all-powerful and all-wise.",219,2,فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ قُلْ إِصْلَاحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِن تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَٰنُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَأَعْنَتَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Allah has established these rules so that you may think about what benefits you in this world and the Afterlife. Your Companions ask you, O Prophet, about the guardianship of orphans and how they should deal with them: whether they can mix their wealth with that of the orphans for expenses, food and accommodation? Say in reply to them: If you are kind to them by arranging their affairs without taking anything in return and without touching their wealth, it is better in the sight of Allah and carries greater reward. It is also better because you will receive your full wealth. However, there is no harm if you mix their wealth with yours for living expenses, as they are your brothers in faith and it is normal for brothers to help and look after the affairs of one another. Allah knows the guardian who, by mixing the wealth of orphans with his, means harm and the one who means well. If He wished to make it difficult for you with respect to orphans, He would have done so. Instead, He has made it easy for you to deal with them as the sacred law is based on ease. Allah is Mighty and nothing can overpower Him. He is Wise in His planning and legislation."
"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him. They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace. And He makes His signs manifest that men may haply take heed.",220,2,وَلَا تَنكِحُوا۟ ٱلْمُشْرِكَٰتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ وَلَأَمَةٌ مُّؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ وَلَا تُنكِحُوا۟ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُوا۟ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِۦ وَيُبَيِّنُ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"Do not get married, O believers, to those women who give partners to Allah until they have faith in Him alone and enter the path of Islam. A woman who is a slave but has faith in Allah and His Messenger is better than a free woman who worships idols, even though you may be impressed by her beauty and wealth. Do not give Muslim women in marriage to men who are idolaters. A slave man who has faith in Allah and His Messenger is better than a free man who is an idolater, even though he may seem impressive to you. Men and women who commit idolatry, invite by their statements and actions, towards that which will lead to entering the fire of Hell. Allah, on the other hand, invites to good actions which will lead to entry into Paradise and forgiveness of sins by His permission and grace. Allah makes His verses clear for people so that they may learn and act obediently."
"They ask you about menstruation. Tell them: ""This is a period of stress. So keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it. When they are free of it, you may go to them as God has enjoined. For God loves those who seek pardon, and those who are clean.""",221,2,وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَٱعْتَزِلُوا۟ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فِى ٱلْمَحِيضِ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلتَّوَّٰبِينَ وَيُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ,"O Prophet! Your Companions ask you about menses (which is the blood of menstruation that naturally comes out of the womb at certain times of the month). Say in reply to them: Menses is harmful to the man and woman, so avoid sexual intercourse during this time. Do not approach them for sexual intercourse until the blood stops and they have cleaned themselves by taking a bath. If the blood has stopped and they have cleaned themselves, then you may have sexual intercourse with them through the vagina in the manner that Allah has permitted for you. Allah loves those that frequently repent from their sins and are extra mindful of cleanliness."
"Women are like fields for you; so seed them as you intend, but plan the future in advance. And fear God, and remember, you have to face Him in the end. So convey glad tidings to those who believe.",222,2,نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُوا۟ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ وَقَدِّمُوا۟ لِأَنفُسِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّكُم مُّلَٰقُوهُ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Your wives are a place for you to sow your seed: they produce children for you just as the land produces crops. So approach the plantation, which is the vagina, from whichever direction and in whichever manner you wish as long as intercourse takes place in the vagina. Send forth something good for yourselves, such as having sexual intercourse with the intention of gaining closeness to Allah and with the hope of pious offspring. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, such as those relating to women. Know that you are to meet Him on the Day of Resurrection and will have to stand before Him to receive the reward for your actions. O Prophet, give the believers good news of everlasting blessings that will surely please them when they meet their Lord: seeing His Blessed Face."
"Do not implicate God in your oaths to avoid doing good and being pious and keeping peace among men, for God hears all and knows everything.",223,2,وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لِّأَيْمَٰنِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ وَتُصْلِحُوا۟ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Do not use the name of Allah in your oath as an excuse for not doing good e.g. being mindful of Him, being virtuous, and reconciling between people. Yet if you have taken an oath not to do any good actions, then do good actions and make a compensation for the oath. Allah hears your statements and knows your actions and will reward you for them."
"God will not call you to account for that which is senseless in your oaths, but only for what is in your hearts; for God is forgiving and forbearing.",224,2,لَّا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغْوِ فِىٓ أَيْمَٰنِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"Allah will not take you to account for those oaths that you swear unintentionally, such as if someone carelessly says, ‘No, by Allah!’ or ‘Yes, by Allah!’ For such oaths there is no need to make any compensation, nor any further consequences. However, He will take you to account for intentional oaths. Allah forgives and tolerates the sins of His servants and is not hasty in sending punishment."
"Those who swear to keep away from their wives (with intent of divorcing them) have four months of grace; then if they reconcile (during this period), surely God is forgiving and kind.",225,2,لِّلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ فَإِن فَآءُو فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"For those who swear an oath not to have sexual intercourse with their wives, there is a waiting period not longer than four months, starting from the date of the oath. If he abandons the oath and engages in sexual intercourse after having sworn not to, and this happens within the four months period, then Allah forgives them. Allah is merciful and has established compensation as a way out from such an oath."
"And if they are bent on divorce, God hears all and knows everything.",226,2,وَإِنْ عَزَمُوا۟ ٱلطَّلَٰقَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"If such a man is determined to continue his oath and so passes the four months period, intending by that a divorce, then Allah hears their statements, including the divorce, and He knows their states and intentions and will reward them for that."
"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods, and if they believe in God and the Last Day they must not hide unlawfully what God has formed within their wombs. Their husbands would do well to take them back in that case, if they wish to be reconciled. Women also have recognised rights as men have, though men have an edge over them. But God is all-mighty and all-wise.",227,2,وَٱلْمُطَلَّقَٰتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَٰثَةَ قُرُوٓءٍ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِن كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوٓا۟ إِصْلَٰحًا وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ ٱلَّذِى عَلَيْهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Divorced women must not remarry after a divorce for three menstrual periods. If they are true in their faith in Allah and the Last Day, they may not hide the foetus that Allah has created in their wombs. Their husbands, who issued the divorce, have the first right to recall them during the waiting period if their intention is to live well with them and to cancel what has occurred because of the divorce. Wives have rights and obligations like those of husbands in a manner that people consider fair. Men have a higher rank than them in terms of responsibility and with respect to divorce. Allah is Mighty and nothing can overcome His decree. He is Wise in His legislation and planning."
"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself. Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors.",228,2,ٱلطَّلَٰقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌۢ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌۢ بِإِحْسَٰنٍ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُوا۟ مِمَّآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْـًٔا إِلَّآ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا ٱفْتَدَتْ بِهِۦ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"The divorce, after which a husband may recall his wife, can only happen twice. He may divorce her the first time, recall her, divorce her again and recall her once more. After two divorces he must either keep her in his marriage, living in a good way with her, or divorce her for the third time, being good to her by fulfilling her rights. Then the wife is temporarily prohibited for him until she marries another man (see Sūrah Al-Baqarah: 230, below). At the time of divorce, husbands may not take any part of the dowry that they had given their wives. However, if a woman is unhappy with her husband because of his character or looks, and the couple are of the view that, because of this, they will be not be able to fulfil the rights of marriage, then they should present the matter to a person related to them or someone who is familiar with them. If they feel that the couple will not be able to fulfil the rights of marriage, then there is no harm if the woman offers to give something to the husband in return for a divorce. These laws of the shariah are the criterion for the lawful and unlawful, so do not overstep them. Whoever oversteps the limits of Allah with regards to the lawful and the unlawful, then such people are wronging their own selves by bringing them to destruction and exposing them to Allah’s anger and justice."
"If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man. Then if he divorces her there is no harm if the two unite again if they think they will keep within the bounds set by God and made clear for those who understand.",229,2,فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُۥ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"If the husband divorces her for the third time, he may not remarry her until she gets married to another man in a valid marriage that is genuine and not merely contracted to make her lawful for the original husband, and where sexual intercourse has taken place in this later marriage. Should the second husband divorce her or pass away, the woman and her first husband may return to one another with a new marriage contract and dowry, if they feel that they will fulfil the rights of each other set-out in the sacred law. These rules are made clear by Allah for people who know His laws and limits, as they are the ones who benefit from them."
"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress. He who does so will wrong himself. Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong. Have fear of God, and remember, God is cognisant of everything.",230,2,وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ سَرِّحُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَلَا تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لِّتَعْتَدُوا۟ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُۥ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوٓا۟ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ هُزُوًا وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَٱلْحِكْمَةِ يَعِظُكُم بِهِۦ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"When you divorce women and they approach the end of their waiting period, you have the right to take them back or to leave them in a good way until their waiting period is over. Do not take them back in order to oppress and harm them, as was the practice in the period before Islam. Whoever acts with the aim of causing harm to them has wronged himself by exposing himself to sin and punishment. Do not make Allah’s words the object of mockery and play. Remember Allah’s favours on you: most importantly, the revelation you have received in the form of the Qur’ān and Sunnah, through which He reminds you to encourage and warn you. Fear Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Know that Allah knows everything and that nothing is hidden from Him. He will reward you for your actions."
"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably. This warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day. This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know.",231,2,وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَن يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَٰجَهُنَّ إِذَا تَرَٰضَوْا۟ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ ذَٰلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِۦ مَن كَانَ مِنكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"When you divorce women less than three times and their waiting period ends, do not stop them from returning to their husbands with a new marriage contract if they wish to do so and they agree with their husbands. This law prohibiting them from being prevented is a piece of advice for that person who has faith in Allah and the Last Day. If you obey, this will bring greater good to you, and keep your honour and actions free of impurities. Allah knows the reality and outcome of matters, whereas you do not."
"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring. The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies). If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm. And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary. But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.",232,2,وَٱلْوَٰلِدَٰتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَٰدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ ٱلرَّضَاعَةَ وَعَلَى ٱلْمَوْلُودِ لَهُۥ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا لَا تُضَآرَّ وَٰلِدَةٌۢ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُۥ بِوَلَدِهِۦ وَعَلَى ٱلْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَٰلِكَ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُوٓا۟ أَوْلَٰدَكُمْ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّآ ءَاتَيْتُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Mothers who intend to complete the period of breastfeeding should nurse their children for two full years. The husband and father of a child is responsible for the maintenance and clothing of a divorced mother who breast feeds her child in accordance with the customs of society that do not go against the sacred law. No person is burdened beyond what he is able to do. No parent is allowed to use the child as a means to harm the other. The heir (who would inherit from the child if the child were to pass away leaving behind wealth) shall be responsible, if the father dies without leaving any wealth, for the same obligations as that of the father. If the parents decide to wean the child before two years finish, then there is no sin on them, if this is done after full consultation and agreement that it is in the child’s best interests. If you wish to hire wet-nurses for your children instead of their mothers, there is no sin in doing so provided you pay the agreed wages of such wet-nurses without any shortfall or delay. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, and know that Allah sees everything you do and nothing is hidden from Him. He will reward you for any action you do."
"Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands death) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably, for God is aware of all that you do.",233,2,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَٰجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"When someone passes away and leaves behind a wife who is not pregnant, it is the duty of such a woman to wait for a period of four months and ten days, in which she must not leave the husband’s home, beautify herself or get married. Once this period ends, there is no blame on their guardians if these women do these actions, which were previously prohibited during the waiting period, as long as it is done in a manner acceptable to society and the sacred law. Allah is well aware of what you do. None of your private or public actions are concealed from Him; and He will reward you for them."
"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing.",234,2,وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُم بِهِۦ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرًّا إِلَّآ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا وَلَا تَعْزِمُوا۟ عُقْدَةَ ٱلنِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ أَجَلَهُۥ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"There is no sin on you if you hint to your desire to propose to a woman who is still in her waiting period after a divorce or after the death of her husband. For example, a person may say, ‘When your waiting period is over, let me know’. There is also no sin on you if you keep this desire to yourselves. Allah knows that you will mention them because of your strong desire to marry, so He has allowed you to give a hint without being open. Beware of secretly making any promise to marry them whilst they are still in their waiting period. However, you may give a hint to them in the manner that is acceptable; but do not confirm the marriage contract in the period of waiting. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so be mindful of Him and do not go against His instruction. Know that Allah Forgiving to the person who repents to Him; and that He is tolerant and does not often quickly punish."
"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.",235,2,لَّا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُوا۟ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى ٱلْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُۥ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُۥ مَتَٰعًۢا بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"There is no sin on you if you divorce your wives with whom you have entered into marriage before you have sexual intercourse with them and before you fix a dowry for them. If you must divorce them in such a situation, they will not be entitled to any dowry from you; but they must be given something that they will enjoy, to make it easy on their feelings. This must be done by both a rich and a poor man according to their means. This gift is binding on those who wish to do good in their actions and dealings."
"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount. And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety. But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do.",236,2,وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلَّآ أَن يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَا۟ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِۦ عُقْدَةُ ٱلنِّكَاحِ وَأَن تَعْفُوٓا۟ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلَا تَنسَوُا۟ ٱلْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"If you divorce your wives with whom you have entered into marriage before having sexual intercourse with them and you had fixed the amount of the dowry, you will have to pay half of this amount to them, unless they give up this right of theirs or the husband wishes to pay the full dowry. To give up your right is closer to Mindfulness. Do not forget to show kindness and compassion to one another in matters of rights. Allah sees what you do, so try to do what is best to earn His reward."
"Be wakeful of your service of prayer, and the midmost service; and honour God by standing before Him in devotion.",237,2,حَٰفِظُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَٰتِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ ٱلْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا۟ لِلَّهِ قَٰنِتِينَ,"Guard your prayers by fulfilling them completely as Allah has instructed. In particular, guard the middle prayer, which is the ‘aṣr (afternoon) prayer; and stand before Allah in submission and devotion."
"If you fear (war or danger), pray while standing or on horseback; but when you have safety again remember God, for He taught you what you did not know.",238,2,فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالًا أَوْ رُكْبَانًا فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُوا۟ تَعْلَمُونَ,"If you face danger from an enemy or any other danger, and you are not able to offer the prayer completely, then pray whilst walking or riding, on camels, horses, or in any way you can. If the danger has gone, remember Allah as He has taught you: remembering Him in the most complete manner within the prayer. Also, remember Him for His having taught you guidance and given you light which you were previously unaware of."
"Those among you about to die leaving wives behind, should bequeath a year's maintenance and lodging for them, without expelling them from home. But if they leave (of their own accord), you will not be blamed for what they do with themselves in their own rights. God is all-mighty and all-wise.",239,2,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَٰجًا وَصِيَّةً لِّأَزْوَٰجِهِم مَّتَٰعًا إِلَى ٱلْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى مَا فَعَلْنَ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Those of you that pass away leaving behind wives must make a bequest for them to be provided with accommodation and maintenance for a period of one year in which your heirs may not remove them. This is to make up for the loss they have suffered and in respect for the deceased. If they leave before the end of the year by their own choice, there will be no sin on either you or them for what they do with themselves in terms of their beautification. Allah is Mighty and none can overpower Him. He is Wise in His planning and legislation. It should be noted that most commentators are of the view that the law contained in this verse has been abrogated by the verse: ‘When someone passes away and leaves behind a wife who is not pregnant, it is the duty of these women to wait for a period of four months and ten days...’ [ Sūrah Al-Baqarah: 234]."
Making a fair provision for women who are divorced is the duty of those who are God-fearing and pious.,240,2,وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَٰتِ مَتَٰعٌۢ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Divorced women should be gifted something of clothing, money etc. This is to make-up for their emotional suffering because of the divorce. Such provision must be in keeping with the financial position of the husband; and it is a duty on those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
So does God pronounce His decrees that you may understand.,241,2,كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"As with the previous explanation, Allah explains these verses – containing His limits and laws – to the believers so that they understand and practice them, and so achieve the good of this world and the Afterlife."
"Have you never thought of men who went out of their homes as a measure of safety against death, and they were thousands, to whom God said: ""Die,"" then restored them to life? Indeed God bestows His blessings on men; only most men are not grateful.",242,2,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مُوتُوا۟ ثُمَّ أَحْيَٰهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"Do you not know, O Prophet, about those who left their homes in huge numbers fearing death due to the plague or something similar? This refers to a group of people from the Israelites. Allah said to them, ‘Die!’ and they did. Then Allah brought them back to life to show them that everything is in His Hands and that they have no control over any benefit or harm. Allah is Gracious and Bountiful to people, but most people are ungrateful for His favours."
"Fight in the way of God, and remember that God hears all and knows everything.",243,2,وَقَٰتِلُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Fight, O believers, the enemies of Allah: in support of His path and to promote His Word. Know that Allah hears your statements and knows your intentions and actions, and that He will reward you for them."
"Who will give a goodly loan to God which He might double many times? For God withholds and enlarges, and to Him you will return.",244,2,مَّن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يُقْرِضُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَٰعِفَهُۥ لَهُۥٓ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْصُۜطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Who will act as a lender and spend his wealth in the path of Allah, willingly with a good intention so that this may come back to him multiplied? Allah restricts and widens provision and health in accordance with His wisdom and justice. In the Afterlife, you will return to Him alone and He will give you a reward for your actions."
"Have you thought of the elders of Israel after Moses, and how they said to their apostle: ""Set up a king for us, then we shall fight in the way of God?"" He replied: ""This too is possible that when commanded to fight you may not fight at all."" They said: ""How is it we should not fight in the way of God when we have been driven from our homes and deprived of our Sons?"" But when they were ordered to fight they turned away, except for a few; yet God knows the sinners.",245,2,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلَإِ مِنۢ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰٓ إِذْ قَالُوا۟ لِنَبِىٍّ لَّهُمُ ٱبْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكًا نُّقَٰتِلْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ أَلَّا تُقَٰتِلُوا۟ قَالُوا۟ وَمَا لَنَآ أَلَّا نُقَٰتِلَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِن دِيَٰرِنَا وَأَبْنَآئِنَا فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْا۟ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Do you not know, O Prophet, about those nobles from the Israelites after the time of Moses who said to a prophet of theirs, ‘Set up for us a king and we will fight alongside him in Allah’s path’? The prophet replied, ‘It may be that if Allah makes fighting obligatory, you will not fight!’ They denied that this would happen and insisted, ‘What would stop us from fighting in Allah’s path when our enemies have removed us from our homes and have taken our children as prisoners?’ Yet when Allah made fighting obligatory on them, they all turned away, except a few of them. Allah knows the wrongdoers who broke their promise and turned away from His instruction; and He will repay them for their action."
"And when their prophet said to them: ""God has raised Saul king over you,"" they said: ""How can he be king over us when we have greater right to kingship than he, for he does not even possess abundant wealth?"" ""God has chosen him in preference to you,"" said the prophet ""and given him much more wisdom and prowess; and God gives authority to whomsoever He will: God is infinite and all-wise.""",246,2,وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا قَالُوٓا۟ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِٱلْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلْمَالِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَزَادَهُۥ بَسْطَةً فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ وَٱلْجِسْمِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤْتِى مُلْكَهُۥ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Their prophet said to them, ‘Allah has appointed Saul as your king, under whose banner you must fight’. Their leaders objected to this appointment and said, ‘How can he rule over us when we have a greater right to rule than he does, since he is not from the children of kings and he has not been given vast wealth which he can use in his rule!’ Their prophet said to them, ‘Allah has selected him over you and has given him great knowledge and physical strength. Allah grants authority to whomever He wishes in accordance with His wisdom and mercy. Allah is Bountiful and grants to whomever He wishes. He knows which of His creation is most deserving’."
"Their prophet said to them: ""The sign of his kingship will be that you will come to have a heart full of peace and tranquility from your Lord and the legacy left by Moses' and Aaron's family supported by angels. This shall be a token for you if you really believe.""",247,2,وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ ءَايَةَ مُلْكِهِۦٓ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلتَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ءَالُ مُوسَىٰ وَءَالُ هَٰرُونَ تَحْمِلُهُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Their prophet said to them that the mark of his being truly chosen as their king was that Allah would return to them the Ark. This was a chest revered by the Israelites which was taken away from them. In it there was tranquillity and relics left behind by the family of Moses and Aaron, such as the staff and a few tablets. In that there is a clear sign if you are true believers."
"When Saul led his armies, he said: ""God will test you by a stream. Whoever drinks its water will not be of me; but those who do not drink shall be on my side. The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands."" And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: ""We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: ""Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere).""",248,2,فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِٱلْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُم بِنَهَرٍ فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّى وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُۥ مِنِّىٓ إِلَّا مَنِ ٱغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةًۢ بِيَدِهِۦ فَشَرِبُوا۟ مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنْهُمْ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُۥ هُوَ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ قَالُوا۟ لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِۦ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُوا۟ ٱللَّهِ كَم مِّن فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةًۢ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"When Saul set out with his warriors, he said to them, ‘Allah will test you with a river. If anyone drinks from it, he will not be on my path and must not join me in fighting. The person who does not drink from it will be on my path and will join me in the fight. If someone drinks a handful of water, this will be forgiven’. When they reached the river, all the warriors drank from its water, except a few of them who held back despite being extremely thirsty. After Saul had crossed the river with the believers, some of the warriors said, ‘We do not have the ability to fight Goliath and his army’. Those that were convinced that they would meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection said to them, ‘So many believing groups small in number have defeated a disbelieving group large in number with Allah’s permission and assistance. Victory is based on faith and not numbers. Allah is with the patient ones among His servants: He assists and gives them victory’."
"And when they were facing Goliath and his hordes they prayed: ""O Lord, give us endurance and steady our steps, and help us against the deniers of truth.""",249,2,وَلَمَّا بَرَزُوا۟ لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِۦ قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"When they came out to face Goliath and his army, they prayed to Allah, saying: Our Lord, grant us patience in our hearts, make our feet firm so that we do not flee or lose courage before our enemies, and give us Your assistance and support against the disbelieving people."
"By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased. If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved. But gracious is God to the people of the world.",250,2,فَهَزَمُوهُم بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتَلَ دَاوُۥدُ جَالُوتَ وَءَاتَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَهُۥ مِمَّا يَشَآءُ وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّفَسَدَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"They defeated them by God’s will. The prophet of God, David, killed their leader Goliath and God gave him kingship and prophethood and taught him many sciences as He willed, including those that are beneficial for this world and those for the hearafter. If it were not the system of God to drive back the evil of some people by means of others, there would be corruption on earth as the evil ones would gain authority. However, God is Bountiful to all of His creation."
"These are the messages of God. We recite them to you in all truth, as indeed you are one of the apostles.",251,2,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Those are the clear verses of Allah which are recited to you, O Prophet, and they contain true stories and just laws. You are one of the messengers of the Lord of the Worlds."
"Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others. God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others. And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them. But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied. And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves. But God does whatsoever He please.",252,2,تِلْكَ ٱلرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُم مَّن كَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَٰتٍ وَءَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَأَيَّدْنَٰهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ وَلَٰكِنِ ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ ءَامَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلُوا۟ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ,"Allah favoured some of those messengers mentioned to you over others with respect to their revelation, followers and ranks. Some of them Allah spoke to, such as Moses, and others He granted a high rank, such as Muhammad (peace be upon him) – who was sent to the entire humankind as the last of the prophets and whose nation was preferred over all other communities. Allah gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear miracles confirming his prophethood, such as bringing the dead to life and curing the leper and the blind; and supported him with the angel Gabriel to give him strength in fulfilling Allah’s instruction. If Allah had willed, those that came after the messengers would not have fought amongst themselves after having received clear signs; but they disagreed and were divided. Some of them had faith in Allah, whilst others did not. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought with each other; but Allah does as He wills: He guides whomever He wills to faith through His mercy and grace, and He does not guide whomever He wishes by His justice and wisdom."
"O believers, expend of what We have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter, and no friendship or intercession matter, and those who are disbelievers will be sinners.",253,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, spend from the different types of permissible wealth that Allah has provided for you before the Day of Resurrection comes. On that day, there will be no sale so that a person may buy something of use to him, nor friendship that will be of benefit at a time of difficulty, and no intermediary that will protect him from any harm or bring any benefit unless Allah allows. The disbelievers are in the wrong due to their denial of Allah."
"God: There is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining. Neither does somnolence affect Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: and who can intercede with Him except by His leave? Known to Him is all that is present before men and what is hidden (in time past and time future), and not even a little of His knowledge can they grasp except what He will. His seat extends over heavens and the earth, and He tires not protecting them: He alone is all high and supreme.",254,2,ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْحَىُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ لَا تَأْخُذُهُۥ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ لَّهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَىْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِۦٓ إِلَّا بِمَا شَآءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَلَا يَـُٔودُهُۥ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Allah is the One Who alone deserves to be worshipped. He is the One who lives perfectly without any death or deficiency. He exists by Himself and is not in need of any of His creation. The creation only exists through Him and is always in need of Him. Drowsiness or sleep does not come upon Him due to the perfection of His life and existence. He alone controls the heavens and the earth. No one can intercede before Him without His acceptance and permission. He knows what has happened in the past and what will happen in the future. The creation has no share in His knowledge unless He wills to grant them some of it. His Throne covers the vastness of the heavens and the earth. It is not difficult for Him to preserve the heaven and the earth. He is High in His essence and attributes and Great in His dominion and authority.
"There is no compulsion in matter of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error. He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything.",255,2,لَآ إِكْرَاهَ فِى ٱلدِّينِ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ ٱلرُّشْدُ مِنَ ٱلْغَىِّ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلطَّٰغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ لَا ٱنفِصَامَ لَهَا وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"No one is forced to enter the religion of Islam, as it is clearly the true religion and there is no need to force anyone to believe in it. Truth stands clear from falsehood. Whoever rejects all those things that are worshipped besides Allah and frees himself from them, and has faith in Allah alone, has held on to the strongest rope for salvation on the Day of Resurrection and which will never break. Allah hears the statements of His servants, knows their actions and will reward them accordingly."
"God is the friend of those who believe, and leads them out of darkness into light; but the patrons of infidels are idols and devils who lead them from light into darkness. They are the residents of Hell, and will there for ever abide.",256,2,ٱللَّهُ وَلِىُّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ ٱلطَّٰغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ ٱلنُّورِ إِلَى ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"God takes care of those who have faith in Him. He grants them success and victory and takes them out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. The friends of the disbelievers are Satan and his assistants who make disbelief seem beautiful to them and who take them from the light of faith and knowledge into the darkness of disbelief and ignorance. They are the people of the Fire who will remain there forever. Allah takes care of those who have faith in Him: He gives them success and victory and takes them out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. The friends of the disbelievers are Satan and his assistants who make disbelief seem beautiful to them, and who take them from the light of faith and knowledge into the darkness of disbelief and ignorance. They are the people of the fire of Hell who will live there eternally."
"Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: ""My Lord is the giver of life and death,"" he replied: ""I am the giver of life and death."" And Abraham said: ""God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,"" and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust.",257,2,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَٰهِۦمَ فِى رَبِّهِۦٓ أَنْ ءَاتَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ رَبِّىَ ٱلَّذِى يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا۠ أُحْىِۦ وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِٱلشَّمْسِ مِنَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ ٱلْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ ٱلَّذِى كَفَرَ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Prophet, do you know about the arrogance of the rebellious one who argued with Abraham about Allah’s Lordship and Oneness? This happened because Allah had given him the power to rule, yet he transgressed and took advantage of his position. Abraham explained to him the attributes of his Lord by saying, ‘My Lord is the One Who gives life to the creation and causes them to die’. The rebel stubbornly said, ‘I too can give life and cause death. I can kill whomever I wish and pardon whomever I wish’. Abraham then put forward another stronger argument by saying to him, ‘The Lord I worship is the One Who brings the sun from the direction of the east; so, you should bring it from the direction of west!’ The rebel was shocked and defeated by this strong argument. Allah does not allow wrongdoers to be guided and traverse His Path because of their disobedience and rebellion."
"Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down. He said: ""How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?"" So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: ""How long did you stay in this state?"" ""A day or less than a day,"" he replied. ""No,"" He said, ""you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh."" When this became clear to him, the man said: ""Indeed God has power over all things.""",258,2,أَوْ كَٱلَّذِى مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْىِۦ هَٰذِهِ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا فَأَمَاتَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِا۟ئَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُۥ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِا۟ئَةَ عَامٍ فَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ وَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ ءَايَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱنظُرْ إِلَى ٱلْعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُۥ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Or do you know the example of the one who passed by a town in which the roofs had fallen, the walls had collapsed and the people had died, making it a deserted ruin? This man said in surprise, ‘How will Allah ever bring these people back to life?’ Allah then caused him to die for a period of one hundred years and then brought him back to life and asked him, ‘How long were you dead for?’ He replied, ‘I remained like that for one day or less than a day’. Allah then said to him, ‘Actually, you were like that for one hundred years. Look at the food you had with you, which has not gone bad in spite of this long period! Look at your dead donkey! I want to make you a clear sign for showing people the power I have to bring them back to life. Look at the bones of the donkey that are scattered. I will lift them, put them together, clothe them with flesh and then give them life again’. When he saw this, the reality became clear to him and he realized the power of Allah, and said in respect, ‘I know that Allah has power over everything’."
"Remember, when Abraham said: ""O Lord, show me how you raise the dead,"" He said: ""What! Do you not believe?"" ""I do,"" answered Abraham. ""I only ask for my heart's assurance."" (The Lord) said: ""Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you. Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise.""",259,2,وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِۦمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ ٱجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِّنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ٱدْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْيًا وَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"O Prophet, remember when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, show me how the dead come back to life’. Allah said to him, ‘Do you not have faith in this?’ Abraham replied, ‘I do have faith, but I just want to put my heart at ease’. So, Allah instructed him, saying, ‘Take four birds and tame them. Then cut them up into pieces and place a piece of each bird on the hills around you. Then call those birds and you will see that they will come quickly to you, having been brought back to life. Know, O Abraham, that Allah is Mighty in His dominion and Wise in His instruction and legislation’."
"The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise.",260,2,مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنۢبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِى كُلِّ سُنۢبُلَةٍ مِّا۟ئَةُ حَبَّةٍ وَٱللَّهُ يُضَٰعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"The example of the reward of the believers who spend their wealth in Allah’s path is like that of a grain that is planted by a farmer in fertile ground. This grain then produces seven spikes, each carrying a hundred grains. Allah multiplies the reward for whomever of His servants He wishes and gives them their reward without account. Allah is Bountiful and Giving and He knows who deserves to have their reward multiplied."
"Those who spend in the way of God, and having spent do not boast or give pain (by word or deed), will get their reward from their Lord, and will neither have fear nor regret.",261,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ لَا يُتْبِعُونَ مَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ مَنًّا وَلَآ أَذًى لَّهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Those who spend their wealth for Allah’s obedience and pleasure, and do not destroy their reward afterwards by reminding people of their favour by their words or actions, will receive their reward from their Lord. They will have no fear for the future nor any grief over the past because of the great bounties they will be enjoying."
"Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind.",262,2,قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى وَٱللَّهُ غَنِىٌّ حَلِيمٌ,"A kind word that makes a believer happy or forgiveness of the one who is ill-mannered is better than charity followed by harm caused by reminding the person of the favour. Allah is in no need of His servants; and because He is tolerant with them, He does not often quickly punish."
"O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day. His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare. So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe.",263,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُبْطِلُوا۟ صَدَقَٰتِكُم بِٱلْمَنِّ وَٱلْأَذَىٰ كَٱلَّذِى يُنفِقُ مَالَهُۥ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ فَمَثَلُهُۥ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُۥ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُۥ صَلْدًا لَّا يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not ruin the reward of your charity by boasting about it and hurting the person to whom you gave it. A person who does this is like one who spends to be seen and praised by people, and does not have faith in Allah and in the reward and punishment on the Day of Resurrection. This is like a smooth stone on which there is some dust: when heavy rain falls onto it, the dust is washed away and the stone is left smooth with nothing on it. Similarly, the reward of the actions and charity of those who show off does not remain in the sight of Allah. Allah does not guide disbelievers to what pleases Him and benefits them in their actions and spending."
"But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do.",264,2,وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍۭ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَـَٔاتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِن لَّمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"The example of believers who spend their wealth seeking Allah’s pleasure, with firm conviction in their hearts of Allah’s promise, is like that of a garden on high fertile ground on which heavy rain falls and causes it to produce double its crop. In addition, if it does not receive heavy rain then the light rain that falls on it is sufficient because the land is fertile. In the same way, the little that is spent by the sincere ones is accepted by Allah and its reward is multiplied. Allah sees what you do: He knows who is sincere and who is not, and will reward each one accordingly."
"Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect.",265,2,أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُۥ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ لَهُۥ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ وَأَصَابَهُ ٱلْكِبَرُ وَلَهُۥ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَٱحْتَرَقَتْ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"Do any of you wish to have a garden with date-palms and grapevines through which sweet waters flow and which has all kinds of wholesome fruit? When the owner of the garden becomes old and is no longer able to work and earn, and he has weak young children who also cannot work, a strong fiery wind strikes this garden and it burns down completely at a time when he is most in need of it because of his old age and for his weak young children. The condition of a person who spends his wealth to show people is like that of this man: when he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will have no good actions at a time when he will be most in need of them. In this manner, Allah explains to you what will be of benefit to you in this world and the next, so that you may reflect."
"O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy.",266,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَنفِقُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا تَيَمَّمُوا۟ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُم بِـَٔاخِذِيهِ إِلَّآ أَن تُغْمِضُوا۟ فِيهِ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, spend from the pure, wholesome wealth that you have earned and from the produce that we have taken out for you from the ground. Do not look for that which is inferior to spend, because if it was given to you, you would not take it willingly because of its poor quality. How, then, can you be satisfied with offering Allah that which you would not accept for yourselves? Know that Allah is no need of your spending and He is praised in His essence and actions."
"Satan threatens you with want, and orders you (to commit) shameful acts. But God promises His pardon and grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing.",267,2,ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱلْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلًا وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Satan makes you afraid of poverty by encouraging you to be stingy, and he invites you to commit sins. Allah, on the other hand, promises you forgiveness for your sins and much provision. Allah is very bountiful and He knows the condition of His servants."
He gives wisdom to whomsoever He please; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance. Yet none remembers this save men of wisdom.,268,2,يُؤْتِى ٱلْحِكْمَةَ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُؤْتَ ٱلْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِىَ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّآ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"Allah grants the ability to whomever of His servants He wishes to be steadfast in their statements and actions. Anyone who is given this ability has been given much good. However, only those with sound minds, that seek enlightenment through His light, and guidance from His guidance, will pay attention and benefit from the signs of Allah."
"Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them.",269,2,وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُم مِّن نَّفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُم مِّن نَّذْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُۥ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ,"Whatever you spend, no matter how little, for the pleasure of Allah, or any action that you promise to do for Allah without having been required to do it, Allah knows of it and it will not be lost. He will give you a great reward for it. Those who do wrong by not fulfilling their obligations and overstepping Allah’s limits have no one to protect them against the punishment on the Day of Resurrection."
"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do.",270,2,إِن تُبْدُوا۟ ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِىَ وَإِن تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا ٱلْفُقَرَآءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنكُم مِّن سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"If you openly declare what you spend in charity, it is a good act. But if you keep it secret and give it to the poor in private, this is better as it indicates sincerity. Charity that is given sincerely becomes the means of sins being covered up and forgiven. Allah knows what you do and nothing from your circumstances is hidden from Him."
"It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you.",271,2,لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَىٰهُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِأَنفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنفِقُونَ إِلَّا ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تُظْلَمُونَ,"O Prophet, you are not responsible for making them believe in the truth and submitting to it: your duty is to guide them to the truth and explain it to them. It is only Allah Who can bring them to the truth; and He guides whomever He wishes. The benefit of any good you spend comes back to you; Allah is in no need of it. So, let your spending be only for Allah’s sake: true believers spend only for Allah’s pleasure. You will receive the full reward for any good you spend, no matter how little, because Allah does not wrong anyone."
"(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend.",272,2,لِلْفُقَرَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُحْصِرُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ ٱلْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ ٱلتَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَٰهُمْ لَا يَسْـَٔلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِۦ عَلِيمٌ,"You should spend on those poor people who, because they are busy striving in Allah’s path, are unable to travel to earn a living. Due to their not asking, a person that is unaware will think that they are not in need. However, the person who knows will recognise them by the signs that are apparent on their body and clothing. They are unlike other poor persons who beg persistently. Allah knows of any good or wealth you spend and He will give you a great reward for it."
"Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret.",273,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُم بِٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Those who spend their wealth for Allah’s sake at night and during the day, secretly and openly, without showing off or looking for fame, will have their reward from their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. As a favour and blessing from Allah, they will have no fear of what the future holds, nor any sadness over what they missed out on in the world."
"Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever.",274,2,ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلرِّبَوٰا۟ لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ ٱلَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ مِنَ ٱلْمَسِّ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا ٱلْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ ٱلرِّبَوٰا۟ وَأَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ ٱلرِّبَوٰا۟ فَمَن جَآءَهُۥ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ فَٱنتَهَىٰ فَلَهُۥ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Those who take interest will rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection like a person who is afflicted by Satan: they will stand up from their graves and then fall like a person who is epileptic. This is because they made usury permissible and made no distinction between usury and that which Allah has permitted in terms of profit earned through sales transactions. They claimed, ‘Sale is like usury’, meaning that both are lawful since both lead to an increase in wealth. Allah refutes their comparison and explains that He has permitted sale because of the general and specific benefit it contains, and He has prohibited usury because it is oppressive and abusive of people’s wealth. The person who stops taking usury, and repents from his sin, after receiving Allah’s instruction prohibiting it and warning him against it, may keep the usury that he received in the past, without any sin. Then, whatever he does from then on, Allah will judge it. Whoever returns to taking usury after knowing of the prohibition deserves to enter the fire of Hell and to remain there eternally. The reference to remaining in the fire of Hell eternally in relation to those that believe in Allah’s Oneness is an indication of a long period of time; for only disbelievers will actually remain eternally in the fire of Hell."
"God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners.",275,2,يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَوٰا۟ وَيُرْبِى ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ,"Allah wipes out usury either by actually destroying it or by removing His blessing. Yet He increases charity and makes it grow by multiplying its reward by ten times up to seven hundred times or even more, and blesses those that give charity from their wealth. Allah does not love a stubborn disbeliever who considers the prohibited as lawful and persists in sins."
"Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret.",276,2,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَوُا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Those who have faith in Allah, follow His Messenger, do good actions, fulfil their prayers in a complete manner and give Zakat to those deserving it, they shall receive their reward from their Lord and shall not have any fear for their future nor any grief over anything they missed in the worldly life."
"O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe.",277,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَذَرُوا۟ مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ ٱلرِّبَوٰٓا۟ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, fear Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, and do not demand any usury owed to you that remains with people, if you truly have faith in Allah and in His prohibitions."
"If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle. But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you.",278,2,فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا۟ فَأْذَنُوا۟ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَإِن تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ,"If you do not obey the sacred law, then be aware and certain of war with Allah and His Messenger. If you repent to Allah and leave usury, then you can keep the initial amount that you had given as a loan from your capital, in a manner that does not wrong anyone by taking more than your initial capital and does not wrong you by making you receive less than it."
"If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand.",279,2,وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُوا۟ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"If the person from whom you demand your debt is in hard times and is unable to repay the debt, then refrain from asking until he is able to obtain money and then pay the debt. And to give charity to him by not demanding the debt or giving up a part of it is better for you, if you knew its worth in the sight of Allah."
"Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged.",280,2,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,Fear the punishment of a day in which you all will be returned to Allah and you will have to stand before Him. Then every person will be given the reward of any good or evil action he did. They will not be wronged by receiving a reward less than their good actions or a punishment more than their evil actions.
"O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything.",281,2,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا تَدَايَنتُم بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَٱكْتُبُوهُ وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌۢ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ ٱلَّذِى عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُۥ وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْـًٔا فَإِن كَانَ ٱلَّذِى عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا أَوْ ضَعِيفًا أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُۥ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱسْتَشْهِدُوا۟ شَهِيدَيْنِ مِن رِّجَالِكُمْ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَٱمْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءِ أَن تَضِلَّ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا ٱلْأُخْرَىٰ وَلَا يَأْبَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُوا۟ وَلَا تَسْـَٔمُوٓا۟ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلِهِۦ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَٰدَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰٓ أَلَّا تَرْتَابُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلَّا تَكْتُبُوهَا وَأَشْهِدُوٓا۟ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ وَلَا يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلَا شَهِيدٌ وَإِن تَفْعَلُوا۟ فَإِنَّهُۥ فُسُوقٌۢ بِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, when you enter a transaction that involves a debt – such as when you give a loan to one another for a fixed period –then write it down. The person who is able to write should write it down fairly and in accordance with the sacred law, and should not refuse to write down the debt in accordance with what Allah has taught him about writing justly. He should write what is dictated by the person against whom the right is so that it serves as an acknowledgement from him. He should be mindful of Allah and not reduce anything from the value or description of the debt. If the debtor is not experienced in undertaking transactions, young, insane or is not able to dictate due to being mute or for some other reason, then his authoritative guardian should dictate with fairness. Also, call two sane and upright men as witnesses. If two men are not found, then call one man and two women whose religion and honesty you are satisfied with, so that if one of the women forgets, the other can remind her. The witness should not refuse to be a witness to a debt and must testify if required. Do not be lazy to write down the debt, no matter how small the amount, as this is more just in Allah’s law, more reliable as evidence and more likely to remove any doubt in the type, amount or period of the debt. However, if the transaction is for an item that is present in exchange for a spot price there is no harm in not writing down, since there is no need to do so. Calling witnesses is legislated so that disputes do not arise. It is unlawful to cause any harm to the witnesses or the ones who write; nor may they cause any harm to those who request them to write or stand witness. If anyone causes harm, he is going against Allah’s sacred law. O people of faith, be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Allah will teach you what is best for you in this world and the Afterlife. Allah knows everything and nothing is hidden from Him."
"If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do.",282,2,وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُوا۟ كَاتِبًا فَرِهَٰنٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ ٱلَّذِى ٱؤْتُمِنَ أَمَٰنَتَهُۥ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُۥ وَلَا تَكْتُمُوا۟ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُۥٓ ءَاثِمٌ قَلْبُهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"If you are travelling and do not find anyone who can write down the debt for you, then the debtor can give a property to the creditor as a security for his right until the debt is paid. If you trust one another, it is not necessary to write the debt down, call witnesses or give a promise. In such cases, the debt will be the responsibility of the debtor, which he must fulfil and be mindful of Allah regarding it by not denying it later. If he later denies it, then the person who was present at the time of the transaction must give evidence and may not hide it. If anyone should hide evidence, it indicates that his heart is sinful. Allah knows what you do, nothing is hidden from Him and He will reward you for your actions."
"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things.",283,2,لِّلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُوا۟ مَا فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُم بِهِ ٱللَّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"To Allah belongs everything that is in the heavens and earth: He created, owns and controls all of it. Whether you show or hide what is in your hearts, Allah knows about it and will call you to account for it. Then He will forgive whomever He wishes out of His grace and mercy, and He will punish whomever He wishes out of His wisdom and justice. Allah is able to do all things."
"The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles. For they say: ""We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end.""",284,2,ءَامَنَ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِۦ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلَٰٓئِكَتِهِۦ وَكُتُبِهِۦ وَرُسُلِهِۦ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِۦ وَقَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) believes in everything that was revealed to him by his Lord, as do the believers. All of them believe in Allah, all His angels, all His books that He revealed to the various prophets and all His messengers that He sent. They believe in such messengers without making any distinction between them. They say, ‘We have heard your instructions and prohibitions, and we obey You by following Your instructions and leaving Your prohibitions. We ask You to forgive us, O Lord, for in all our matters we return to You alone’."
"God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers.",285,2,لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ أَنتَ مَوْلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Allah only burdens a person with actions that he is able to do. Allah’s religion is based on ease and not difficulty. If any person does good, he will receive the reward for it in full. If any person does evil, he will receive the punishment for the sin he committed and no one will carry it for him. The Messenger and the believers said, ‘O Lord, do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake in doing something or saying something unintentionally. O Lord, do not burden us with that which is difficult for us and which we are unable to do as you had tasked those before us who were punished for their wrongs. Do not give us such instructions and prohibitions which are difficult for us and which we are unable to fulfil. By Your grace, overlook our sins, forgive us and have mercy on us. You are our guardian and helper, so give us victory over the disbelievers’."

There is no one worthy of being worshipped with love and reverence besides Him. He is Mighty and cannot be overpowered. He is Wise in His planning and legislation."
"He has sent down this Book which contains some verses that are categorical and basic to the Book, and others allegorical. But those who are twisted of mind look for verses metaphorical, seeking deviation and giving to them interpretations of their own; but none knows their meaning except God; and those who are steeped in knowledge affirm: ""We believe in them as all of them are from the Lord."" But only those who have wisdom understand.",6,3,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِنْهُ ءَايَٰتٌ مُّحْكَمَٰتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَٰبِهَٰتٌ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَٰبَهَ مِنْهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ ٱلْفِتْنَةِ وَٱبْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِۦ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَٱلرَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّآ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"O Prophet, He is the One Who revealed to you the Qur’ān, which contains verses with clear and unambiguous meaning, and these represent the majority of the Book and are the reference point when there is disagreement. It also contains other verses that may have more than one meaning and are puzzling for most people. Those who seek other than the truth leave the clear verses and focus on the unclear ones, trying to create doubts and mislead people, and interpret them to suit their corrupt views. No one knows the true meaning of such verses besides Allah. Those who are firm in knowledge say, ‘We have faith in the entire Qur’ān because it is all from Allah’. They interpret the unclear verses according to the clear ones. Only those who have sound minds pay attention to this."
"""Let us not go astray, O Lord, having guided us already. Bestow on us Your blessings for You are the benevolent.",7,3,رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,"The ones firm in knowledge say, ‘O Lord, do not let our hearts move away from the truth after you have shown it to us. Save us from what happened to those who moved away from the truth. Give us, from Your vast mercy, that which will guide our hearts and protect us from misguidance. Our Lord, You are the One who gives much’."
"You will gather mankind together, O Lord, on a day that is certain to come, and God does not fail in His promise.",8,3,رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"Our Lord, You are going to call all people back to You: to hold them to account on a day in which there is no doubt. Our Lord, You do not break promises."
"As for those who deny, neither their wealth nor their children will help them in the least against God. They shall be but faggots for (the fire of) Hell,",9,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَن تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ ٱلنَّارِ,The wealth and children of the disbelievers in Allah and His Messenger will not protect them from Allah’s punishment in this world nor in the Afterlife. Such disbelievers will be the fuel with which Hell will be lit on the Day of Resurrection.
"Like the people of the Pharaoh, and those before them, who rejected Our signs, and were punished for their sins by God; and the punishment of God is severe.",10,3,كَدَأْبِ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"The case of these disbelievers is like that of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them who disbelieved in Allah and denied His signs. As a result, Allah punished them for their sins – their wealth and children did not benefit them. Allah is severe in punishing those who disbelieve in Him and His signs."
"So tell the disbelievers: ""You will surely be subdued and driven to Hell: How bad a preparation!""",11,3,قُل لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ سَتُغْلَبُونَ وَتُحْشَرُونَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,"O Messenger, say to those who disbelieve, no matter what their religion, ‘The believers will defeat you and you will die as disbelievers. Allah will then gather you in the fire of Hell. What an evil resting place it will be for you!’"
"There was a token for you in the two armies which clashed (in the battle of Badr), one fighting for God, the other of unbelievers who saw with their own eyes the faithful to be two times as many as they, for God reinforces with His help whomsoever He will. In this is a lesson for those who have eyes.",12,3,قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ ءَايَةٌ فِى فِئَتَيْنِ ٱلْتَقَتَا فِئَةٌ تُقَٰتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُخْرَىٰ كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُم مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ ٱلْعَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَبْصَٰرِ,"There was a clear sign and lesson in the two groups that met to fight in the Battle of Badr. One group was made up of believers, and this was the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions: they were fighting for Allah’s sake and in order to raise His Word against the word of those who disbelieve. The other group consisted of the disbelievers of Makkah, who had come out in pride and for show. The believers actually saw the disbelievers as being double their real number; but Allah helped His allies. Allah gives His support to whomever He wishes. In that there is a lesson and a warning for those of insight to realize that the help of Allah can come to the believers even though they may be few in number; and that defeat can come to those on falsehood even though they may be great in number."
"Enamoured are the people of the lust of (earthly) pleasures, of women and of children and hoarded heaps of gold and silver, well-bred horses, and tilled land and cattle, all (vain) goods and chattels of the life of this world, while the best of abodes is with God.",13,3,زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱلْقَنَٰطِيرِ ٱلْمُقَنطَرَةِ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَبِ وَٱلْفِضَّةِ وَٱلْخَيْلِ ٱلْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ وَٱلْحَرْثِ ذَٰلِكَ مَتَٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُۥ حُسْنُ ٱلْمَـَٔابِ,"Allah tells us that He has made the love of desirable things of this world attractive to people in order to test them. These desirable things include women, children, wealth (in the form of gold and silver) that is overflowing and piled up, beautiful trained horses, livestock (such as camels, cows and sheep), as well as farmlands – all of which is the enjoyment of the life of the world which lasts only for a short while. A believer should not become attached to these things as Allah has kept the best place of return for him: the Paradise that is as wide as the heavens and the earth."
"Say: ""Shall I tell you of (things) even better? With the Lord are gardens with running streams of water for those who keep from evil and follow the straight path, where they will live unchanged with the purest of companions and blessings of God."" And under God's eyes are devotees",14,3,قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُم بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذَٰلِكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّٰتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَٰنٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"O Messenger, say: Shall I tell you about something better than those desirable things? Those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and avoiding His prohibitions will have gardens with trees and palaces overlooking flowing streams in which they will live eternally. They will also have wives who will be free from any defects in their form or character. In addition, they will gain the pleasure of Allah, and Allah will never be angry with them. Allah sees the actions of His servants, nothing is hidden from Him and He will recompense them for what they do."
"who say: ""O Lord, we believe; forgive our trespasses and save us the torment of Hell.""",15,3,ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,"The people of Paradise are the ones who say in their prayers, ‘Our Lord, we have faith in You and in that which You revealed to Your messengers; and we have followed Your sacred law. So, forgive the sins we have committed and protect us from the punishment of the fire of Hell’."
"They are the patient, the sincere and devout, full of charity, who pray for forgiveness in the hours of dawn.",16,3,ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ وَٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ وَٱلْقَٰنِتِينَ وَٱلْمُنفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِٱلْأَسْحَارِ,"They are the ones who are patient in doing good actions, leaving bad actions and in the face of calamity; truthful in their words and actions; fulfil Allah’s sacred law completely; spend their wealth in Allah’s path; and ask for forgiveness in the last part of the night when prayers are most likely accepted and when hearts are not distracted."
"God is witness there is no god but He, and so are the angels and men full of learning. He is the upholder of justice. There is no god but He, the mighty and all-wise.",17,3,شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْطِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Allah testifies that He alone is worthy of worship based on the legislative and universal signs indicating His divinity. The angels and people of knowledge also testify to this, by declaring and calling to His Oneness. They testified to the greatest thing anyone can testify to; the absolute right of Allah to be worshipped, and the perfect justice in His creation and sacred law. This is the greatest thing that anyone can testify to. There is no god but Him, the Mighty who can never be overpowered and the one who is Wise in His creation, planning and legislation."
"The true way with God is peace; and the people of the Book did not differ until knowledge (of this revelation) had come to them, out of mutual opposition. But those who deny the signs of God (should remember) He is swift in the reckoning.",18,3,إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمُ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"The acceptable path in Allah’s sight is Islam, the path of surrendering: devotion of all good actions to Allah alone, submission to Him in servitude and acceptance of all messengers, including the final messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) with whom revelations came to an end, and after whom no sacred laws will remain valid except his. The Jews and Christians only split up into various groups and sects, after evidence was established against them in the form of knowledge that had come to them, because of envy and greed for the world. Yet for whoever denies the verses of Allah revealed to His Messenger, Allah is quick in taking to account those who disbelieve in Him and His messengers."
"Even then if they argue, tell them: ""I have bowed in submission to God, and so have my followers."" And tell the people of the Book and the Arabs: ""Do you submit?"" If they do, they will find the right path; if they turn away, your duty is to deliver the message. And God keeps an eye on His votaries.",19,3,فَإِنْ حَآجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّهِ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِ وَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْأُمِّيِّۦنَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُوا۟ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَوا۟ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"If they argue with you, O Messenger, about the truth that has been revealed to you, then say to them in reply, ‘I and the believers who follow me have submitted to Allah’. Also, say, O Messenger, to the People of the Scripture and the idolaters, ‘Do you submit to Allah sincerely, following what I have brought?’ If they submit to Allah and follow your sacred law, then they are on the path of guidance. If they turn away from Islam, then your duty is only to give your message to them; then Allah will decide about them. He watches His servants and will reward them according to their actions."
"To those who deny the signs of God, and slay the apostles unjustly, and slay the upholders of justice, give news of painful punishment.",20,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Those who disbelieve in Allah’s signs, which show that He alone is the Lord and the One worthy of being worshipped, kill His prophets wrongly due to hatred, and kill those who call for justice by commanding good and forbidding evil – give these murderous disbelievers news of a painful punishment."
"Their good deeds will be wasted in this world and in the next, and none will they have to help them.",21,3,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"The actions of those who do such things are wasted and will not be of any benefit to them, neither in this world nor the Afterlife, due to their lack of faith. There will be no one to protect them from the punishment."
"Have you not seen the people who have received a part of Revelation who are called to the Book of God that it may judge (in their disputes) between them? But some, being averse turn away,",22,3,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ نَصِيبًا مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"O Prophet, did you not see the Jews who were given knowledge of the Torah proving your prophethood? When they are called to refer to the book of Allah, the Torah, so that it can decide about what they differ in, a group of their scholars and leaders turn away, ignoring the judgement of the Torah because it does not agree with their desires. The right thing for them to have done, having claimed that they follow the Torah, is to accept its judgement without hesitation."
"For they say: ""The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days."" They have been deceived by the lies they have themselves fabricated, and stray from their faith.",23,3,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا۟ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلَّآ أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَٰتٍ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِى دِينِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,They turned away from the truth and ignored it because they used to think that the fire of Hell will only touch them for a few days and they will then enter Paradise. This belief deceived them and made them bold against Allah and His religion.
"How shall it be when We gather them together on a day that is certain to come, when each will receive his reward without (favour or) wrong?",24,3,فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَٰهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"What will be their state and how much will they regret? It will be incredibly terrible when I gather them to give account on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Every person will be given the reward of his actions according to what he deserves, without there being any oppression by a reduction in good actions or an increase in evil actions."
"Say: ""O Lord of all dominions, You give whom it pleases You the kingdom, and You take away the power from whosoever You will; You exalt whom You please and debase whom You will. All goodness is Yours (entirely). Indeed You have the power over all things.",25,3,قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِى ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O Prophet, say in praise of your Lord and in declaration of His greatness: Allah, to You belongs all authority in this world and the Afterlife. You give authority to whomever of Your creation You wish, and remove it from whomever of Your creation You wish. You give honour to whomever You wish, and You disgrace whomever You wish. All of this is done according to Your wisdom and justice. All good lies only in Your hand. You have power over everything."
"You make the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night, raise the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and give whomsoever You please, and in measure without number.""",26,3,تُولِجُ ٱلَّيْلَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَىَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَىِّ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"A display of Your power is that You cause the night to become longer by making it enter into the day, and You cause the day to become longer by entering it into the night. You bring out the living from the dead – as in a believer from a disbeliever and crops from seed – and You bring out the dead from the living – as in a disbeliever from a believer and a chick from an egg. You give provision to whomever You wish, in abundance without any limit or count."
"Those who believe should not take unbelievers as their friends in preference to those who believe -- and whoever does so should have no (expectations) of God -- unless to safeguard yourselves against them. But God commands you to beware of Him, for to God you will journey in the end.",27,3,لَّا يَتَّخِذِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فِى شَىْءٍ إِلَّآ أَن تَتَّقُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ تُقَىٰةً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُۥ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O believers, do not take disbelievers as friends that you love and support instead of other believers: whoever does this will never be helped by Allah in any way. However, if you are under their authority and you fear for your lives, then there is no harm if you avoid their harm by being nice to them in your speech and actions on the outside, whilst hating them inside. Allah warns you of Himself, so fear Him and do not become the subject of His anger by committing sins. All men will return to Allah alone on the Day of Resurrection for Him to reward them for their actions."
"Say: ""Whether you conceal or reveal whatsoever is in your hearts it is all known to God, as is known to Him all that is in the heavens and the earth; and God has the power over all things.""",28,3,قُلْ إِن تُخْفُوا۟ مَا فِى صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Say, O Prophet: Whether you hide within your hearts that which Allah has forbidden, such as befriending the disbelievers, or you reveal the same, Allah knows about it. Nothing is hidden from Him. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He has power over everything and nothing is outside His ability."
"On the day when every man will find whatever of good he has earned and of evil, and is confronted with it, he shall wish that a distance appeared between him and that day -- (that it were far away). God bids you beware of Him, though compassionate is God to His votaries.",29,3,يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَرًا وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوٓءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُۥٓ أَمَدًۢا بَعِيدًا وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ رَءُوفٌۢ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"On the Day of Resurrection every person will find the good that he did in front of him, without any deficiency. Those who did bad will wish that there was a great distance between them and their bad actions – but shall a desire will be worthless! Allah warns you of Himself, so do not become the subject of His anger by committing sins. Allah is kind to His servants and therefore gives them this warning."
"Say: ""If you love God then follow me that God may love you and forgive your faults; for God is forgiving and kind.""",30,3,قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِى يُحْبِبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O Prophet, say: If you really love Allah, then follow what I have brought, on the inside and the outside. By doing this, you will gain Allah’s love and He will forgive your sins. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to those who repent to Him."
"Say: ""Obey God and His Messenger;"" and if they refuse (then remember) God does not love disbelievers.",31,3,قُلْ أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"O Prophet, say: Follow Allah and His Messenger by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. If they turn away from the command, then know that Allah does not love the disbelievers who go against His sacred law and the instructions of His Messenger."
God had chosen Adam and Noah and the families of Abraham and 'Imran in preference to others.,32,3,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰٓ ءَادَمَ وَنُوحًا وَءَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَءَالَ عِمْرَٰنَ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Allah honoured Adam (peace be upon him), by making the angels prostrate before him; Noah, by making him the first messenger to the people of the earth; the family of Abraham, by placing prophethood in his children; and the family of ‘Imrān, the father of Mary – which is a reference to Jesus (peace be upon him). He selected all of them and preferred them over all the people of their time."
They were descendants of one another; and God hears all and knows everything.,33,3,ذُرِّيَّةًۢ بَعْضُهَا مِنۢ بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,These prophets and their followers were all part of the same family: declaring Allah’s Oneness and doing good. They passed on noble character and virtues to one another. Allah hears the statements of His servants and knows their actions; and therefore chooses whomever He wills.
"Remember, when the wife of 'Imran prayed: ""O Lord, I offer what I carry in my womb in dedication to Your service, accept it, for You hear all and know everything.""",34,3,إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ عِمْرَٰنَ رَبِّ إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِى بَطْنِى مُحَرَّرًا فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّىٓ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Remember, O Messenger, when the wife of ‘Imrān, the mother of Mary, said: O Lord, I have made it a duty on myself to fully dedicate my unborn child to You, to worship You and Your House, so accept this act from me. You are the One who hears my prayer and knows my intention."
"And when she had given birth to the child, she said: ""O Lord, I have delivered but a girl."" -- But God knew better what she had delivered: A boy could not be as that girl was. ""I have named her Mary,"" (she said), ""and I give her into Your keeping. Preserve her and her children from Satan the ostracized.""",35,3,فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنثَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ ٱلذَّكَرُ كَٱلْأُنثَىٰ وَإِنِّى سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وَإِنِّىٓ أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ,"When she reached the end of her pregnancy and gave birth she was astonished – as she had hoped for a boy – and she said, ‘O Lord, I have given birth to a girl’. Allah knows what she gave birth to. Of course, a girl does not have the same strength and form as a boy that she had hoped for. She said, ‘I have named her Mary and I ask for Your mercy in protecting her and her children from the rejected Satan’."
"Her Lord accepted her graciously, and she grew up with excellence, and was given into the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah came to see her in the chamber, he found her provided with food, and he asked: ""Where has this come from, O Mary?"" And she said: ""From God who gives food in abundance to whomsoever He will.""",36,3,فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنۢبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا ٱلْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يَٰمَرْيَمُ أَنَّىٰ لَكِ هَٰذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"Allah graciously accepted the dedication and brought her up well. He made the hearts of His pious servants incline caringly to her and put her in the care of the Prophet Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah would enter her place of worship he would find wholesome food there. So, he asked her, ‘O Mary, where did you get this food from?’ She replied, ‘This food is from Allah. Allah gives to whomever He wishes in abundance without account’."
"Then prayed Zachariah to his Lord: ""O Lord, bestow on me offspring, virtuous and good, for You answer all prayers.""",37,3,هُنَالِكَ دَعَا زَكَرِيَّا رَبَّهُۥ قَالَ رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنكَ ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,"When Zachariah saw the food that Allah was miraculously giving to Mary, he became hopeful that Allah would give him a child despite being very old and his wife being unable to bear children. He said: O Lord, give me a good child. You hear the prayer of the person who prays to You and You know his condition."
"Then the angels said to him as he stood in the chamber at prayer: ""God sends you good tidings of John who will confirm a thing from God and be noble, continent, and a prophet, and one of those who are upright and do good.""",38,3,فَنَادَتْهُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَآئِمٌ يُصَلِّى فِى ٱلْمِحْرَابِ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكَ بِيَحْيَىٰ مُصَدِّقًۢا بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَسَيِّدًا وَحَصُورًا وَنَبِيًّا مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"The angels called out to him while he was standing in prayer in his place of worship, saying: Allah gives you good news of a child to be born to you whose name will be John. He will confirm a word from Allah – which refers to Jesus, son of Mary, because he was specially created by a word from Allah. This child will be a leader of his people with his knowledge and worship. He will be innocent, keeping himself away from desires, including approaching women. He will dedicate himself to worshipping His Lord and will also be a prophet from those who are righteous."
"""How can I have a son, O Lord,"" he said, ""for I am old and my wife is barren?"" ""Thus,"" came the answer, ""God does as He wills.""",39,3,قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِى غُلَٰمٌ وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِىَ ٱلْكِبَرُ وَٱمْرَأَتِى عَاقِرٌ قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ ٱللَّهُ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ,"When the angels gave him the good news about John, Zachariah said, ‘O Lord, how can I have a child after I have become old and my wife is unable to bear children?’ Allah replied to him that the example of the creation of John, in spite of his old age and his wife being barren, is like that of the creation of anything that Allah wishes to create, even though it is out of the ordinary. This is because Allah has power over everything and does whatever He wills in His wisdom and knowledge."
"And Zachariah said: ""Give me a token, O Lord."" ""The token will be,"" was the reply, ""that you will speak to no man for three days except by signs; and remember your Lord much, and pray at evening and sunrise.""",40,3,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَل لِّىٓ ءَايَةً قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلَّا تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلَٰثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلَّا رَمْزًا وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيرًا وَسَبِّحْ بِٱلْعَشِىِّ وَٱلْإِبْكَٰرِ,"Zachariah said: O Lord, give me a sign that my wife is pregnant. Allah said: The sign that you want is that you will not be able to speak for three days, except by indications, and this will not be because of any disability. So, remember Allah much and glorify Him at the end and beginning of the day."
"The angels said: ""O Mary, indeed God has favoured you and made you immaculate, and chosen you from all the women of the world.",41,3,وَإِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰكِ وَطَهَّرَكِ وَٱصْطَفَىٰكِ عَلَىٰ نِسَآءِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when the angels said to Mary (peace be upon her): Allah has chosen you because of the praiseworthy qualities you have. He has purified you from all defects, and chosen you over all the other women of your time."
"So adore your Lord, O Mary, and pay homage and bow with those who bow in prayer.""",42,3,يَٰمَرْيَمُ ٱقْنُتِى لِرَبِّكِ وَٱسْجُدِى وَٱرْكَعِى مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ,"O Mary, stand for long periods in prayer, prostrate to your Lord and bow down with His righteous servants who bow down to Him."
"This is news of the Unknown that We send you, for you were not there when they cast lots with quills (to determine) who should take care of Mary, nor when they disputed it.",43,3,ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُونَ أَقْلَٰمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"The story of Zachariah and Mary is one of the reports of [the Ghaib] which I reveal to you, O Messenger. You were not there with those scholars and worshippers when they argued about who was most entitled to raise Mary. They eventually decided to draw lots by throwing their pens, and the pen of Zachariah (peace be upon him) won."
"When the angels said: ""O Mary, God gives you news of a thing from Him, for rejoicing, (news of one) whose name will be Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in this world and the next, and one among the honoured,",44,3,إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ ٱسْمُهُ ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهًا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when the angels said: O Mary, Allah gives you good news of a child who will be created without a father: merely by a word from Allah, such as ‘Be’, and he will become a child by Allah’s will. The name of this child will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary. He will have a high rank in this world and the Afterlife and he will be one of those who are made close to Allah."
"Who will speak to the people when in the cradle and when in the prime of life, and will be among the upright and doers of good.""",45,3,وَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِى ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلًا وَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"This child will miraculously speak to people when he is a small baby, as well as when he grows up and becomes a man. He will tell them what is best for them in their religious and worldly affairs. He will also be one of those who are righteous in their words and actions."
"She said: ""How can I have a son, O Lord, when no man has touched me?"" He said: ""That is how God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says 'Be', and it is.",46,3,قَالَتْ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِى وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ قَالَ كَذَٰلِكِ ٱللَّهُ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ إِذَا قَضَىٰٓ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"Mary was surprised that she was to have a child without a husband and said in astonishment: How can I have a child when no man has come near me in a lawful or unlawful way? The angel said to her: Just as Allah will create a child for you without a father, He creates whatever He wishes even though it may be out of the ordinary. When Allah wishes for something, He says ‘Be’ and it is. Nothing can stop Him doing as He wills."
"He will teach him the Law and the judgement, and the Torah and the Gospel,",47,3,وَيُعَلِّمُهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ وَٱلْإِنجِيلَ,Allah will teach him to say and do things correctly; and He will teach him the Torah that He had revealed to Moses (peace be upon him) and the Gospel which He will reveal to him.
"And he will be Apostle to the children of Israel, (saying:) 'I have come to you with a prodigy from your Lord that I will fashion the state of destiny out of mire for you, and breathe (a new spirit) into it, and (you) will rise by the will of God. I will heal the blind and the leper, and infuse life into the dead, by the leave of God. I will tell you what you devour and what you hoard in your homes. In this will be a portent for you if you do believe.",48,3,وَرَسُولًا إِلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ أَنِّى قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِـَٔايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِّىٓ أَخْلُقُ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْـَٔةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْرًۢا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبْرِئُ ٱلْأَكْمَهَ وَٱلْأَبْرَصَ وَأُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِى بُيُوتِكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Allah will make him a messenger to the Israelites, instructing him to say to them: I am Allah’s messenger to you. I have brought to you a sign indicating my prophethood: I will make the shape of a bird using clay, then I will breathe into it and it will become a living bird by Allah’s permission. I will cure the one who was born blind, so that he will be able to see, and the leper who will recover from his illness; and I will bring the dead to life. I will do all of this with Allah’s permission. I will tell you about what you consume and what you hide in your homes. In all of these extraordinary things that I mentioned to you, which human beings cannot do, is a clear sign that I am Allah’s messenger to you, if you wish to have faith and to accept the proof."
"I (have come to) confirm the truth of the Torah which was sent down before me, and make certain things lawful which have been forbidden until now; and I come to you with a sign from your Lord; so be fearful of God and follow me.",49,3,وَمُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَلِأُحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَجِئْتُكُم بِـَٔايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,"I have come to you to confirm the revelation of the Torah that was before me, and to make lawful some of that which was unlawful in the past: making things easy for you. I have brought to you a clear proof of the truthfulness of what I say, so be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions; and follow that which I call you to."
"Surely God is my Lord, and your Lord, so worship Him; and this is the right path.",50,3,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"Allah is my Lord and your Lord, and He is the only One that deserves to be followed and feared. So, worship Him alone. This worship of Allah and being mindful of Him that I instruct you to do is the straight path which has no crookedness."
"When Jesus perceived their unbelief he asked: ""Who will help me in the way of God?"" ""We,"" the disciples answered, ""shall be the helpers of God. We believe in God; and you be our witness that we submit and obey.",51,3,فَلَمَّآ أَحَسَّ عِيسَىٰ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ قَالَ مَنْ أَنصَارِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنصَارُ ٱللَّهِ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ,"When Jesus realized that they were going to continue in their disbelief, he addressed the Israelites, saying, ‘Who will help me in calling towards Allah?’ His chosen followers said: We are the ones who will help Allah’s religion. We have faith in Allah and we follow you. Be a witness, O Jesus, that we submit to Allah by accepting His Oneness and following Him."
"""O Lord, we believe in Your revelations and follow this Apostle. Enroll us among the witnesses.""",52,3,رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا بِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ وَٱتَّبَعْنَا ٱلرَّسُولَ فَٱكْتُبْنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"The disciples also said: Our Lord, we have believed in the Gospel that you revealed and we have followed the messenger, Jesus (peace be upon him), so make us of those who are witnesses to the truth and who have faith in You and Your messengers."
"But they (the unbelievers) contrived a plot, and God did the like; and God's plan is the best.",53,3,وَمَكَرُوا۟ وَمَكَرَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلْمَٰكِرِينَ,"The disbelievers from the Israelites plotted to kill Jesus (peace be upon him), so Allah planned to leave them in their misguidance; and He made another person resemble Jesus (peace be upon him) on the occasion when they actually tried to murder him. Allah is the best plotter, because there can be nothing more severe than His plot against His enemies."
"When God said: ""O Jesus, I will take you to Myself and exalt you, and rid you of the infidels, and hold those who follow you above those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection. You have then to come back to Me when I will judge between you in what you were at variance.""",54,3,إِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَىٰٓ إِنِّى مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَىَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَجَاعِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ ثُمَّ إِلَىَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Allah also planned against them by saying to Jesus: O Jesus, I will take you away alive, raise your body and soul to Me, rid you of the filth of those who disbelieved you and distance you from them. I will make those who follow you part of the true religion, which includes acceptance of Muhammad (peace be upon him); and they will have greater proof and might over those who disbelieve you until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me alone will be your return on the Day of Resurrection and I will pass true judgement between you regarding your differences."
Those who are infidels will surely receive severe punishment both in this world and the next; and none will they have to help (or save) them.,55,3,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"As for those who disbelieved you and the truth you brought to them, I will punish them severely in the world by making them suffer being killed, imprisoned and disgraced; and in the Afterlife, I will punish them in the fire of Hell. They will have no one to help them against the punishment."
But those who believe and do good deeds shall be given their recompense in full; but God does not love the unjust.,56,3,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"As for those who had faith in you and the truth that you brought to them, and did good actions (such as prayer, charity, fasting, keeping family relations, etc.), then Allah will give them the reward of their actions in full without any reduction. This refers to the followers of the Messiah before the coming of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), whose coming was confirmed by the Messiah himself. Allah does not love those who do wrong and the greatest wrong is to ascribe partners to Allah and to disbelieve His messengers."
These verses that We read to you are signs and reminder full of wisdom.,57,3,ذَٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَٱلذِّكْرِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"This account of Jesus which is recited to you is a clear sign indicating the truth of what was revealed to you. It is a perfect message for those who are mindful of Allah, as it contains nothing false."
"For God the likeness of Jesus is as that of Adam whom He fashioned out of dust and said ""Be"" and he was.",58,3,إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُۥ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"With Allah, the example of the creation of Jesus (peace be upon him) is like the creation of Adam, who was born from dust without a father or mother. Allah simply said to him: Become a man. And he became as Allah willed. How do you then assume that Jesus is a god on the basis that he has no father when you accept that Adam is human despite his having no father or mother?"
"This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be in doubt.",59,3,ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,"The undoubtable truth about Jesus is that which was revealed to you by your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt and are unsure. Instead, be firm on the truth that you have."
"Tell those who dispute this with you even after the knowledge that has reached you: ""Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, and pray and solicit God to condemn those who lie.""",60,3,فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا۟ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وَأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"If anyone of the Christians disputes with you, O Messenger, regarding the matter of Jesus, and claims that he was not Allah’s servant after the correct knowledge has come to you, then say to them, ‘Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves; and let us gather together and then pray to Allah to send down His curse on those of us who are lying’."
"And this verily is the true account. There is no god but God, and God is all-mighty and all-wise.",61,3,إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْقَصَصُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,That which has been mentioned to you about Jesus (peace be upon him) is the true tale that contains no lie or doubt. There is no one worthy of worship besides Allah alone. Allah is Mighty in His authority and Wise in His planning and instruction.
If they turn away (remember) God knows the mischief-mongers.,62,3,فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"If they turn away from what you have brought and do not follow you, then it is because they are corrupt. Allah knows those who cause corruption in the earth and He will recompense them for that."
"Tell them: ""O people of the Book, let us come to an agreement on that which is common between us, that we worship no one but God, and make none His compeer, and that none of us take any others for lord apart from God."" If they turn away you tell them: ""Bear witness that we submit to Him.""",63,3,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ تَعَالَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍۭ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِۦ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَقُولُوا۟ ٱشْهَدُوا۟ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: O Jews and Christians, People of the Scripture, come let us unite on a fair word in which we are all equal: that we worship Allah alone and we do not worship anyone besides Him, no matter what his rank and no matter how high is his status; and that we do not take one another as lords to be worshipped and followed besides Allah. If they turn away from the truth and fairness that you call them towards, then, O believers, say to them: Bear witness that we have surrendered to Allah and are obedient to Him."
"O people of the Book, why dispute about Abraham? The Torah and the Gospel were sent down after him: Do you not understand?",64,3,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِىٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَتِ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةُ وَٱلْإِنجِيلُ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦٓ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"O People of the Scripture, why do you dispute about the belief of Abraham? The Jews claimed that he was a Jew and the Christians claimed he was a Christian. You know very well that Judaism and Christianity appeared a long time after him. Can you not see the falseness of your statement and the error of your claim?"
"Remember you are those who disputed the things you knew; so wherefore dispute about things you do not know? And God has the knowledge, while you do not know.",65,3,هَٰٓأَنتُمْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ حَٰجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُم بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"You, People of the Scripture, argued without knowledge with the Prophet (peace be upon him) about your religion and about what was revealed to you. Why, then, do you dispute about Abraham and his religion, which you do not know, as it is not in your book and your prophets did not discuss it? Allah knows the reality of things and you do not know."
"Neither was Abraham a Jew nor a Christian, but upright and obedient, and not an idolater.",66,3,مَا كَانَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Abraham was not a Jew or Christian in belief, but he was opposed to all false religions and obedient to Allah alone. He was also not one of those who ascribe partners to Allah – contrary to the idolaters of the Arabs, who claim to follow his belief."
"Of all men the nearest to Abraham are those who follow him, and then this Prophet and the faithful; and God is the protector of all believers.",67,3,إِنَّ أَوْلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِإِبْرَٰهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَٰذَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِىُّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The people who are most entitled to claim a link to Abraham are those who followed him in his time, as well as this Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and those who have faith in him from this nation. Allah helps and protects the believers."
"Some among the people of the Book wish to lead you astray, yet they lead none astray but themselves, though they do not realise.",68,3,وَدَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"The scholars of the Jews and the Christians desire to mislead you, O believers, away from the truth that Allah has guided you to. Yet they only mislead themselves because their attempt to mislead the believers only increases their misguidance, and they do not know the consequence of their actions."
"O people of the Book, why do you disbelieve the signs of God having witnessed them yourselves?",69,3,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,"O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, why do you disbelieve Allah’s words which were sent down to you and the clear indication they contain of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), whilst you are witness to the fact that it is the truth contained in your books?"
"O people of the Book, why do you mix the false with the true, and hide the truth knowingly?",70,3,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"O People of the Scripture, why do you mix the truth contained in your books with falsehood from yourselves? Why do you hide the truth and guidance contained in your book, such as the truthfulness of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), when you know what is true and what is false?"
"A section of the people of the Book say: ""Believe in the morning what has been revealed to the faithful, and deny in the evening; they might perhaps turn back;",71,3,وَقَالَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَجْهَ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱكْفُرُوٓا۟ ءَاخِرَهُۥ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"A group of Jewish scholars said: On the outside, accept the Qur’ān which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and then reject it at the end of the day, so that, after seeing this, they begin to have doubts about their religion and turn back from it saying, ‘These people know better about Allah’s Book and they have turned back’."
"""And do not believe those who do not belong to your faith."" Say: ""True guidance is the guidance of God -- that any may be given the like of what has been given you."" Will they argue with you before your Lord? Say: ""God's is the bounty. He gives whomsoever He please, for He is infinite and all-wise.""",72,3,وَلَا تُؤْمِنُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْهُدَىٰ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ أَن يُؤْتَىٰٓ أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"They also said: Do not believe or accept anyone unless he is a Jew and follows your religion. Say, O Messenger: Guidance to the truth is the Guidance of Allah; not the disbelief and stubbornness that you display, fearing that anyone else could be given a bounty similar to what you were given, or that they would argue with you before your Lord if you acknowledged what was revealed to them. Say, O Messenger: Bounty is in Allah’s Hand and He gives it to whomever of His servants He wills: His bounty is not restricted to any one nation. Allah is embracing and He knows who is deserving."
"He may choose whom He likes for His favours, for great is His bounty.",73,3,يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"He selects whomever of His creation He wishes to receive His mercy and blesses them with guidance, prophethood and numerous favours. Allah’s bounty is great and has no limit."
"There are some among the people of the Book who return a whole treasure entrusted to them; yet some there are who do not give back a dinar until you demand and insist, because they say: ""It is not a sin for us to (usurp) the rights of the Arabs."" Yet they lie against God, and they know it.",74,3,وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنطَارٍ يُؤَدِّهِۦٓ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لَّا يُؤَدِّهِۦٓ إِلَيْكَ إِلَّا مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَآئِمًا ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا۟ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِى ٱلْأُمِّيِّۦنَ سَبِيلٌ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"There are some People of the Scripture who, if you hand over a large amount of wealth, will honour the trust. On the other hand, there are some of them who, if you trust them with a small amount, will not return the trust unless you persistently demand it from them. That is because they wrongly claim that there is no sin on them for any crime they commit against the Arabs or if they consume the wealth of the Arabs, since Allah has permitted that for them. They say such lies knowing that it is a false attribution to Allah."
"But certainly whoever keeps his promise and follows the right path (will be blessed), for God loves those who shun evil and follow the right course.",75,3,بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِۦ وَٱتَّقَىٰ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"It is not as they claimed: in fact, there is a sin on them. However, if anyone fulfils his promise to Allah to have faith in Him and His Messenger, as well as his promise to people to honour their trusts, and is mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, then Allah loves those who are mindful of Him and will give them the best reward."
"Those who trade on the promises of God, and who purchase a little gain from their oaths, will have no share in the life to come. God will not address or even regard them on the Day of Resurrection, nor perfect them, and their suffering will be painful.",76,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَيْمَٰنِهِمْ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَا خَلَٰقَ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَا يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who take a small amount of this world in exchange of Allah’s advice to them to follow His revelation and His messengers, and in exchange of the oaths they took to fulfil Allah’s pledge, will have no share in the reward of the Afterlife. Allah will not speak kindly to them and will not look at them mercifully on the Day of Resurrection. They will receive a painful punishment."
"Among them is a section which distorts in reading the Scripture in a way that though it sounds like the Scripture, in fact it is not; yet they say it is from God, when they know it is not; and they lie about God, and knowingly.",77,3,وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقًا يَلْوُۥنَ أَلْسِنَتَهُم بِٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"There is a group of Jews who twist their tongues when reciting the Torah that was revealed by Allah, so that you think that they are reciting from the Torah, whereas it is not from the Torah. Instead, it is their lies and fabrications against Allah. They say: What we recite has been revealed by Allah – whereas it was not revealed by Allah. They tell lies about Allah when they know they are lying against Allah and His messengers."
"It is not for a mortal to whom God reveals the Book and the judgement and the prophethood to say to the people: ""Be my votaries instead of God's,"" but (to say): ""Become learned in divine law, by virtue of teaching and studying the Book.""",78,3,مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيَهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُوا۟ عِبَادًا لِّى مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا۟ رَبَّٰنِيِّۦنَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ,"It is not right for a man whom Allah gives a book revealed by Him, together with knowledge and understanding and selects him as a prophet, to say then to people, ‘Become servants of me instead of Allah’. Rather, he should say to them: Be righteous scholars-acting on what you know, because of your teaching the revealed book to people and because of your studying it by memorising and understanding it."
He will surely not bid you make the angels and the prophets your lords. Would he order you disbelief after you have submitted (and accepted the law of God)?,79,3,وَلَا يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُوا۟ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ أَرْبَابًا أَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,It is also not right for such a man to instruct you to take the angels and the prophets as lords to be worshipped besides Allah. Is it possible that he would instruct you to disbelieve after you have become devoted and have surrendered to Him?
"Remember when God covenanted the prophets (and said): ""If after I have given you the Law and the judgement there comes an apostle to you who confirms the truth already with you, you will surely believe him and help him;"" and asked: ""Do you accept and agree to the terms of My covenant?"" They said: ""We accept."" ""Then you be witness,"" said God, ""and I shall be witness with you.",80,3,وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَٰقَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ لَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَٰبٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِۦ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُۥ قَالَ ءَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِى قَالُوٓا۟ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَٱشْهَدُوا۟ وَأَنَا۠ مَعَكُم مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Allah took an affirmed promise from the prophets, saying to them: If I give you a revealed book, teach you wisdom and make you reach a high rank and status, and then My Messenger comes to you confirming the book and wisdom that you have, then you must accept what he brings and help him as his followers. Do you, O prophets, accept this and give Me a firm commitment for that? They replied, ‘We accept that’. Allah said: Bear witness against yourselves and your communities, and I will also be a witness against you and them."
"Then any one who turns away will be a transgressor.""",81,3,فَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"Whoever turns away after this promise witnessed by Allah and His messengers, they are the ones who leave the religion of Allah and His obedience."
"Do they seek another way than God's? But whosoever is in the heavens and the earth is submissive to God and obedient (to Him), by choice or constraint, and will be returned to Him.",82,3,أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ ٱللَّهِ يَبْغُونَ وَلَهُۥٓ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,"Do these people, who leave the religion of Allah and His obedience, look for something other than the religion Allah has chosen for His worship when every creation in the heavens and earth surrenders to Him, whether willingly like the believers, or unwillingly, like the disbelievers? Then all of creation will return to Him on the Day of Resurrection to give an account for their actions."
"Say: ""We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us, and in what had been sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring, and what had been revealed to Moses and to Jesus and to all other prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between them, and we submit to Him and obey.""",83,3,قُلْ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, that you have faith in Allah, doing as He instructs you, and that you have faith in the revelation that was given to you, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and in what was revealed to the prophets among Jacob’s descendants, and in the scriptures and miracles that were given to Moses, Jesus and all the prophets by their Lord. Also, say that you make no distinction between them, believing in all of them, and that you are bound to Allah alone, surrendering in devotion to Him."
"And whoever seeks a way other than submission to God, it will not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the world to come.",84,3,وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,Whoever seeks a path other than that which Allah has endorsed – the path of surrendering (Islam) – it will not be accepted from them by Allah. They will be of those who have lost their souls by entering the fire of Hell.
"How can God show the way to those who, having come to faith, turned away, even though they had borne witness that the Messenger was true, and the clear signs had reached them? God does not show the unrighteous the way.",85,3,كَيْفَ يَهْدِى ٱللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُوا۟ بَعْدَ إِيمَٰنِهِمْ وَشَهِدُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱلرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"How shall Allah grant faith in Him and in His messengers to a people who disbelieved after having faith in Allah and witnessing that what the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought was the truth, and after clear proofs of the truth of this have come to them? Allah does not grant faith in Him to a people who are wrongdoers and who choose error instead of guidance."
For such the requital is the curse of God and the angels and of men.,86,3,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,The reward of those wrongdoers who choose falsehood is the condemnation of Allah and the angels and the people all together; and they are excluded and removed from the mercy of Allah.
"They shall live under it, and none of their agony decrease nor be respite for them.",87,3,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا لَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"These disbelievers will live eternally in the fire of Hell, never to leave! Their suffering will not be lightened and they will not be given more time to repent and ask for forgiveness."
"But those who repent and reform, God is surely forgiving and merciful.",88,3,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"This punishment is for everyone except those who repent to Allah, asking for forgiveness, after their disbelief and disobedience, and correct what they have done. Truly, Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate to those who repent to Him."
"Those who deny, having once come to faith, and persist in denial, will not have their repentance accepted, for they have gone astray.",89,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بَعْدَ إِيمَٰنِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُوا۟ كُفْرًا لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلضَّآلُّونَ,"Those who disbelieve after having faith, and stick to this disbelief until they die, then repenting to Allah and asking for forgiveness at the time of death, will not have this accepted from them, as the time for acceptance would have expired. They are those who have lost their way from the straight path which leads to Allah."
"From those who deny and die disbelieving will never be accepted an earthful of gold if proferred by them as ransom. For them is grievous punishment, and none will help them.",90,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَمَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ ٱلْأَرْضِ ذَهَبًا وَلَوِ ٱفْتَدَىٰ بِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"Those who disbelieve and die while in disbelief will not be able to ransom themselves from receiving the punishment of Allah, even were they to try and ransom themselves with the weight of the entire earth in gold. They will have a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers on the Day of Judgement to remove them from their suffering."
You will never come to piety unless you spend of things you love; and whatever you spend is known to God.,91,3,لَن تَنَالُوا۟ ٱلْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِن شَىْءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِۦ عَلِيمٌ,"O believers, you will not receive the reward of the people of goodness and their rank until you spend the wealth you love in the way of Allah. Whatever you spend, big or small, Allah is aware of your intentions and of what you do; and everyone will be rewarded accordingly."
"To the children of Israel was lawful all food except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah was revealed. Say: ""Bring the Torah and recite it, if what you say is true.""",92,3,كُلُّ ٱلطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِلًّا لِّبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ إِلَّا مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِۦ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةُ قُلْ فَأْتُوا۟ بِٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ فَٱتْلُوهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"All wholesome foods were lawful for the Israelites, except which Jacob (peace be upon him) had made unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed. These were not, as the Jews claimed to the Prophet Muhammad, made unlawful in the Torah. Tell them, O Prophet, to bring the Torah and read it if they are telling the truth in what they claim. When the Jews heard this, they did not know how to respond, so they did not bring the Torah to recite to him. This is an example of the Jews changing things and not telling the truth about what was in the Torah."
"And anyone who fabricates lies about God even after this, is wicked indeed.",93,3,فَمَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,Whoever invents a lie against Allah after the evidence has been made clear – such as the fact that Jacob made certain foods unlawful for himself in a vow and that they were not made unlawful by Allah – then they are wronging themselves by turning away from the obvious truth.
"Say: ""God has veritably spoken the truth. So now follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not of idolaters.""",94,3,قُلْ صَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ فَٱتَّبِعُوا۟ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Tell them, O Prophet, that Allah has spoken the truth about Jacob (peace be upon him), and in everything that He has revealed and established in the sacred law. Also, tell them to follow the religion Abraham (peace be upon him): he abandoned all other ways of life for the path of surrendering in devotion to Allah, by worshipping Him and following His sacred law – he only worshipped Allah."
"The first House of God to be set up for men was at Bakkah the blessed, a guidance for the people of the world.",95,3,إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكًا وَهُدًى لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"The first House built on earth for all people to worship Allah was the Sacred House of Allah in Makkah: a House of worship full of worldly and sacred blessings, and guidance for all the worlds."
"It contains clear signs, and the spot where Abraham had stood. And anyone who enters it will find security. And whosoever can afford should visit the House on a pilgrimage as duty to God. Whosoever denies, should remember that God is independent of the peoples of the world.",96,3,فِيهِ ءَايَٰتٌۢ بَيِّنَٰتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُۥ كَانَ ءَامِنًا وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِىٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"In this place of worship are clear signs of its special honour and blessings, such as the acts of worship performed in it, and its landmarks, including the stone that Abraham stood on when he was raising the walls of the Kaaba; and whoever enters it is safe, with no harm coming to them. People have a duty to Allah to perform the acts of Hajj in this House of worship, if they are able to do so. Whoever rejects the duty of Hajj disbelieves in Allah, and Allah is in no need of them or anything all in the worlds."
"Say: ""O people of the Book, why do you reject the word of God when God is a witness to all that you do?""",97,3,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"O Prophet, ask the People of the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, why they reject the proof of the truth of your prophet-hood, including the proofs that came in the Torah and the Gospel, when Allah watches over everything you do, witnessing it, and will reward you accordingly."
"Then say: ""O people of the Book, why do you turn the believers away from the path of God, looking for obliquities in the way when you are witness to it? And God is aware of all that you do.""",98,3,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لِمَ تَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَأَنتُمْ شُهَدَآءُ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"O Prophet, ask the People of the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, why they stop people who have faith from the Religion of Allah, wanting to twist it from the truth to falsehood, and turning its people from guidance to misguidance, when they witness that it is the truth confirming what is in their scriptures. Allah is not unaware of what they do in disbelieving it and preventing people from following it; and they will be repaid accordingly."
"O believers, if you follow what some of the people of the Book say, it will turn you into unbelievers even after you have come to belief.",99,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن تُطِيعُوا۟ فَرِيقًا مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَرُدُّوكُم بَعْدَ إِيمَٰنِكُمْ كَٰفِرِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Prophet, if you follow a group of the People of the Scripture, from the Jews or the Christians, in what they say, and accept their opinion in what they claim, then you will return to disbelief after your faith because of their envy and their misguidance."
"And how can you disbelieve? To you are being recited the messages of God, and His prophet is among you. And whosoever holds fast to God shall verily be guided to the path that is straight.",100,3,وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ وَأَنتُمْ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتُ ٱللَّهِ وَفِيكُمْ رَسُولُهُۥ وَمَن يَعْتَصِم بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ هُدِىَ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"How could you disbelieve in Allah after you have had faith in Him, especially when you have the biggest reason for having firm faith with you? The verses of Allah are being recited to you, and the Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) is making them clear to you. Whoever holds on firmly to the Book of Allah and His Messenger’s way of life, Allah has guided them to the right path."
"O believers, fear God as He should be feared, and do not die but submitting (to Him).",101,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِۦ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, be mindful of Allah as you have been commanded, by following what He instructs you to do, and by staying away from what He prohibits you from doing; and be thankful for His favour, holding firmly to the religion He has given you, so that when you die, you die surrendering in devotion to Him."
"Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favours God bestowed on you when you were one another's foe and He reconciled your hearts, and you turned into brethren through His grace. You had stood on the edge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it, thus revealing to you His clear signs that you may find the right way perchance.",102,3,وَٱعْتَصِمُوا۟ بِحَبْلِ ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا۟ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَآءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِۦٓ إِخْوَٰنًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Hold tightly, O you who have faith, to the Book and the traditions of the Prophet, and do not do that which will bring division amongst you. Remember the blessings of Allah upon you when you were enemies before Islam, fighting each other for the slightest reason, and He brought your hearts together through Islam, so that you became brothers in your faith through His grace, showing each other love and respect and listening to each other’s advice. Before that you were on the brink of entering the fire of Hell because of your disbelief. Allah saved you from the fire of Hell through Islam and guided you to faith. In the way that Allah has made this clear to you, He also makes clear to you what will put things right for you in this world and the Afterlife, so that you are guided to the right way of life."
"So let there be a body among you who may call to the good, enjoin what is esteemed and forbid what is odious. They are those who will be successful.",103,3,وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"Let there be from you, O believers, a group who calls to all that is good and loved by Allah, instructing people to do what is right from the sacred law and from what you know to be good and just; and forbidding what is wrong, which is prohibited by the sacred law and which you know to be wrong and unjust. The people who do this will have complete success in this world and the Afterlife."
So be not like those who became disunited and differed among themselves after clear proofs had come to them. For them is great suffering.,104,3,وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا۟ وَٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Do not be, O believers, like the People of the Scripture who became divided into different groups and divisions, disagreeing about their faith and way of life after clear signs had come to them from Allah. Such people will have a great punishment from Allah."
"On the Day when some faces would be bright, and some others will be black (with despair), those with black faces (will be told): ""Having come to the faith you denied it; now taste therefore the penalty for you disbelieved.""",105,3,يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكَفَرْتُم بَعْدَ إِيمَٰنِكُمْ فَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,"This great punishment will come upon them on the Day of Judgement, when the faces of those who have faith will become whitened, lighting up with joy and happiness; and the faces of those who denied the truth will become blackened, darkened with sadness and despair. As for those whose faces become blackened on that great day, they will be asked how they could reject faith in Allah alone, and deny the promise they made with Him that they would not worship anything besides Him, when they had had faith and acknowledged it. They will be told to taste the punishment Allah has prepared for them because of their disbelief."
And those with bright faces shall be under God's grace and enjoy it for ever.,106,3,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱبْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِى رَحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"As for those whose faces become whitened, they will remain in Paradise, eternally blessed."
These are the commandments of God We recite to you verily; God does not wish injustice to the creatures of the world.,107,3,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ظُلْمًا لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Prophet, these verses recited to you which contain Allah’s promises and threats, are true in what they contain of information, and just in what they contain of laws. Allah does not desire injustice for any creature in the worlds, and no one receives a punishment unless they earned it through their own bad actions."
"For to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and to God do all things return.",108,3,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"To Allah alone belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, in creation and decree, and everything will return to Him on the Day of Judgement, when everyone will be rewarded according to what they have done."
"Of all the communities raised among men you are the best, enjoining the good, forbidding the wrong, and believing in God. If the people of the Book had come to believe it was best for them; but only some believe, and transgressors are many.",109,3,كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ ءَامَنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُم مِّنْهُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"You are, O Community of Muhammad (peace be upon him), the best of all communities that Allah has produced for humanity – in your faith and actions – and the most beneficial for other people: instructing what is right according to the sacred law and what you know to be right, and forbidding what is wrong according to the sacred law and what you know to be wrong; and having certain faith in Allah, so that it shows in your actions. If the People of the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, had faith in Muhammad it would be better for them in this world and in the Afterlife. Only few of the People of the Scripture believe in what Muhammad (peace be upon him) came with and most of them do not stay within the sacred way of life and sacred law of Allah."
"They will do you no harm but annoyance; and if they fight you they will only turn their backs, then no help will reach them.",110,3,لَن يَضُرُّوكُمْ إِلَّآ أَذًى وَإِن يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ يُوَلُّوكُمُ ٱلْأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لَا يُنصَرُونَ,"If they are against you they will not harm you, O believers, in your belief, or in yourselves, except through their words: criticising your faith and making fun of you and so on. Also, if they fight you they will flee from you in defeat, and will never be victorious over you."
"Degraded they shall live wheresoever they be unless they make an alliance with God and alliance with men, for they have incurred the anger of God, and misery overhangs them. That is because they denied the signs of God and killed the prophets unjustly, and rebelled, and went beyond the limit.",111,3,ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ أَيْنَ مَا ثُقِفُوٓا۟ إِلَّا بِحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ يَكْفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلْأَنۢبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا۟ وَّكَانُوا۟ يَعْتَدُونَ,"Humiliation and shame has been made to surround them wherever they are, and they are only safe with a contract or protection from Allah or from people. They have earned the anger of Allah, and need and poverty has been made to surround them. This is due to their rejection of the signs of Allah, killing the prophets unjustly, and because they rebelled and overstepped the limits of Allah."
"Yet all of them are not alike. Among the people of the Book is a section upright, who recite the scriptures in the hours of the night and bow in adoration and pray,",112,3,لَيْسُوا۟ سَوَآءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ءَانَآءَ ٱلَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ,"Having made clear what many of the People of the Scripture are like, Allah then explains that there is a group among them who are upright and stand by the truth – not all the People of the Scripture are the same. Rather, there is a group among them who follow the Religion of Allah: doing as Allah instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, reading the verses of Allah in the hours of the night, and praying to Him. This group existed before the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent, and became Muslim when they met him and understood his message."
"And believe in God and the Last Day, and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, and who hasten to give in charity: they are among the upright and the doers of good.",113,3,يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"They have certain faith in Allah and the Last Day, instructing what is right and good, and forbidding what is wrong and evil, and they take initiative in doing good actions, taking advantage of the seasons of worship. Such people are from among Allah’s servants who have righteous intentions and actions."
And the good they do will not go unaccepted; for God is aware of those who keep away from evil.,114,3,وَمَا يَفْعَلُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَن يُكْفَرُوهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Whatever good these people do, whether it is little or much, their reward for it will not be lost. Allah knows those who are Mindful, who follow what He instructs, and stay away from what He prohibits. None of what they do is hidden from Him, and they will be rewarded accordingly."
"As for those who disbelieve, neither wealth nor children will avail them in the least against God. They are the residents of Hell where they will live for ever.",115,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَن تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Disbelievers in Allah and His Messenger will not be helped against Allah by their wealth or children: they will not prevent His punishment or bring His mercy to them; rather, their suffering and distress will only increase, and they will be eternally companions of the fire of Hell."
"What they spend in the life of this world is like a frosty wind which smites and destroys the crops of a people who had wronged themselves. God did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.",116,3,مَثَلُ مَا يُنفِقُونَ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَثَلِ رِيحٍ فِيهَا صِرٌّ أَصَابَتْ حَرْثَ قَوْمٍ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَتْهُ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَٰكِنْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"The example of what disbelievers spend in charity, and what they expect to receive of rewards, is like a wind which is extremely cold that hits the crops of a people who wronged themselves by not doing as they were instructed, ruining their crops when they had expected to have a good harvest. Disbelief also ruins the rewards of good deeds. Allah does not wrong them for He is far above any injustice, rather, they wrong themselves through their disbelief in Allah and His prophets."
"O believers, do not make others except your own people your confidants. They will spare no effort to ruin you: They surely desire your annihilation. Hate is on their tongues, and what they hide in their hearts is worse. We have shown you the signs if you have sense.",117,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ بِطَانَةً مِّن دُونِكُمْ لَا يَأْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالًا وَدُّوا۟ مَا عَنِتُّمْ قَدْ بَدَتِ ٱلْبَغْضَآءُ مِنْ أَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَمَا تُخْفِى صُدُورُهُمْ أَكْبَرُ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Prophet, do not take unbelievers as close friends, letting them know your secrets and private business. They will not stop trying to harm you and ruin things for you, wanting what will hurt you and making things really difficult for you. Their hatred and hostility has appeared in what they say; in their criticism of your faith and worship, in incidents between you, and in them giving away your secrets. In their hearts they have even more hatred. Allah has made clear to you what is in your interests in this world and in the Afterlife, if you use your intellect to understand what your Lord has revealed to you."
"Just think! You hold them as your friends but they do not, even though you believe in all the Scriptures. When they meet you they say: ""We believe;"" but when they are alone they bite their fingers in rage. Say: ""Die of your rage. God is aware of the secrets of the hearts.""",118,3,هَٰٓأَنتُمْ أُو۟لَآءِ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِبُّونَكُمْ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْكِتَٰبِ كُلِّهِۦ وَإِذَا لَقُوكُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا۟ عَضُّوا۟ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْأَنَامِلَ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ قُلْ مُوتُوا۟ بِغَيْظِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"It is you, O believers, who love these people, and want goodness for them, but they do not love you, and do not wish you well. Rather, they hate you, while you have faith in all of the scriptures, including their scriptures; yet they do not have faith in the Scripture which Allah revealed to your Prophet. If they meet you they say with their tongues, ‘We have faith’, yet when they are alone together they bite the tips of their fingers in distress and rage because of how united you are, the strength of Islam, and because of their own humiliation and shame. Tell these people, O Prophet, to stay as they are until they die in their rage. Allah knows what faith and disbelief and what good and evil there is in people’s hearts."
"If good comes your way, they are vexed; but if evil befalls you they are pleased and rejoice; yet if you are patient and guard yourselves against evil, their cunning will not harm you in the least, for whatsoever they do is well within the reach of God.",119,3,إِن تَمْسَسْكُمْ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ وَإِن تُصِبْكُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَفْرَحُوا۟ بِهَا وَإِن تَصْبِرُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ لَا يَضُرُّكُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,"If a blessing comes to you in the forms of victory over an enemy, or an increase in wealth or children, then worry and sadness overcomes them; and if a misfortune hits you, such as the victory of an enemy over you, or a decrease in wealth or children, then they are happy, rejoicing at your misfortune. If you are patient with Allah’s commands and decree, and are mindful of not earning Allah’s anger, then their tricks and attempts to hurt you will not harm you. Allah encompasses all their plotting and what they do, and will make them fail."
"Remember when you set forth in the morning from your house assigning the faithful positions for the battle, God heard everything and knew all.",120,3,وَإِذْ غَدَوْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ تُبَوِّئُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مَقَٰعِدَ لِلْقِتَالِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Remember, O Prophet, when some of the believers disobeyed the instruction of Allah and His Messenger, and this happened when you left Medina to fight the idolaters in the Battle of Uḥud, after you had posted the believers in their places for battle, and their positions were clear. Allah hears whatever you say and knows whatever you do."
When two of your bands were about to lose heart God befriended them; and in Him should the faithful place their trust.,121,3,إِذْ هَمَّت طَّآئِفَتَانِ مِنكُمْ أَن تَفْشَلَا وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّهُمَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"Remember, O Prophet, what happened to two groups of the believers from Banī Salamah and Banī Ḥārithah, when they became weak and almost withdrew when the hypocrites drew back; but Allah aided them, making them firm in fighting, and turning them away from what they had been on the edge of doing. So, let those who have faith look to Allah alone for support, no matter what may happen to them."
For God had helped you during the Battle of Badr at a time when you were helpless. So act in compliance with the laws of God; you may well be grateful.,122,3,وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah gave you victory over the idolaters in the Battle of Badr despite your small numbers and resources. Therefore, be Mindful so that you may be thankful for the blessings He has given you."
"Remember when you said to the faithful: ""Is it not sufficient that your Lord should send for your help three thousand angels from the heavens?",123,3,إِذْ تَقُولُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَلَن يَكْفِيَكُمْ أَن يُمِدَّكُمْ رَبُّكُم بِثَلَٰثَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ مُنزَلِينَ,"Remember, O Prophet, when you roused the believers during the battle of Badr, reassuring them after they heard that reinforcements were on their way for the idolaters, by asking whether it was not enough for them that Allah should help them with three thousand angels sent down from Him to reinforce them in the battle."
"Indeed if you are patient and take heed for yourselves, and the (enemy) come rushing at you suddenly your Lord will send even five thousand angels on chargers sweeping down.""",124,3,بَلَىٰٓ إِن تَصْبِرُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ وَيَأْتُوكُم مِّن فَوْرِهِمْ هَٰذَا يُمْدِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُم بِخَمْسَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ مُسَوِّمِينَ,"Indeed, that is enough, and there is good news for you of more aid from Allah if you are courageous in fighting and are Mindful: if the reinforcements of your enemies come rushing at you, then your Lord will help you with five thousand angels, with clear marks on them and their horses."
"And God did not do so but as good tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts for victory comes from God alone, the all-mighty and all-wise --",125,3,وَمَا جَعَلَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا بُشْرَىٰ لَكُمْ وَلِتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُكُم بِهِۦ وَمَا ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلَّا مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"Allah did not tell you of this reinforcement with angels, except as news to please and reassure your hearts. For in fact, victory does not just come through material means, but comes only from Allah the Mighty, Who no one has any authority over, Wise in His decree and sacred laws."
"In order that He may cut off a part of unbelievers or overthrow them, and they turn back in frustration.",126,3,لِيَقْطَعَ طَرَفًا مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَوْ يَكْبِتَهُمْ فَيَنقَلِبُوا۟ خَآئِبِينَ,"Your victory in the Battle of Badr was because Allah willed that a group of the disbelievers be destroyed, and another be humiliated, frustrating them through defeat so that they withdrew."
"You have no say in the matter if He pardon them or punish them, for they are unjust.",127,3,لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ شَىْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"After the believers had been afflicted in the Battle of Uhud, the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed to Allah to destroy the idolaters and some of their leaders. Yet Allah told him that the matter of destruction and punishment lies only with Him alone and that the Prophet has no decision in it. So, be patient until Allah decides between you: either allowing them to repent to Him, asking for forgiveness, so that they are saved; or permitting them to continue in their disbelief, so that they are punished. Those continuing in disbelief are wrongdoers and deserve a punishment."
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: He may pardon whom He please and punish whom He will. Yet God is forgiving and kind.,128,3,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, in its creation and arrangement. He forgives the disobedience of whomever He wills of His servants through His Mercy, and punishes whom He wills through His Justice. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to those who repent to Him."
"O you who believe, do not practice usury, charging doubled and redoubled (interest); but have fear of God: you may well attain your goal.",129,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَأْكُلُوا۟ ٱلرِّبَوٰٓا۟ أَضْعَٰفًا مُّضَٰعَفَةً وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Prophet, stay away from usury: increasing and compounding the wealth that you lend to people as the people of the time of ignorance before Islam did; and be mindful of Allah: following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, so that you may reach the good you desire in this world and in the Afterlife."
Keep away from the Fire prepared for the infidels;,130,3,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,Protect yourselves from the fire of Hell that Allah has prepared for the disbelievers through doing good and staying away from what is prohibited.
"Obey God and the Prophet, that you may be treated with mercy.",131,3,وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"Obey Allah and His Messenger by following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, so that you may gain His mercy in this world and in the Afterlife."
"And hasten for the pardon of your Lord, and for Paradise extending over the heavens and the earth, laid out for those who take heed for themselves and fear God,",132,3,وَسَارِعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Rush to do good actions, and draw near to Allah through doing as He instructs, so that you achieve the great forgiveness of Allah and enter a Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, which Allah has prepared for the Mindful."
"Who expend both in joy and tribulation, who suppress their anger and pardon their fellowmen; and God loves those who are upright and do good,",133,3,ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِى ٱلسَّرَّآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَٱلْكَٰظِمِينَ ٱلْغَيْظَ وَٱلْعَافِينَ عَنِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"The Mindful are those who spend their wealth for the sake of Allah, in ease and hardship, who control their anger when they could seek revenge, and who forgive those who wrong them. Allah loves the doers of good, whose behaviour is this way."
"And those who, if they commit a shameful act or some wrong against themselves, remember God and seek forgiveness for their sins: For who can forgive except God? They should not be perverse about their doings, knowingly.",134,3,وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُوا۟ فَٰحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُوا۟ لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَن يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلُوا۟ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"They are the ones; if they were to commit a major sin, or wrong themselves by committing a lesser sin, they remember Allah, and His warning to the wrongdoers and promise to the Mindful; so they ask their Lord for forgiveness, regretting what they did. They ask Allah not to take them to account for it, because Allah alone can forgive, and they do not continue in their disobedience. They know that they have done wrong and that Allah forgives all disobedience."
"Their recompense is pardon by their Lord, and gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever. How fair is the recompense of those who act!",135,3,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَجَنَّٰتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَٰمِلِينَ,"The Mindful people who are like this, and have these praiseworthy qualities, are rewarded with Allah’s forgiveness and His overlooking what they have done. In the Afterlife, they will have gardens with rivers flowing below palaces, where they will live eternally. How blessed is the reward for those who act according to Allah’s laws!"
There have been many dispensations before you; so travel in the land and see what befell those who denied the truth.,136,3,قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ سُنَنٌ فَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"When the believers were tested by what happened to them on the day of Uḥud, Allah comforted them by saying that what afflicted them was part of the divinely ordained laws of life, i.e. the believers suffering trials at the hands of the disbelievers and overcoming them in the end after their trial. Similar incidents have therefore come to pass in times before them. So, travel the earth and learn from seeing what the fate of those who disbelieved in Allah and His messengers was: their houses are now empty and their power has disappeared."
"This is a clear declaration for mankind, and a guidance and a warning for those who preserve themselves from evil.",137,3,هَٰذَا بَيَانٌ لِّلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةٌ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"This noble Qur’ān is a clarification of the truth, and a warning against what is false, for all people. It shows the path to guidance and the limits for the Mindful, because it is they who benefit from the guidance it contains."
"So do not lose heart or be grieved, for you will surely prevail if you are believers.",138,3,وَلَا تَهِنُوا۟ وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا۟ وَأَنتُمُ ٱلْأَعْلَوْنَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Do not become weak, O believers, and do not be sad about what happened to you on the day of Uḥud. That is not appropriate for you, because you are superior because of your faith, and the uppermost with Allah’s help and the hope of victory, if you have faith in Allah and in His promise to those who are Mindful."
"If you have been wounded they too have suffered a wound. We cause this alternation of night and day in the affairs of men so that God may know those who believe, taking some as witness (of truth) from your ranks, for God does not like those who are unjust.",139,3,إِن يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ ٱلْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِّثْلُهُۥ وَتِلْكَ ٱلْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنكُمْ شُهَدَآءَ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O believers, if you suffered injuries and losses on the day of Uḥud, then the disbelievers also suffered injuries and losses just as you did. Allah distributes such days between people, whether they have faith or disbelieve, giving victory and defeat as He wills, for reasons of great wisdom. Among these reasons is to make it clear, those who truly have faith as opposed to those who are hypocrites, and to honour whomever He wills with martyrdom in His cause. Allah dislikes those who wrong themselves by giving up striving in his path."
This is so that God may try the faithful and destroy the unbelievers.,140,3,وَلِيُمَحِّصَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَيَمْحَقَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"A part of this wisdom of changing fortunes is the purification of those who have faith from their sins, separating them from the hypocrites, and destroying and removing those who reject the truth."
Do you think you will go to Paradise while God does not know who among you strive and persist?,141,3,أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَٰهَدُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Did you think, O believers, that you would enter Paradise before such trials and tests that prove which of you really struggle for the sake of Allah and are patient with the trials they are given?"
You had wished to know death before you faced it (in battle); so now you have seen it before your own eyes.,142,3,وَلَقَدْ كُنتُمْ تَمَنَّوْنَ ٱلْمَوْتَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَلْقَوْهُ فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُمُوهُ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,"O believers, you wished to meet the disbelievers so that you could gain martyrdom for the sake of Allah, like your brothers did on the day of Badr, before you saw the severity and ways of death. Now on the day of Uḥud you have seen what you wished for with your own eyes."
Muhammad is only a messenger; and many a messenger has gone before him. So what if he dies or is killed! Will you turn back and go away in haste? But he who turns back and goes away in haste will do no harm to God. But God will reward those who give thanks (and are grateful).,143,3,وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ ٱلرُّسُلُ أَفَإِي۟ن مَّاتَ أَوْ قُتِلَ ٱنقَلَبْتُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَعْقَٰبِكُمْ وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ ٱللَّهَ شَيْـًٔا وَسَيَجْزِى ٱللَّهُ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"Muhammad is only a Messenger like the messengers of Allah who came before him, who died or were killed. If he were to die or be killed would you turn back from your faith, and stop fighting? Whoever among you turns back from his faith will not harm Allah in any way. He is the Strong, the Victorious. Such a person only harms himself by exposing himself to loss in this world and the Afterlife. Allah will reward those who are thankful to Him by making them firm in their faith and in struggling for His sake."
"No one can die before his appointed term except in accordance with the law of God. And to him who desires a reward in this world, We shall give it; and to him who desires a reward in the life to come, We shall do that. We shall certainly reward those who are grateful.",144,3,وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَن تَمُوتَ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ كِتَٰبًا مُّؤَجَّلًا وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِۦ مِنْهَا وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ نُؤْتِهِۦ مِنْهَا وَسَنَجْزِى ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"No person can die except by the divine decree of Allah, when the time Allah has written for them has come to an end and their set time of death has arrived: their life will not be made longer or shorter. Whoever desires worldly gain through what they do, Allah will give them of it, according to what He has decreed for them, and they will have no share in the Afterlife. Yet whoever desires the reward of Allah in the Afterlife through what they do, Allah will give them its reward, and He will give a great reward to those who are thankful to their Lord."
"Many a seeker after God has fought in the way of God by the side of many an apostle, undaunted (by disaster), and did not disgrace themselves; -- verily God loves those who are steadfast.",145,3,وَكَأَيِّن مِّن نَّبِىٍّ قَٰتَلَ مَعَهُۥ رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ فَمَا وَهَنُوا۟ لِمَآ أَصَابَهُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ضَعُفُوا۟ وَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Many of Allah’s prophets fought with many groups of their followers. They were not cowardly about fighting because of death and wounds that they received for Allah’s sake; and they did not weaken in fighting the enemy or surrender to them, but they were patient and firm. Allah loves those who are patient with hardship and misfortune for His sake."
"Nor did they say aught but: ""O our Lord, forgive us our sins and excesses in our acts, and steady our steps, and help us against unbelieving people.""",146,3,وَمَا كَانَ قَوْلَهُمْ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَإِسْرَافَنَا فِىٓ أَمْرِنَا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"When they were given these trials, these patient people asked Allah to forgive them for their disobedience and for overstepping the limits in what they did, to make their feet firm when they meet their enemy, and to help them against those who disbelieved in Him."
"So God rewarded them in this world, and a better reward awaits them in the next; for God loves those who do good.",147,3,فَـَٔاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَحُسْنَ ثَوَابِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"So, Allah gave them the reward of this life by giving them victory and strength, and gave them the most excellent reward of the Afterlife, where they will receive His favour, and live in bliss eternally in Paradise. Allah loves those who always try to do their best in their worship and transactions."
"O believers, if you listen to the infidels they will make you turn your backs, and you will be the losers.",148,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن تُطِيعُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَعْقَٰبِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُوا۟ خَٰسِرِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, if you obey the disbelieving Jews, Christians and idolaters in the misguidance they instruct you in, then you will return after your faith back to the disbelief you were upon, and you will become losers in this world and in the Afterlife."
"But God is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.",149,3,بَلِ ٱللَّهُ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلنَّٰصِرِينَ,"These disbelievers will not help you if you obey them; rather, Allah is your helper against your enemies. So, obey Him, for He, may He be glorified, is the best of helpers, and you will not need anyone apart from Him."
"We shall strike terror into the hearts of unbelievers for ascribing compeers to God for which He has sent down no sanction. Hell is their residence, the evil abode of the unjust.",150,3,سَنُلْقِى فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلرُّعْبَ بِمَآ أَشْرَكُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِۦ سُلْطَٰنًا وَمَأْوَىٰهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Allah will put great fear in the hearts of the disbelievers, so that they are not able to stand firm to fight you. This is because of worshipping false gods next to Allah, and following their own desires, when no proof has been sent down to them to do so. Their resting place in the Afterlife will be the fire of Hell. What a miserable resting place the fire of Hell is for the wrongdoers!"
"The promise made to you by God was verified when you destroyed (the foe) by His leave, until you were unmanned and disputed the order, and thus disobeyed (the Apostle) even after He had brought you in sight of (victory) you longed for. Some of you desired this world, and some of you the next. Then He put you to flight before (them) in order to try you. But (now) He has forgiven you, for surely God is kind to the faithful.",151,3,وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُۥٓ إِذْ تَحُسُّونَهُم بِإِذْنِهِۦ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَشِلْتُمْ وَتَنَٰزَعْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَمْرِ وَعَصَيْتُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَآ أَرَىٰكُم مَّا تُحِبُّونَ مِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ ثُمَّ صَرَفَكُمْ عَنْهُمْ لِيَبْتَلِيَكُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا عَنكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Allah kept the promise He gave you of victory over your enemies on the day of Uḥud, when you were engaging them in battle, by Allah’s permission, until you became weaker in your resolve to do as the Messenger had commanded you, and you disagreed about whether to stay at your posts or leave them in order to obtain the gains of war. You disobeyed the Messenger’s command to stay at your positions no matter what may happen. This occurred after Allah showed you the victory over your enemies that you wanted so much. Among you are those who desire the goods of this world, and it was those who left their positions; and among you are those who desire the reward of the Afterlife, and it was those who stayed at their positions, obeying the Messenger’s command. Then Allah turned you away from them and gave them power over you so as to test you, and to make clear who were the believers who were patient with trials and who were those who abandoned their positions and became weak. Allah has indeed forgiven you for what you committed when you went against the Messenger’s command, and Allah’s grace for the believers is great: guiding them to faith, forgiving their disobedience, and rewarding them for the difficulties they go through."
"Remember, as you were rushing up (the hill) without turning back to look, though the Prophet was calling you from the rear, He requited you with anguish for an anguish that you do not fret for missed opportunity and what befell you, for God is aware of all that you do,",152,3,إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلَا تَلْوُۥنَ عَلَىٰٓ أَحَدٍ وَٱلرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِىٓ أُخْرَىٰكُمْ فَأَثَٰبَكُمْ غَمًّۢا بِغَمٍّ لِّكَيْلَا تَحْزَنُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلَا مَآ أَصَٰبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Remember, O believers, when you ran away on the day of Uḥud, when failure came upon you because you went against the command of the Messenger. None of you looked at anyone else, and the Messenger called you from behind, between you and the idolaters, saying, ‘Come to me, servants of Allah! Come to me, servants of Allah!’ Allah repaid you for this with pain and distress, followed by pain and distress: first because of the victory and gains of war you lost; and then with the rumour that the Prophet had been killed that spread among you. Later you came to know that the Prophet had not been killed, so that you would not grieve about the victory and gains of war that you lost, or the deaths and wounds that you received, as a way of making misfortune and pain easier on you. Allah is aware of everything you do and of everything in your hearts."
"Then after affliction He Sent you a drowsiness as comes after security, overwhelming some among you, and making some anxious for themselves, and made them think thoughts of pagan ignorance; and they said: ""Have we a say in any affair?"" Say: ""All affairs rest with God."" They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say: ""If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place."" Tell them: ""Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest. God had to try them to bring out what they concealed in their breasts, and to bring out the secrets of their hearts, for God knows your innermost thoughts.",153,3,ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاسًا يَغْشَىٰ طَآئِفَةً مِّنكُمْ وَطَآئِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ يَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ ظَنَّ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَقُولُونَ هَل لَّنَا مِنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ مِن شَىْءٍ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْأَمْرَ كُلَّهُۥ لِلَّهِ يُخْفُونَ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِم مَّا لَا يُبْدُونَ لَكَ يَقُولُونَ لَوْ كَانَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ شَىْءٌ مَّا قُتِلْنَا هَٰهُنَا قُل لَّوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُيُوتِكُمْ لَبَرَزَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَتْلُ إِلَىٰ مَضَاجِعِهِمْ وَلِيَبْتَلِىَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِى صُدُورِكُمْ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ مَا فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Then He sent down on you, after the pain and distress, peace and security. A group among you, who trusted in the promise of Allah, became overcome by sleep because of the peace and serenity in their hearts. Another group were not blessed with security or sleep, and they were the hypocrites, who only worried about their own safety, and felt upset and scared. They thought badly of Allah, thinking that He would not help His Prophet or support His servants, like those of the time of ignorance before Islam did, who did not understand Allah’s reality. These hypocrites said, due to their ignorance of Allah, that they did not have a say in whether they went out to fight; and if they had, they would not have done so. Tell them, O Prophet, in reply, that everything that happens is up to Allah, and that He decreed that they would go out to fight. These hypocrites hide in themselves doubt and bad opinion which they do not show to you, saying that if they had a say in whether they had gone to fight, then people would not have been killed in this place. Tell them, O Prophet, in reply, that if they had been in their houses far from the places of battle and death, those whom Allah had destined to be killed would inevitably go out to the places of their death. Allah only did this to test the intentions and motives in your hearts, and to reveal the faith and hypocrisy in them. Allah knows what is in the hearts of people, and nothing is hidden from Him."
"All those among you who turned their backs on the day the two armies clashed (at 'Uhud) were surely induced by Satan to fail in their duty because of their sinful deeds. But God has already forgiven them, for God is forgiving and kind.",154,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْا۟ مِنكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ إِنَّمَا ٱسْتَزَلَّهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ بِبَعْضِ مَا كَسَبُوا۟ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"Those of you who were defeated, O Companions of Muhammad (peace be upon him), on the day the army of the idolaters and the army of the Muslims met at Uḥud, it was Satan who made you slip, because of what you had earned from doing wrong. Allah has forgiven them, and will not take them to account for it, out of His favour and mercy. Allah forgives those who repent to Him, and is Forbearing, not quick to punish."
"O you who believe, do not be like those who deny, and say of their brethren (who died) travelling in the land or fighting: ""Had they stayed with us here they would not have died or been killed."" This happened so that God may fill their hearts with grief. God is the giver of life and death and sees all that you do.",155,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَقَالُوا۟ لِإِخْوَٰنِهِمْ إِذَا ضَرَبُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ كَانُوا۟ غُزًّى لَّوْ كَانُوا۟ عِندَنَا مَا مَاتُوا۟ وَمَا قُتِلُوا۟ لِيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ذَٰلِكَ حَسْرَةً فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Prophet, do not be like those among the hypocrites who disbelieve, who do not have faith in destiny and Allah’s decree, and who say of their relatives if they travel to earn a living or go out to fight and they die or are killed: If they had stayed with us, and not gone or not fought, then they would not have died or been killed. Allah makes this belief in their hearts increase their regret. Allah alone gives life and death as He wills: staying behind would not stop His decree, and going would not bring it more quickly. Allah sees what you do. None of what you do is hidden from Him and you will be rewarded according to what you do."
"If you are killed in the cause of God or you die, the forgiveness and mercy of God are better than all that you amass.",156,3,وَلَئِن قُتِلْتُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,"If you are killed or die in Allah’s path, O believers, Allah will forgive you and be merciful with you, and that is better than this world along with what the people of this world collect of its passing pleasures."
"And if you die or are killed, even so it is to God that you will return.",157,3,وَلَئِن مُّتُّمْ أَوْ قُتِلْتُمْ لَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"If you die – however you may die – or you are killed in Allah’s path, you will all return to Allah alone, and He will reward you according to what you have done."
"It was through God's mercy that you dealt with them gently; for had you been stern and hard of heart they would surely have broken away from you. So pardon them and pray that forgiveness be theirs, and seek their counsel in all affairs, And when you have come to a decision place your trust in God alone, for He loves those who place their trust in Him.",158,3,فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ ٱلْقَلْبِ لَٱنفَضُّوا۟ مِنْ حَوْلِكَ فَٱعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَمْرِ فَإِذَا عَزَمْتَ فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلِينَ,"Due to Allah’s great mercy, your character, O Prophet, was made to be gentle with your Companions. If you were harsh in your words and actions and hard-hearted, they would have left you. So, pardon them their shortcomings with you and ask Allah to forgive them for what is between them and Allah; and ask their opinion in whatever needs to be agreed upon. Then if you decide on something after agreeing together, then go ahead with it, and trust in Allah. Allah loves those who trust in Him, giving them success and support."
"If God is there to help you none will overcome you; and if He forsake you, who will help you other than Him? So only in God should the faithful place their trust.",159,3,إِن يَنصُرْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَلَا غَالِبَ لَكُمْ وَإِن يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَنصُرُكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"If Allah supports you with His help and aid, then no one can overcome you, even if everyone in the earth came together against you; yet if He does not help or protect you, then no one can help you after Him. Help is in His Hands alone. So let those who have faith depend on Him and on no one else."
It is not for a prophet to be false; and whoever is false will indeed bring his falsehood with him on the Day of Reckoning when each will receive his reward without favour or wrong.,160,3,وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَن يَغُلَّ وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,No of the prophets of Allah would be dishonest and take anything from the gains of war which Allah had not assigned for him. Whoever dishonestly takes something from the gains of war will be repaid by being disgraced on the Day of Judgement: carrying whatever he took in front of creation. Then every soul will be given the total reward of what they earned. No one will be wronged by any addition to their disobedience or by any subtraction from their good actions.
"Is a man who has followed the pleasure of God the same as he who has incurred His wrath, whose abode is surely Hell, a dreadful place?",161,3,أَفَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَنۢ بَآءَ بِسَخَطٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَىٰهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Before Allah, someone who has faith and does good actions that please Allah is not the same as someone who disbelieves and does wrong, earning Allah’s anger and Hell as their resting place. What an awful resting place and destination Hell is!"
"There are different ranks with God, And God sees everything you do.",162,3,هُمْ دَرَجَٰتٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,"They are different in the ranks and levels in the Afterlife: those who follow Allah’s pleasure find their places in Paradise, according to how high their rank in it is; and those who follow what displeases Allah find their places in Hell, according to how low their rank in it is. Allah sees what they do. Nothing is hidden from Him, and everyone will be rewarded according to what they do."
"God has favoured the faithful by sending an apostle to them from among themselves, who recites to them His messages, and reforms and teaches them the Law and the judgement, for they were clearly in error before.",163,3,لَقَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Allah blessed the believers and favoured them when He sent them a messenger from among them, who: recited the Qur’ān to them, purified them from worshipping others next to Allah and from shameful character traits, and taught them the Qur’ān and the ways of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Before this Messenger was sent, they were clearly astray from the right path and guidance."
"How is it that when misfortune befell you, you said: ""Where has this come from?"" -- even though you had inflicted disaster twice as great on (the enemy). Say: ""This has come from your own selves."" Surely God has power over all things.",164,3,أَوَلَمَّآ أَصَٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّىٰ هَٰذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنفُسِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O believers, when disaster struck you at Uḥud, and many of you were killed, and you had beforehand afflicted on your enemies a disaster twice as great in terms of those killed and captured on the day of Badr; why then did you ask where this calamity came from? You claimed that since you are believers and the Prophet of Allah is with you, it should not have occurred. Tell them, O Prophet, that what happened to them came from their own actions and disobedience. Allah is powerful over all things, giving victory to whomever He wills, and leaving whomever He wills"
"What you suffered on the day the two armies had met was by God's dispensation, so that He may distinguish the faithful,",165,3,وَمَآ أَصَٰبَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The death, wounds and defeat you suffered on the day of Uḥud, when your army and the army of the idolaters met, was by the permission and decree of Allah, with far-reaching wisdom behind it: to make it clear who truly had faith."
"And may distinguish the hypocrites who were told: ""Fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves,"" and who had replied: ""If we knew of the fight we would have followed you."" They were nearer unbelief than faith on that day, and they said with their tongues what was not in their hearts; but God is aware of what they hide.",166,3,وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُوا۟ وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا۟ قَٰتِلُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوِ ٱدْفَعُوا۟ قَالُوا۟ لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالًا لَّٱتَّبَعْنَٰكُمْ هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلْإِيمَٰنِ يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَكْتُمُونَ,"And He did this in order to demonstrate who the hypocrites were! When they were told to fight in Allah’s path, or to defend their womenfolk and their people, they said, ‘Had we known that you were going to fight properly, then we would have followed you; but you actually throw yourselves to death!’ At that moment, they were closer to showing their disbelief than their faith, saying with their tongues what was not in their hearts. Allah knows best what they hide in their breasts, and will repay them accordingly."
"To those who sit at home and say of their brothers: ""They would never have been killed had they listened to us, say: ""Drive away death from your midst if what you say is true.""",167,3,ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ لِإِخْوَٰنِهِمْ وَقَعَدُوا۟ لَوْ أَطَاعُونَا مَا قُتِلُوا۟ قُلْ فَٱدْرَءُوا۟ عَنْ أَنفُسِكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Those who stayed behind from fighting, and said of their relatives who suffered on the day of Uḥud that if they had done as they said and not gone to fight then they would not have been killed, tell them, O Prophet, in reply, to keep death away from themselves when it arrives, if they are telling the truth in their claim that they would not have been killed if they had listened to them; and that the reason they themselves escaped death was because they stayed behind from fighting in Allah’s cause."
"Never think that those who are killed in the way of God are dead. They are alive, getting succour from their Lord,",168,3,وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَٰتًۢا بَلْ أَحْيَآءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ,"Do not think, O Prophet, that those who have been killed struggling for the sake of Allah are dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord in His generosity, provided with blessings that we do not know about."
"Rejoicing at what God has given them of His grace, and happy for those who are trying to overtake them but have not joined them yet, and who will have no fear or regret.",169,3,فَرِحِينَ بِمَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَيَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَلْحَقُوا۟ بِهِم مِّنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلَّا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"They are delighted and rejoicing in what Allah has given them from His grace, and looking forward to meeting their brothers who are still on earth. If they are killed during a similar struggle, then they will receive the same grace as them. There is no fear on them in terms of what awaits them in the Afterlife, and no sorrow about any worldly fortunes that passed them by."
They rejoice at the kindness and mercy of God; and God does not suffer the wages of the faithful to go waste.,170,3,يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"They rejoice in the great reward that awaits them from Allah, and the increase of great reward, and that Allah does not let the reward of those who have faith go to waste, but repays it completely, and increases it."
"Those who obeyed the call of God and His Messenger, even after they were wounded, and took heed for themselves, shall indeed have an ample reward,",171,3,ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُوا۟ لِلَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَآ أَصَابَهُمُ ٱلْقَرْحُ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ وَٱتَّقَوْا۟ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Those who responded to the instruction of Allah and His Messenger when they were called to go out and fight for the sake of Allah, and to meet the idolaters in the battle of Ḥamrā’ Al-Asad, which followed the battle of Uḥud, after they had suffered wounds on the day of Uḥud, their wounds did not stop them from responding to the call of Allah and His Messenger. Those of them who acted nobly, and were Mindful in following His instructions and keeping away from what He had prohibited, will have a great reward from Allah: Paradise."
"Those who were told: ""They have gathered an army, beware,"" and their faith increased and they said: ""God is sufficient for us, and the best of protectors,""",172,3,ٱلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُوا۟ لَكُمْ فَٱخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَٰنًا وَقَالُوا۟ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ ٱلْوَكِيلُ,"Some of the idolaters said to them that the Quraysh, led by Abū Sufyān, had come together in great numbers to fight against them and to finish them off, warning them against meeting them. But their words and attempts to scare them only increased their reliance on Allah and their trust in His promise. So they went out to meet them, saying that Allah was enough for them and that He is the best Protector, while committing their lives to Him."
"And returned with God's favour and grace without harm, for they attended the pleasure of God; and great is the benevolence of God.",173,3,فَٱنقَلَبُوا۟ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَّمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوٓءٌ وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ رِضْوَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَظِيمٍ,"They returned from the battle of Ḥamrā’ Al-Asad with a great reward from Allah, an increase in their rank and security from their enemy, whilst suffering no deaths or wounds. They did what pleased Allah, always doing as He instructed and not going against Him; and the grace of Allah for His servants who have faith is great."
"It is no one but Satan who frightens you with his allies. But do not fear him, fear Me, if indeed you are believers.",174,3,إِنَّمَا ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَآءَهُۥ فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"It is only Satan frightening you with his helpers and supporters. Do not fear them, because they have no power or strength; but fear Allah alone, by always doing as He instructs, if you truly have faith in Him."
"And do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief. They do no harm to God; and God will not give them any share in the life to come, and their torment shall be great.",175,3,وَلَا يَحْزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ شَيْـًٔا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَلَّا يَجْعَلَ لَهُمْ حَظًّا فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Do not sorrow, O Messenger, because of those hypocrites who rush to disbelief, turning on their heels. They do not harm Allah in any way, but only harm themselves by distancing themselves from faith in Allah and from doing as He instructs. Allah wills their defeat and failure, and that they will have no portion of bliss in the Afterlife: they will have a great punishment in the fire of Hell."
"Those who barter unbelief for faith, will not harm God in the least, and the punishment for them will be painful.",176,3,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلْإِيمَٰنِ لَن يَضُرُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ شَيْـًٔا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who exchange faith for disbelief will not harm Allah in any way: He is the Mighty and free from any need of His creation. They only harm themselves, and they will have a painful punishment in the Afterlife."
"The unbelievers must not think that the respite We give them augurs well. We do so that they sink deeper into sin, and suffer an ignominious doom.",177,3,وَلَا يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ لِّأَنفُسِهِمْ إِنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُوٓا۟ إِثْمًا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"Those who disbelieve in their Lord and stubbornly resist His sacred law should not think that it is good for them because they are given time and live long, remaining as they are, in disbelief. It is not as they think. They are only given more time to multiply in sin, disobedience upon their disobedience: they will have a humiliating punishment."
"God will not leave the believers in the state they are in till He has sifted the evil from the good; nor will God reveal the secrets of the Unknown. He chooses (for this) from His apostles whom He will. So believe in God and the prophets, for if you believe and fear the displeasure of God your reward will be great.",178,3,مَّا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْغَيْبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْتَبِى مِن رُّسُلِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ فَـَٔامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ فَلَكُمْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Allah would not leave you, O believers, as you are, mixed with the hypocrites with no separation between you, without making it clear those who truly have faith. So He separates you through different obligations and trials, to make clear those who have faith and those who are hypocrites, and to separate the good from the bad. He would not give you knowledge of the Ghaib so that you could distinguish between a believer and a hypocrite; but Allah chooses whomever He wills of His messengers and gives them some knowledge of the Ghaib, as He gave His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) knowledge of the state of the hypocrites. So have faith in Allah and His Messenger; and if you truly have faith and are mindful of Allah, then follow His instructions and stay away from what He has prohibited – so that you gain a great reward from Allah."
"Let not those who are niggardly of things that God has given them of His largesse think that this is good for them. In fact, it is worse; for what they grudged will be hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. To God belong the heavens and the earth, and God is aware of all you do.",179,3,وَلَا يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ بِمَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ هُوَ خَيْرًا لَّهُم بَلْ هُوَ شَرٌّ لَّهُمْ سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَٰثُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"Those who are not generous with the blessings Allah has given them out of His kindness, not fulfilling Allah’s right with it, should not think that this is good for them. Rather, it is bad for them, because whatever they are miserly with will be hung around their necks on the Day of Judgement as a punishment. To Allah alone belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He is the Living after all His creation has passed away. Allah is well aware of the good and evil that you do, and will reward you accordingly."
"God has indeed heard the words of those who said: ""God is a pauper whereas we are rich."" We shall make a note of their words, and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly, and say to them: ""Now taste the agony of burning.""",180,3,لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُوا۟ وَقَتْلَهُمُ ٱلْأَنۢبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ ذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,"Allah certainly heard when the Jews said that Allah was poor, because He asked them for a ‘loan’, and that they were rich because of their wealth. Allah will record this shameful statement in their record of actions along with the eagerness of their ancestors in killing the prophets of Allah on purpose and unjustly. Allah will tell all of them to taste the punishment of burning in the fire of Hell."
"This is (requital) for the deeds you had committed, for God is not unjust to any of His creatures.",181,3,ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,"This punishment is because of the disobedience and disgraceful acts you committed with your own hands, O Jews! Allah does not wrong any of His servants."
"To those who say: ""God has ordained that we should not believe an apostle who does not bring burnt offerings,"" say: ""Many an apostle had come to you before me with manifest proofs, even with what you mention; then why did you kill them if you were men of truth?""",182,3,ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَآ أَلَّا نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَنَا بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ ٱلنَّارُ قُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِى بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَبِٱلَّذِى قُلْتُمْ فَلِمَ قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"They are those who lied in their claim that Allah had instructed them in His scripture and from His prophets to not have faith in a messenger unless he came to them with a charitable offering which fire would then burn from the sky. In their claiming this they also restricted other miraculous signs and evidences the prophets came with. Due to this, Allah instructed His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to ask them why, when messengers had come to them before with clear proofs of the truth of their message, and even with what they had mentioned of an offering burned by fire from the sky, did they reject them and kill them if they were telling the truth!"
"If they call you a liar (remember) so had other apostles been called before you, who had come with clear signs and Scriptures and the Book enlightening.",183,3,فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُو بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,"If they reject you, O Prophet, do not feel saddened, because it is normal for the disbelievers to act like this. Many messengers were rejected before you, who came with clear proofs, and books containing teachings and great wisdom, and the scripture, guiding people through the rulings of the sacred law."
"Every soul will know the taste of death. You will get your recompense in full on the Day of Resurrection; and he who is spared the Fire and finds his way to Paradise will meet his desire. As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity.",184,3,كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ ٱلنَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا مَتَٰعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ,"Every soul, no matter its state, must taste death. No created being should be dazzled by this world. On the Day of Judgement, you will be given the reward for your actions in full, with nothing decreased. Whoever Allah averted from the fire of Hell and granted entry into Paradise, has achieved real success. The life of this world is only a passing enjoyment – only those who are misled become attached to it."
"You will, nonetheless, be tried with your wealth and life, and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former Books and the infidels. But if you endure with patience and follow the straight path, it will surely (accord) with God's fixed resolve about human affairs.",185,3,لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِىٓ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوٓا۟ أَذًى كَثِيرًا وَإِن تَصْبِرُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلْأُمُورِ,"You will certainly be tested, O believers, in your wealth – in relation to fulfilling your duties concerning it – and with the misfortunes sent down with it, and in yourselves with regards to how you conduct yourselves with the orders and prohibitions of the sacred law. Also, you will certainly hear many things from those who were given the scripture before you, and from those who worship others with Allah, that are hurtful to you, criticising you and your sacred way of life. But if you are patient with the misfortunes and trials you are given, and are mindful of Allah, doing what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, then that will lead to the good consequences and it is a matter O believers that requires firm resolve."
"And remember when God took a promise from the people of the Book to make its (truth) known to mankind, and not keep back any part of it, they set aside (the pledge), and sold it away for a little gain but how wretched the bargain that they made!",186,3,وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَٰقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُۥ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُۥ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَٱشْتَرَوْا۟ بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ,"Remember, O Prophet, when Allah took a firm promise from the scholars among the Christians and Jews: that they should make the revelation of Allah clear to people, and not hide the guidance in it, or the evidence of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). But they broke the promise and paid no attention to it, hiding the truth and revealing what was false. They exchanged the promise of Allah for a small price, such as the position or wealth it might buy them. What a terrible price they traded Allah’s promise for!"
"Think not that those who exult at what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape the punishment, for grievous indeed will be their doom.",187,3,لَا تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أَتَوا۟ وَّيُحِبُّونَ أَن يُحْمَدُوا۟ بِمَا لَمْ يَفْعَلُوا۟ فَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّهُم بِمَفَازَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Do not think, O Prophet, that those who rejoice in the shameful actions they have committed, and who love people to praise them for good things which they did not do, are secure and safe from the punishment. Rather, Hell is their place, and they will have a painful punishment."
"For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God's is the power over all things.",188,3,وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,With Allah alone is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them: in its creation and administration. Allah is powerful over all things.
"In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, are signs for the wise.",189,3,إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"In the creation of the heavens and the earth, from nothing with no precedent, and in the following of the night and day, and the difference in their length, are clear signs for those of understanding, which lead them to the Creator of the universe, worthy alone of worship."
"Those who honour God in meditation, standing or sitting or lying on their sides, who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say) ""Not in vain have You made them. All praise be to You, O Lord, preserve us from the torment of Hell.",190,3,ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَٰمًا وَقُعُودًا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَٰطِلًا سُبْحَٰنَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,"Those who remember Allah in all conditions – standing, sitting and lying on their sides – and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying that their Lord did not originate this wonderful creation without a reason, and is far above that, and ask Him to protect them from the punishment of the fire of Hell, by enabling them to do good and protecting them from doing wrong – they say:"
"Whoever, O Lord, should be cast into Hell shall be verily disgraced; and the sinners shall have none to help (or save) them.",191,3,رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ مَن تُدْخِلِ ٱلنَّارَ فَقَدْ أَخْزَيْتَهُۥ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ,"Our Lord, whoever You enter into the fire of Hell from your creation has been humiliated and disgraced. On the Day of Judgement, the wrongdoers will have no helpers to protect them from Allah’s punishment and repayment."
"We have heard, O our Lord, the crier call inviting us to faith (and announcing): 'Believe in your Lord.' O our Lord, to faith we have come, so forgive our trespasses, deliver us from sin, and grant us (the glory of) death with the just.",192,3,رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّنَا سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِيًا يُنَادِى لِلْإِيمَٰنِ أَنْ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَـَٔامَنَّا رَبَّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّـَٔاتِنَا وَتَوَفَّنَا مَعَ ٱلْأَبْرَارِ,"Our Lord, we have heard a caller to faith saying, ‘Have faith in your Lord’. So we responded to him and have faith in what he calls us to and we follow the sacred law, so forgive us our sins and do not disgrace us; and do not take us to account for our bad actions. Let us die with the righteous; and enable us to do good and stay away from disobedience."
"Give us what You promised, O Lord, through Your prophets; and put us not to shame on the Day of Reckoning, for never do You go back on Your promise.""",193,3,رَبَّنَا وَءَاتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلَا تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّكَ لَا تُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"Our Lord, give us guidance and the help in this world that You promised us through the words of Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Judgement by entering us into the fire of Hell. Our Lord, You are generous and never do You break Your promise."
"The Lord heard their prayer and answered: ""I suffer not the good deeds of any to go waste, be he a man or a woman: The one of you is of the other. And those who were deprived of their homes or banished in My cause, and who fought and were killed, I shall blot out their sins and admit them indeed into gardens with rippling streams."" -- A recompense from God, and the best of rewards is with God.",194,3,فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّى لَآ أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَٰمِلٍ مِّنكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ بَعْضُكُم مِّنۢ بَعْضٍ فَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ وَأُخْرِجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَأُوذُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِى وَقَٰتَلُوا۟ وَقُتِلُوا۟ لَأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ وَلَأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ ثَوَابًا مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُۥ حُسْنُ ٱلثَّوَابِ,"So their Lord responded to their prayer, saying that He does not allow the reward of anything you do, small or big, to be lost, whether the person who does it is male or female. You are from one another in your origins, and the faith that you follow does not reward males and females differently. Those who emigrated for the sake of Allah (driven from their homes by the disbelievers), suffered harm in order to obey their Lord, and who fought for the sake of Allah and died so that the Word of Allah would be supreme, they will certainly be forgiven their sins on the Day of Judgement: it will be overlooked, and they will be entered into gardens with rivers flowing under their palaces, as a reward from Allah – with Allah is the best reward, unlike any other."
Be not deceived by the comings and goings of unbelievers in the land.,195,3,لَا يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْبِلَٰدِ,"O Prophet, do not feel burdened nor distressed by the movement of the disbelievers in the land, and their power and the extent of their trade and provision. All of this is passing, and all that they will have left is their bad deeds."
"Their commerce is but short-lived, and then their abode shall be Hell: And what an evil abode!",196,3,مَتَٰعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,This world is a brief enjoyment that does not last. The destination they will return to on the Day of Judgement will be Hell – what a terrible resting place the fire of Hell is for them!
"But those who are pious and obedient to their Lord, will have gardens with streams of running water where they will abide as guests of God; and what is with God is best for the pious.",197,3,لَٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلًا مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلْأَبْرَارِ,"Yet those who are mindful of their Lord, following His instructions and staying away from what He has prohibited, they will receive gardens with rivers flowing under their palaces, where they shall live eternally – a reward prepared for them from Allah. What Allah has prepared for the righteous is better than any of the worldly pleasures the disbelievers may have obtained."
"Certainly among the people of the Book are some who believe in God and in what has been revealed to you and had been revealed to them; and they bow in humility before God, and do not trade for paltry gain the signs of God. Their reward is verily with their Lord; and swift is the reckoning of God!",198,3,وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ خَٰشِعِينَ لِلَّهِ لَا يَشْتَرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Nevertheless, the People of the Scripture are not all the same. There is a group among them who have faith in Allah, the truth and guidance He revealed to you and what was revealed to them in their scriptures; and they do not discriminate between the messengers of Allah, but humble themselves before Him, desiring what is with Him, and not exchanging His verses and signs for a small enjoyment in this world. Such people will have a great reward with their Lord. Allah is quick to take account of what people do, and quick to reward them."
"So you who believe, have endurance in suffering, be patient and persevere, strengthen each other and be firm, and be pious and fear God that you may find success.",199,3,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱصْبِرُوا۟ وَصَابِرُوا۟ وَرَابِطُوا۟ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, be patient with the obligations of the sacred law, and with the misfortunes that you are given in this world; and outdo the disbelievers in patience and determination, so that they are not more patient than you; and struggle for the sake of Allah and be Mindful, following His instructions and staying away from what He has prohibited, so that you may reach what you desire of safety from the fire of Hell and entry into Paradise."
"O MEN, FEAR your Lord who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, and from the two of them dispersed men and women (male and female) in multitudes. So fear God in whose name you ask of one another (the bond of) relationships. God surely keeps watch over you.",0,4,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَآءً وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِى تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِۦ وَٱلْأَرْحَامَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا,"O people, be mindful of your Lord, for it is He Who created you from a single soul: your father Adam; and from Adam He created his wife Eve, your mother. From the two of them, He spread many people, both male and female, all over the earth. Be mindful of Allah when requesting others by Him, such as: ‘I ask you, by Allah, to do such-and-such. Also, be mindful of breaking relations with your blood ties. Allah watches over you and nothing you do escapes Him; rather, He takes it into account and repays you accordingly."
"Give to the orphans their possessions, and do not replace things of your own which are bad with things which are good among theirs, and do not intermix their goods with your own and make use of them, for this is a grievous crime.",1,4,وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰٓ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ وَلَا تَتَبَدَّلُوا۟ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بِٱلطَّيِّبِ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوٓا۟ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ حُوبًا كَبِيرًا,"Guardians, give orphans (whose fathers have died and who have not yet reached maturity) their wealth in full when they come of age and have sound judgement. Do not exchange what is permitted for what is prohibited: taking what is good and valuable from the property of the orphans and replacing it with something bad and of little worth from your own property. Also, do not take the property of the orphans and combine it with your own wealth – that is a great crime before Allah."
"If you fear you cannot be equitable to orphan girls (in your charge, or misuse their persons), then marry women who are lawful for you, two, three, or four; but if you fear you cannot treat so many with equity, marry only one, or a maid or captive. This is better than being iniquitous.",2,4,وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تُقْسِطُوا۟ فِى ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ فَٱنكِحُوا۟ مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا۟ فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَلَّا تَعُولُوا۟,"If you fear that you will not be just in marrying the female orphans under your guardianship – fearing that you will not give them an appropriate dowry or will not treat them well – then do not marry them, and marry other women you choose. You may marry two, three or four; but if you fear that you will be unjust between them, then marry just one, or suffice with what you possess of slave women, for their rights are not the same as the rights of wives. This is the best way to avoid being unjust or biased."
"Give to women their dowers willingly, but if they forego part of it themselves, then use it to your advantage.",3,4,وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلنِّسَآءَ صَدُقَٰتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْسًا فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيٓـًٔا مَّرِيٓـًٔا,"Give women their dowries with good will. Yet if they gladly give up a part of the dowry to you, of their own free will, then there is nothing to stop you enjoying it."
"Do not entrust (their) property God has given you to maintain (On trust), to those who are immature; but feed them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kindness.",4,4,وَلَا تُؤْتُوا۟ ٱلسُّفَهَآءَ أَمْوَٰلَكُمُ ٱلَّتِى جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ قِيَٰمًا وَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ فِيهَا وَٱكْسُوهُمْ وَقُولُوا۟ لَهُمْ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا,"Guardians, do not give property to those who do not know how to manage it well. Allah made this property a way to serve the interests of people and for them to live on it, and such people are not able to manage their wealth well. Provide for them, clothe them and speak to them in a good way. Make a firm commitment to give them their property if they get sound judgement and become able to manage it well."
"And test (and try) the orphans until they are of marriageable age. If you find they have acquired sound judgement, then hand over their property to them; but devour not their wealth, nor use it up hastily out of fear that soon they will grow up (and demand it). And (the guardian) who is rich should abstain from spending much (of their wealth); and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair. And when you give back their possessions have this witnessed, (and remember) that God is sufficient to take all account.",5,4,وَٱبْتَلُوا۟ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافًا وَبِدَارًا أَن يَكْبَرُوا۟ وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيًّا فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيبًا,"Guardians, test the orphans when they are near to reaching maturity, by giving them a part of their wealth to see how they manage it. If they manage it well, and show you their sound judgement, hand over their property in full. Do not use up their wealth, overstepping the limits which Allah has approved for you: use their wealth only when necessary. Do not rush to use it up for fear that they will take it when they reach maturity. Whoever is wealthy should not use up the property of the orphan; and whoever is poor and has no wealth should only use what is necessary. When you hand over their property to them, upon their reaching maturity and showing sound judgement, have it witnessed; to protect rights and to prevent causes of disagreement. Allah is sufficient as a witness for that, and takes account of all that people do."
Men have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind at death; and women have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind. Be it large or small a legal share is fixed.,6,4,لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبُونَ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبُونَ مِمَّا قَلَّ مِنْهُ أَوْ كَثُرَ نَصِيبًا مَّفْرُوضًا,"Men are to have a share of what their parents or relatives – such as brothers and sisters or uncles and aunts – leave when they die, whether it is much or little. Women are also to have a share of what they leave, which was not the way that things were in the time of ignorance before Islam, when women and children were left out of the inheritance. This share is a right and its amount is clearly set out – as made obligatory by Allah."
"And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them.",7,4,وَإِذَا حَضَرَ ٱلْقِسْمَةَ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينُ فَٱرْزُقُوهُم مِّنْهُ وَقُولُوا۟ لَهُمْ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا,"If relatives, orphans and the poor, who do not inherit, are present at the time the inheritance is divided, then give them, out of kindness, some of this wealth before it is divided, for they may be looking at it with desire for a share; and it came to you without you doing anything. Also, speak to them in a kind way, without any meanness."
"Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them.",8,4,وَلْيَخْشَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُوا۟ مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّةً ضِعَٰفًا خَافُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ فَلْيَتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَلْيَقُولُوا۟ قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا,"Let those executors and guardians fear in the manner they would if they had died and left young, weak children behind them, fearing they would be ruined. Let them be mindful of orphans under their guardianship, not doing any wrong to them. So that Allah brings about others to treat well their own children after they die, as they treated the orphans well. Let whoever is present at the making of will, say what is right for the children, so that the heirs are not wronged in the will. Nor should the giver deprive himself of this good deed by not leaving a will."
"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell.",9,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَٰلَ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِى بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا,"Those who take the property of orphans and spend it wrongly and unjustly, they only swallow fire into themselves: they will burn in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement."
"As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females. If they consist of women only, and of them more than two, they will get two-thirds of the inheritance; but in case there is one, she will inherit one half. The parents will each inherit a sixth of the estate if it happens the deceased has left a child; but if he has left no children, and his parents are his heirs, then the mother will inherit one-third; but if he has left brothers, the mother will inherit one-sixth after payment of legacies and debts. Of parents and children you do not know who are more useful to you. These are the decrees of God who knows all and is wise.",10,4,يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَٰحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ وَلِأَبَوَيْهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَوَرِثَهُۥٓ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُۥٓ إِخْوَةٌ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُ مِنۢ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِى بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَآؤُكُمْ لَا تَدْرُونَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ لَكُمْ نَفْعًا فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"Allah instructs you in the matter of the inheritance of children that the inheritance should be divided between them. A son gets a share equal to the share of two daughters. If the person who died left daughters without a son, two daughters or more get two thirds of what is left. If there is just one daughter, she gets a half of what is left. For each of the parents of the person who has died, they get a sixth of what is left, if he has children. If he does not have children or any heir except for his parents, then the mother gets a third, and the father gets the rest. If the person who has died has two or more siblings, whether brothers, sisters, half-brothers, or half-sisters, then his mother gets a sixth as a share, and the father gets the rest – so the brothers and sisters are not given anything. This division of the inheritance is after the bequests of the will have been deducted, with the condition that the bequests in the will cannot be more than a third of the total wealth and debts have been repaid from the wealth. Allah has made the division of inheritance like this because you do not know whether your parents or your children are closer to you in benefit in this world and the next. For instance, a person may think well of someone and leave everything to them, or think badly of someone and not leave them anything, and they may be wrong in their opinion in both cases. Allah knows the reality of things and nothing is hidden from Him. For this reason, the division of inheritance is as He made clear, and He made it obligatory for His servants. Allah knows everything, and nothing is hidden from Him of what is good for His servants – He is Wise in His sacred law and administration."
"Your share in the property the wives leave behind is half if they die without an issue, but in case they have left children, then your share is one-fourth after the payment of legacies and debts; and your wife shall inherit one-fourth of what you leave at death if you die childless, if not, she will get one-eighth of what you leave behind after payment of legacies and debts. If a man or a woman should die without leaving either children or parents behind but have brother and sister, they shall each inherit one-sixth. In case there are more, they will share one-third of the estate after payment of legacies and debts without prejudice to others. This is the decree of God who knows all and is kind.",11,4,وَلَكُمْ نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزْوَٰجُكُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَلَكُمُ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْنَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِينَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَلَهُنَّ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ ٱلثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ تُوصُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَوِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُۥٓ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَآءُ فِى ٱلثُّلُثِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ غَيْرَ مُضَآرٍّ وَصِيَّةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ,"You have half of what your wives leave, if they have no child. If they have a child, whether it is your child or not, then you get a fourth of the wealth they leave, after any bequest they have made and the repayment of any debts they had. Wives get a quarter of what you leave, if you have no child, whether it is their child or not. If you have a child, then they get an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you have made and the repayment of any debts you had. If someone dies without any parents or children to inherit from them, but they have a brother or sister from the same mother as them, then each of them gets a sixth. If they have more than one brother or sister from the same mother as them, then they share a third, with brothers and sisters receiving the same share – this is after any bequest that they leave and the repayment of any debts they had, with the condition that the bequest does not cause harm to any of the inheritors, such as it being more than a third of the total of the wealth. The rulings contained in the verses about inheritance law are an obligation on you, and Allah knows what is in the interests of His servants in this world and the Afterlife. He is forbearing, and not quick to punish."
"These are the limits set by God, and those who follow the commandments of God and the Prophet, will indeed be admitted to gardens with streams of water running by, where they will for ever abide; and this will be success supreme.",12,4,تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"The rulings regarding orphans and other matters mentioned above are the sacred laws of Allah, which Allah has given to His servants to follow. Whoever follows Allah and His Messenger in His instructions, staying away from what He has prohibited, Allah will enter them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath their palaces, where they will live eternally. That divine reward is the great success, which no other success comes near to."
"Those who disobey God and the Prophet and exceed the bounds of law, will be taken to Hell and abide there for ever and shall suffer despicable punishment.",13,4,وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُۥ يُدْخِلْهُ نَارًا خَٰلِدًا فِيهَا وَلَهُۥ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"Whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, by not following His laws or doubting them, and overstepping the limits He has made, He will enter them into a fire where they will remain – for them is a humiliating punishment there."
"If any of your women is guilty of unnatural offence, bring four of your witnesses to give evidence; if they testify against them, retain them in the houses until death overtakes them or God provides some other way for them.",14,4,وَٱلَّٰتِى يَأْتِينَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ فَٱسْتَشْهِدُوا۟ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنكُمْ فَإِن شَهِدُوا۟ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ فِى ٱلْبُيُوتِ حَتَّىٰ يَتَوَفَّىٰهُنَّ ٱلْمَوْتُ أَوْ يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُنَّ سَبِيلًا,"For those of your women who commit sexual offences – whether they are married or unmarried – call four trustworthy Muslim men witnesses. If they bear witness against them, then confine them to their homes as a punishment, until the end of their lives, or until Allah makes a way for them other than being confined. The ruling of this verse was replaced with the ruling that unmarried women who have illicit sexual relations should be whipped a hundred times and banished for a year, and married women who have illicit sexual relations should be stoned."
"If two (men) among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them. But if they repent and reform, let them be, for God accepts repentance and is merciful.",15,4,وَٱلَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَٰنِهَا مِنكُمْ فَـَٔاذُوهُمَا فَإِن تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُوا۟ عَنْهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا,"If two of your men commit a sexual offence – whether they are married or unmarried – punish them with words and blows, humiliating and disciplining them. If they turn away from what they were doing and correct themselves, then do not harm them. Those who turn away from a sin and ask for forgiveness are like those who have not sinned. Allah turns to those who repent to Him asking for forgiveness, and is Compassionate with them. The ruling of this verse was replaced with the ruling that unmarried men who have illicit sexual relations should be whipped a hundred times and banished for a year, and married men who have illicit sexual relations should be stoned."
"God does accept repentance, but only of those who are guilty of an evil out of ignorance yet quickly repent, and God turns to them again, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",16,4,إِنَّمَا ٱلتَّوْبَةُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسُّوٓءَ بِجَهَٰلَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِن قَرِيبٍ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"Allah only turns in mercy and forgiveness to those who commit disobedience and overstep the limits out of foolishness and impulse, and who repent to Allah asking for His forgiveness before the time of their death. Allah forgives these people, by overlooking their disobedience. Allah knows the circumstances of people, and is Wise in His decree and sacred laws."
"But (He does not accept) the repentance of those who continue indulging in evil until death draws near and they say: ""We now repent;"" nor of those who die disbelieving. For them We have a grievous retribution in wait.",17,4,وَلَيْسَتِ ٱلتَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّى تُبْتُ ٱلْـَٰٔنَ وَلَا ٱلَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"Allah does not turn in mercy and forgiveness to those who continue in their disobedience, overstepping the limits and insisting on overstepping them, and not turning away from doing this until they are dying, then saying that they regret what they did and asking for Allah’s forgiveness. Also, Allah does not turn in mercy and forgiveness to those who die in disbelief – He has prepared a painful punishment for them."
"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.",18,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُوا۟ ٱلنِّسَآءَ كَرْهًا وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا۟ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّآ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰٓ أَن تَكْرَهُوا۟ شَيْـًٔا وَيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, you are not allowed to inherit the wives of your fathers in the way wealth is inherited or marry them, or give them in marriage, or stop them from marrying. Also, it is forbidden for you to retain your wives who you do not like in order to get them to give back some of what you gave to them, unless they have had illegal sexual relations. In that case, you can get them to return what you gave them. Be good companions to your women, not hurting them, and be kind to them. If you do not like them for some worldly reason, then be patient with them. Allah may put much good in what you do not like, both in the life of this world and in the Afterlife."
"If you want to take another wife in place of the one you are married to, then even if you have given her a talent of gold, do not take back a thing. Would you take it away by slandering and using unjust means?",19,4,وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمُ ٱسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَّكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَءَاتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَىٰهُنَّ قِنطَارًا فَلَا تَأْخُذُوا۟ مِنْهُ شَيْـًٔا أَتَأْخُذُونَهُۥ بُهْتَٰنًا وَإِثْمًا مُّبِينًا,"If you want to divorce a woman and replace her with another, then you are allowed to do so; but if you gave the one you intend to divorce a great deal of wealth as a dowry, then you are not allowed to take anything back from it. Taking back what you gave to them would be an injustice and a clear sin."
"How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?",20,4,وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُۥ وَقَدْ أَفْضَىٰ بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَأَخَذْنَ مِنكُم مِّيثَٰقًا غَلِيظًا,"How could you take what you gave to them as a dowry after the relationship, love, enjoyment and sharing of secrets that has occurred between you? Greed for the wealth which is theirs after all this is forbidden and shameful. They took a sincere promise from you, by which they became lawful to you through the Word of Allah and His sacred law."
"And do not wed the women your fathers had wed. What happened in the past is now past: It was lewd and abhorrent, and only the way of evil.",21,4,وَلَا تَنكِحُوا۟ مَا نَكَحَ ءَابَآؤُكُم مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَٰحِشَةً وَمَقْتًا وَسَآءَ سَبِيلًا,"Do not marry women whom your fathers married. That is forbidden, unless it happened before in the time of ignorance, in which case you will not be taken to account for it. Sons marrying the wives of their fathers is a shameful practice, a cause for earning Allah’s anger."
"Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters, and foster mothers, foster sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and the daughters of the wives you have slept with who are under your charge; but in case you have not slept with them there is no offence (if you marry their daughters); and the wives of your own begotten sons; and marrying two sisters is unlawful. What happened in the past (is now past): God is forgiving and kind.",22,4,حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أُمَّهَٰتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُكُمْ وَأَخَوَٰتُكُمْ وَعَمَّٰتُكُمْ وَخَٰلَٰتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُ ٱلْأَخِ وَبَنَاتُ ٱلْأُخْتِ وَأُمَّهَٰتُكُمُ ٱلَّٰتِىٓ أَرْضَعْنَكُمْ وَأَخَوَٰتُكُم مِّنَ ٱلرَّضَٰعَةِ وَأُمَّهَٰتُ نِسَآئِكُمْ وَرَبَٰٓئِبُكُمُ ٱلَّٰتِى فِى حُجُورِكُم مِّن نِّسَآئِكُمُ ٱلَّٰتِى دَخَلْتُم بِهِنَّ فَإِن لَّمْ تَكُونُوا۟ دَخَلْتُم بِهِنَّ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَحَلَٰٓئِلُ أَبْنَآئِكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَٰبِكُمْ وَأَن تَجْمَعُوا۟ بَيْنَ ٱلْأُخْتَيْنِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"Allah has prohibited you to marry your mothers and grandmothers, your daughters and granddaughters, your sisters and half-sisters, your aunts and great aunts, your nieces and their children, your milk-mothers who nursed you and your sisters through nursing, the mothers of your wives (whether you have consummated the marriage or not), and the daughters of your wives by someone else (who were mostly raised in your houses, and also those who were not, if you have consummated the marriage; but if you have not, then there is nothing wrong with marrying their daughters). You are also prohibited to marry those who have been married to your own sons, even if they did not consummate the marriage, and this includes the wives of your sons through milk-kinship (nursing). It is prohibited for you to marry two sisters who are related by blood or by nursing, except if this happened in the time of ignorance before Islam, in which case Allah has forgiven it. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate to His servants who repent to Him. In the traditions of the Prophet it is also confirmed that it is prohibited to marry a woman and her aunt at the same time."
"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry. God is certainly all-knowing and all-wise.",23,4,وَٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتُ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلَّا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُم مَّا وَرَآءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَن تَبْتَغُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِكُم مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحِينَ فَمَا ٱسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهِۦ مِنْهُنَّ فَـَٔاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَٰضَيْتُم بِهِۦ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْفَرِيضَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"Those who are already married are prohibited to you, except those who you have captured whilst fighting in Allah’s cause: they are allowed to you after making sure they are not pregnant – this is what Allah has decreed. All women other than those who have been prohibited are allowed for you, if you seek them with your wealth, in a chaste way, desiring what is lawful and not desiring sexual immorality. Give those you enjoy in marriage their dowry, which Allah has made an obligation on you. However, there is nothing wrong if you mutually agree, after the obligation of the dowry has been set, to increase it, or to give up part of it. Allah knows His creation and nothing about them is hidden from Him. He is Wise in His administration and in His sacred law-giving."
"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry. They are women (seeking) wedlock, and not lechery, nor secretly looking for paramours. But if they are married and guilty of adultery, inflict on them half the punishment (enjoined) for gentlewomen. This is for those who are afraid of doing wrong. In case they can wait, it is better for them. God is forgiving and kind.",24,4,وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلًا أَن يَنكِحَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ فَمِن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُم مِّن فَتَيَٰتِكُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَٰنِكُم بَعْضُكُم مِّنۢ بَعْضٍ فَٱنكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذْنِ أَهْلِهِنَّ وَءَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ مُحْصَنَٰتٍ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحَٰتٍ وَلَا مُتَّخِذَٰتِ أَخْدَانٍ فَإِذَآ أُحْصِنَّ فَإِنْ أَتَيْنَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ فَعَلَيْهِنَّ نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ ٱلْعَنَتَ مِنكُمْ وَأَن تَصْبِرُوا۟ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Whoever among you cannot marry a free woman, because he does not have enough wealth, is allowed to marry a believing slave owned by someone else. Allah knows the reality of your faith and your situation, and you are equal in your faith and humanity, so do not look down on marrying them. Marry them with the permission of their owners, and give them their dowries without reducing the amount or delaying it. This is if they are chaste and do not commit sexual offences publicly and do not take lovers secretly. If you marry them and then they have illicit sexual relations, their punishment is half that of a free woman: fifty lashes, and not stoning, which is the punishment for chaste women. Marrying chaste believing slave women is a concession for those who fear falling into illicit sexual relations, and who are not able to marry free women. Patience is preferable to marrying slave women though, so that the children do not become slaves. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate to those of His servants who repent to Him, and it is from His mercy that He allowed marriage to slaves in the case of not being able to marry free women, for those who fear falling into illicit sexual relations."
"God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people, and to forgive you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",25,4,يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ سُنَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَيَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Through these rulings, Allah – may He be glorified – wishes to make clear to you His sacred law and way of life, and what is in your interests in this world and in the Afterlife. He wishes to guide you to the ways of the prophets before you in allowing things and prohibiting them, and to their noble qualities, and praiseworthy behaviour, so you can follow them. He wishes to return you from disobedience to following Him. Allah knows what is in the interests of His servants, and makes His laws accordingly; and He is Wise in His sacred laws and in managing their lives."
"God likes to turn to you, but those who are lost in the pleasures of the flesh wish to turn you astray, far away.",26,4,وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ أَن تَمِيلُوا۟ مَيْلًا عَظِيمًا,"Allah wants to turn to you and forgive you your disobedience, while those who follow their low desires want you to turn far away from the correct way of life."
"God would like to lighten your burden, for man was created weak.",27,4,يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنكُمْ وَخُلِقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ ضَعِيفًا,"Allah wants to make things easy for you in His sacred law. He does not burden you with more than you are able to do, because He knows the weakness of human beings in their creation and nature."
"O believers, you should not usurp unjustly the wealth of each other, but trade by mutual consent; and do not destroy yourselves. God is merciful to you.",28,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَأْكُلُوٓا۟ أَمْوَٰلَكُم بَيْنَكُم بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنكُمْ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not take the money of others unjustly, by force, stealing, bribery or by any other unjust means. Instead, money should come from trade through mutual agreement and goodwill between the seller and buyer. In this way, it is lawful for you to enjoy and use such money. Do not kill one another, and do not kill yourselves, and do not throw yourselves to ruin. Allah is Compassionate with you, and from His mercy He makes these laws."
"If someone does so through oppression or injustice, We shall cast him into Hell: This is how (the Law of) God works inevitably.",29,4,وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ عُدْوَٰنًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرًا,"Whoever does the things which Allah has prohibited – taking the money of others, or wronging himself by killing and the like, doing wrong knowingly, and not doing it out of ignorance or forgetfulness – Allah will enter them into a great fire on the Day of Judgement, where they will suffer its burning heat and receive their punishment. That is easy for Allah, because He is powerful over everything."
"If you keep away from the deadly sins that have been forbidden, We shall efface your faults, and lead you to a place of honour.",30,4,إِن تَجْتَنِبُوا۟ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُم مُّدْخَلًا كَرِيمًا,"O believers, if you avoid the major sins, such as worshipping others gods with Allah, disrespecting your parents, killing, and receiving interest on loans, then Allah will forgive you for smaller sins, wiping them out and erasing them. Then Allah will enter you into a noble place near to Him: Paradise."
"Do not covet what God has favoured some with more than He has some others. Men have a share in what they earn, and women have theirs in what they earn. Ask God for His favours. Surely God has knowledge of everything.",31,4,وَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْا۟ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُوا۟ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ وَسْـَٔلُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا,"O believers, do not wish for what Allah favours some of you over others with, so that this does not lead to resentment and envy. Women should not wish for what Allah has given to men in particular: for men is a share from what they do, and for women is a share from what they do – neither of them is rewarded except through what they earn. Ask Allah to answer your prayers out of His favour to you. Allah knows all things. In His wisdom, He gives and withholds."
"For each We have appointed heirs to what parents and relatives leave behind. And to those you have given your pledge in marriage give their share, for God is witness to everything.",32,4,وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَٰلِىَ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ فَـَٔاتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدًا,"For every one of you I have made relations to inherit from what parents and relatives leave in their inheritance; and for those who you have made a promise of allegiance with as an ally and helper, give them their share of the inheritance. I am a witness to everything, and I witness your oaths and promises. The ally inheriting was a ruling at the beginning of Islam, but this ruling was later replaced."
"Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing). If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them. Surely God is sublime and great.",33,4,ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلَّٰتِى تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِى ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضْرِبُوهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا۟ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا,"Men are responsible for women, protecting and taking care of them, because of the bounty He has given men over them, and because of their duty to maintain and take care of them. Righteous women are devoted to their Lord, and devoted to their husbands, protecting things for them in their absence through Allah’s help. The women who you fear would not show devotion to their husbands in what they say or do, first remind them of how they should act according to the sacred laws; if they do not change their ways, then leave them alone in bed, turning your back to them and not having sexual relations; and if they still do not change their ways, then strike them without any ferocity. If they become loyal again, then do not do anything against them, not wronging them nor blaming them. Allah is High in His essence, Great in His attributes, so be mindful of Him."
"If you fear a breach between them, appoint one arbiter from the people of the man and one from the people of the woman. If they wish to have a settlement then God will reconcile them, for God is all-knowing and cognisant.",34,4,وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَٱبْعَثُوا۟ حَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهِۦ وَحَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن يُرِيدَآ إِصْلَٰحًا يُوَفِّقِ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا خَبِيرًا,"If you fear that a disagreement between the two of them is leading to aggression and incompatibility, then send a just man from the family of the husband, and a just man from the family of the wife to judge what the benefits of them separating or staying together might be. Staying together is preferable and better. If the two judges want this, using the best methods to get them back together, then Allah will make them come to an understanding, and the argument between them will be resolved. Allah is Knowing. Nothing about His creatures is hidden from Him, and He is Aware of what they hide in their hearts."
"Pay homage to God, and make none His compeer, and be good to your parents and relatives, the orphans and the needy and the neighbours who are your relatives, and the neighbours who are strangers, and the friend by your side, the traveller and your servants and subordinates. God does not surely love those who are arrogant and boastful,",35,4,وَٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا۟ بِهِۦ شَيْـًٔا وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَٰنًا وَبِذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْجَارِ ذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْجَارِ ٱلْجُنُبِ وَٱلصَّاحِبِ بِٱلْجَنۢبِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالًا فَخُورًا,"Worship Allah alone faithfully and do not worship next to Him anything else. Be good to your parents, honouring them and treating them with respect, and be good to relatives, orphans and the poor. Be good to the neighbour who is a relative and the neighbour who is not a relative; the friend you spend time with; the traveller who is a stranger and has no means whereby to complete his journey; and to slaves. Allah does not like those who think too much of themselves and are arrogant with people, and praise themselves as a way of boasting."
"Who are miserly and bid others to be so, and hide what God has given them in His largesse. We have prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment.",36,4,ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا,"Allah does not like those who do not spend what Allah made a duty on them from the wealth He gave them out of His provision, and who instruct others through their words and actions to do the same as them: hiding the wealth, knowledge and other things which Allah has given them out of His grace; not showing people the truth, but hiding it instead and showing falsehood. These are among the traits of disbelief, and Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for those who disbelieve."
"Those who spend of their wealth to show off and do not believe in God and the Last Day, take Satan as companion, and how evil a companion (have they)!",37,4,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَا بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَمَن يَكُنِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ لَهُۥ قَرِينًا فَسَآءَ قَرِينًا,"Allah has prepared this humiliating punishment for those who spend their wealth so that people notice them and praise them, and those who do not have faith in Allah and the Last Day. It is through following Satan that they have gone the wrong way. Whoever has Satan for a friend and companion has a terrible companion."
"Would something have befallen them if they had believed in God and the Last Day, and spent of what has been given them by God? God is fully aware of all they do.",38,4,وَمَاذَا عَلَيْهِمْ لَوْ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَأَنفَقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِمْ عَلِيمًا,"What harm would it have done these people if they had faith in Allah and the Last Day and had spent their wealth for Allah’s sake, being sincere to Him? Rather, they would have received everything that is good by doing so. Allah has full knowledge of them. Nothing about them is hidden from Him and everyone will be rewarded according to what they do."
"God does not wrong any one, not even the equal of an atom; and if men do good He multiplies it by two, and adds a great reward of His own.",39,4,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"Allah is Just and does not wrong His creatures in any way. He does not lessen the good they do by the weight of even a tiny particle or dust, and He does not add to their disobedience in any way. Even if only an atom’s worth of good is done, He multiplies the reward, from His grace, and through this increase He gives a great reward."
How shall it be when We call witnesses from each and every people and call you as witness over them?,40,4,فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍۭ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ شَهِيدًا,"What will it be like on the Day of Judgement, when Allah brings the prophet of each community to bear witness against their actions, and Allah brings the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a witness for all the communities and messengers?"
"On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Prophet, shall wish they were levelled with the dust, and shall not be able to conceal a thing from God.",41,4,يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَعَصَوُا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ ٱللَّهَ حَدِيثًا,"On that great day, those who disbelieved in Allah and went against His Messenger will wish they were dust and that the earth and they were level. They will not hide anything of what they did from Allah. Allah will seal their mouths so that they cannot speak and will give permission to their limbs to bear witness to what they did."
"O you who believe, do not perform your service of prayer when you are intoxicated until you are sure of what you are saying, nor when in a state of seminal pollution, until you have taken a bath, except when you are travelling. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have relieved yourself of nature's call, or cohabited with a woman, and cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and hands: God is benign and forgiving.",42,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَٰرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَعْلَمُوا۟ مَا تَقُولُونَ وَلَا جُنُبًا إِلَّا عَابِرِى سَبِيلٍ حَتَّىٰ تَغْتَسِلُوا۟ وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَىٰٓ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنكُم مِّنَ ٱلْغَآئِطِ أَوْ لَٰمَسْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُوا۟ مَآءً فَتَيَمَّمُوا۟ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَٱمْسَحُوا۟ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not pray when you are drunk, until you recover from your drunkenness, and can tell what you are saying. (This ruling was before alcohol was completely forbidden.) Do not pray when you are in a state of major ritual impurity, and do not enter the mosques when you are in that state, except in passing, until you have washed your body. If you have an illness and cannot use water because of it, or if you are travelling, or have answered the call of nature, or have had sexual relations with women, and you cannot find water, then find clean earth, and wipe your faces and hands with it. Allah pardons your shortcomings and is Forgiving to you."
"Have you not seen the people who were given a share of the Book, but who purchased only error, and wish that you also go astray?",43,4,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ نَصِيبًا مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يَشْتَرُونَ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن تَضِلُّوا۟ ٱلسَّبِيلَ,"O Messenger, do you not know about the Jews who were given a portion of knowledge in the Torah and traded guidance for error? They wish you would go astray from following the right way of life – which the Messenger came with – and that you would follow them in their deviation."
"But God knows your enemies well: and sufficient is God to protect you, and sufficient is God for all help.",44,4,وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِأَعْدَآئِكُمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ نَصِيرًا,"Allah knows your enemies better than you do, O believers, so He informs you of them and makes clear to you that they are against you. Allah is enough as a Protector, keeping you safe from them harming you; and Allah is enough as a Helper, stopping them from plotting against you and from hurting you."
"Some among the Jews distort the words out of context and say (in place of the right words): ""We have heard and do not obey;"" and, ""hear without hearing,"" and ""listen to us,"" twisting their tongues and reviling the faith. But if they had said: ""We have heard and obey,"" and, ""hear and regard us,"" it would have been better for them and more appropriate. But God has disgraced them for their lack of belief; and so only a few of them believe.",45,4,مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِۦ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَٰعِنَا لَيًّۢا بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْنًا فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ وَٱنظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَٰكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Among the Jews are an evil group who change the words Allah sent down, interpreting them in a way that they were not revealed. They say to the Messenger (peace be upon him), when he instructs them in something, that they hear and disobey, and say, “Listen to us, may you not hear!; and give the wrong impression when they say, ‘Rā’inā’: meaning ‘watch over us’ when they really mean ‘ru’ūnah’ or ‘silliness’, twisting what they say when they want to call the Prophet (peace be upon him) so that they say something insulting to the faith. If they had said ‘We hear and obey’, instead of ‘We hear and disobey’; ‘Listen’, instead of ‘‘Listen to us, may you not hear!""; and had truly said, ‘Watch over us’, then these would have been better for them than what they said, and more appropriate, being worthy and correct behaviour in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him). But Allah condemned them and removed them from His mercy due to their disbelief, because they do not have faith in any way that is beneficial."
"O people of the Book, believe in what We have revealed, which confirms what is already with you before We disfigure your visages and turn your faces about and curse you, as We did with those who had broken the Sabbath; and what God decrees comes to pass.",46,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِمَا نَزَّلْنَا مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا مَعَكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّطْمِسَ وُجُوهًا فَنَرُدَّهَا عَلَىٰٓ أَدْبَارِهَآ أَوْ نَلْعَنَهُمْ كَمَا لَعَنَّآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلسَّبْتِ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ مَفْعُولًا,"O you of the Jews and the Christians who were given the scripture, have faith in what I revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) which confirmed what you had in the Torah and the Gospel, before the faces are blotted out and are turned backwards; or they are removed from the mercy of Allah like those who broke the Sabbath by fishing when this had been prohibited to them, for which Allah transformed them into monkeys. Allah’s decree is certainly carried out."
"God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, though He may forgive aught else if He please. And he who ascribes compeers to God is guilty of the gravest sin.",47,4,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا,"Allah does not forgive that anything from His creation should be associated to Him. Besides this and disbelief, He pardons the disobedience of whomever He wills, out of His bounty. Or He punishes those He wills among them according to their disobedience, out of His perfect justice. Whoever worships others next to Allah has committed a terrible sin, which is not forgiven if someone dies still doing it."
"Have you not seen the people who call themselves pure? Yet God purifies whom He pleases, and none shall be wronged even the breadth of a thread.",48,4,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنفُسَهُم بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يُزَكِّى مَن يَشَآءُ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا,"Do you not know, O Messenger, the affair of those who are full of praise for themselves and of what they do? Allah alone praises whomever He wills, because He knows whatever is hidden in people’s hearts, and will not lessen the reward for their actions in any way, not even as much as the thread of a date stone."
"See how they fabricate lies about God, which is a clear sin.",49,4,ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِۦٓ إِثْمًا مُّبِينًا,"Look, O Messenger, how they create a lie against Allah in praising themselves. That is enough of a sin to demonstrate their misguidance."
"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, who believe in false deities and evil powers, and say of unbelievers: ""These are better guided than those who believe.""",50,4,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ نَصِيبًا مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْجِبْتِ وَٱلطَّٰغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ سَبِيلًا,"Do you not know, O Messenger, and wonder at the state of the Jews – who Allah gave a portion of knowledge – that believe in all sorts of false gods, and flatter the idolaters, saying that they are more rightly guided than the Companions of Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
They are the ones who were cursed by God; and those who are cursed by God will have none to protect them.,51,4,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يَلْعَنِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُۥ نَصِيرًا,"Those who have these corrupt beliefs are removed from Allah’s mercy, and whoever is removed from Allah’s mercy you will find no helper to protect them."
"Have they a share in the kingdom? (If they had,) they would never have given an iota to the people.",52,4,أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُلْكِ فَإِذًا لَّا يُؤْتُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ نَقِيرًا,"They do not have any share in the dominion, and if they did, they would not give people anything from it, not even as much as the speck on the surface of a date stone."
"Are they so envious of others for what God has given them of His bounty? So We had given the Book and the Law to Abraham's family, and given them great dominion.",53,4,أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ عَلَىٰ مَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ فَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ ءَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُم مُّلْكًا عَظِيمًا,"Rather, they envy Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his Companions because of the prophethood, faith and establishment in the land which Allah has given to them. Why do they envy them when Allah gave the descendants of Abraham the revealed scripture and other revelation besides the scripture, and Allah gave them far-reaching power over people."
"Then some of them believed in it, and some turned away from it; yet sufficient is Hell, the flaming Fire!",54,4,فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن صَدَّ عَنْهُ وَكَفَىٰ بِجَهَنَّمَ سَعِيرًا,"Some of the People of the Scripture have faith in what Allah revealed to Abraham (peace be upon him), and to the prophets among his descendants; and there are those who denied this, and turned people away from having faith in it, and who do the same with what was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The fire of Hell is sufficient as a punishment for those of them who disbelieve."
"And those who disbelieve Our revelations shall be cast into Hell; and when their skin is burnt up and singed, We shall give them a new coat that they may go on tasting the agony of punishment, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.",55,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُم بَدَّلْنَٰهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,"Those who disbelieve in the signs and verses of Allah will be entered into a fire that surrounds them on the Day of Judgement. Whenever their skins have been burned, they will be replaced with fresh skins, so that they continue to feel the punishment. Allah is Mighty, and nothing detracts from His might. And He is Wise in His administration and decree."
"But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water, where they will abide for ever, with fairest of companions and coolest of shades.",56,4,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا,"Those who have faith in Allah and follow His messengers, doing good actions, will be entered on the Day of Judgement into gardens with rivers flowing beneath their palaces, where they will live eternally. In these gardens there will be mates for them, purified from any impurity, and they will be entered into expansive refreshing shade."
"God enjoins that you render to the owners what is held in trust with you, and that when you judge among the people do so equitably. Noble are the counsels of God, and God hears all and sees everything.",57,4,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤَدُّوا۟ ٱلْأَمَٰنَٰتِ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهَا وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُم بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ أَن تَحْكُمُوا۟ بِٱلْعَدْلِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُم بِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًۢا بَصِيرًا,"Allah instructs you, O believers, to return things in your care to the people who own them. He instructs you, if you judge between people in any matter, to judge between them with justice according to His sacred laws. Allah’s laws in every situation for you are, of course, excellent. Allah hears all that you say and sees all that you do."
"O you who believe, obey God and the Prophet and those in authority among you; and if you are at variance over something, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day. This is good for you and the best of settlement.",58,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ فَإِن تَنَٰزَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا,"O you who have faith, follow Allah and His Messenger: doing what they instruct and staying away from what they prohibit, and follow those in authority, as long as they do not instruct you to do wrong. If you disagree about something, then refer it to Allah’s revelation and the traditions of His Prophet (peace be upon him), if you have faith in Allah and the Last Day. Referring to the revelation and the traditions is better than continuing in your disagreements and in giving mere opinions, and will bring about the best result for you."
"Have you never seen those who aver they believe in what has been revealed to you and had been to others before you, yet desire to turn for judgement to evil powers, even though they have been commanded to disbelieve in them? Satan only wishes to lead them astray, far away.",59,4,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلطَّٰغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوٓا۟ أَن يَكْفُرُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَن يُضِلَّهُمْ ضَلَٰلًۢا بَعِيدًا,"Have you not seen, O Messenger, the contradiction of the hypocrites among the Jews, who claim falsely that they have faith in what was revealed to you and in what was revealed to the messengers before you, but in resolving their disagreements want to refer back to what Allah has not legislated, and what people have invented, when they were instructed to reject such things. Satan wants to lead them far away from the truth, and they will not be guided through this."
"When they are told: ""Come to that which God has revealed, and to the Prophet,"" you should see the hypocrites, how they hesitate and turn their faces away.",60,4,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُودًا,"If these hypocrites are told to come to the law that Allah has revealed in His Scripture, and to the Messenger to judge between them in their disagreements, you will see them, O Messenger, turning away from you completely to others."
"How shall it be when they suffer misfortunes for their own misdeeds? Then they will come to you swearing by God and saying: ""We wish for nothing but good and amity.""",61,4,فَكَيْفَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌۢ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ جَآءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلَّآ إِحْسَٰنًا وَتَوْفِيقًا,"How will their situation be when misfortunes come upon them because of the sins they have committed, and then they come to you, O Messenger, apologising and swearing by Allah that when they turned to other things to try and settle their disagreements they were only trying to do good and bring about reconciliation between the people who were disagreeing. What they say is false, and doing good involves following the rulings of Allah’s sacred law."
"The secrets of the hearts of these people are well known to God. So leave them alone, and counsel them and speak to them eloquent words that would touch their very souls.",62,4,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًۢا بَلِيغًا,"Allah knows what hypocrisy and ulterior motives these people hide in their hearts, so turn away from them, O Messenger, and make clear to them the laws of Allah: encouraging them to be loyal to Allah, making clear to them how wrong it is to turn away from Him, and advise them in a way that will move them."
"We have sent no apostle but that he should be obeyed by the will of God. If they had come to you after wronging themselves and asked forgiveness of God, and you had also asked forgiveness for them, they would surely have found God forgiving and merciful.",63,4,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ جَآءُوكَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا,"Allah did not send any messenger except to be followed in what they instructed by Allah’s will and decree. If, when they wronged themselves by committing sins, they had come to you, O Messenger, confessing what they had done and regretting it, repenting from what they did, and if they had asked for forgiveness from Allah, and you had asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Forgiving and Compassionate with them."
"Indeed, by your Lord, they will not believe till they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about your decisions and accept them with full acquiescence.",64,4,فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا۟ تَسْلِيمًا,"What these hypocrites claim is not true. Allah swears by Himself that they will not have real faith until they refer for judgements to the Messenger, during his lifetime, and to the sacred law after his death, in every disagreement between them, and are happy with the Messenger’s ruling, without feeling hatred about it, or doubting it, and accepting it completely and faithfully, outwardly and inwardly."
"If We had commanded them to lay down their lives and to go forth from their homes, only a few would have obeyed; though had they followed what they had been commanded it would surely have been good for them and the strengthening of their faith.",65,4,وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ٱقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ أَوِ ٱخْرُجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِكُم مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُوا۟ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِۦ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتًا,And I would have enabled them to come on to the straight path that leads to Me and My Paradise.
"And We would have bestowed on them a great reward of Our own,",66,4,وَإِذًا لَّءَاتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّآ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,And I would have enabled them to come on to the straight path that leads to Me and My Paradise.
And led them to the path that is straight.,67,4,وَلَهَدَيْنَٰهُمْ صِرَٰطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا,And I would have enabled them to come on to the straight path that leads to Me and My Paradise.
"Those who obey God and the Prophet are with those who are blessed by God, the prophets, the sincere and the trustful, the martyrs and the upright; and how excellent a company are they!",68,4,وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ وَٱلصِّدِّيقِينَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ رَفِيقًا,"Those who follow Allah and the Messenger will be with those whom Allah has blessed with entry into Paradise from amongst the prophets, the truthful ones whose acceptance of what the prophets brought was complete and who practised it, the martyrs who were killed in Allah’s path, and the righteous whose outward and inward states and actions are virtuous. What excellent companions these are in Paradise!"
"This is a favour from God; and sufficient is God, the all-knowing.",69,4,ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَضْلُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ عَلِيمًا,This reward is Allah’s grace to His servants. Allah knows the states of the people and will reward them all accordingly.
"O believers, take precautions, and advance in detachments, or go all together in a body.",70,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ خُذُوا۟ حِذْرَكُمْ فَٱنفِرُوا۟ ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ ٱنفِرُوا۟ جَمِيعًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, be on your guard against your enemies by adopting the means that will help you to fight them. Go out to fight them one group after the other or go out altogether and do what is in your interests and what will bring loss to your enemies."
"Someone among you will surely lag behind, and if calamity should befall you, will say: ""God was gracious to me that I was not among them.""",71,4,وَإِنَّ مِنكُمْ لَمَن لَّيُبَطِّئَنَّ فَإِنْ أَصَٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالَ قَدْ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىَّ إِذْ لَمْ أَكُن مَّعَهُمْ شَهِيدًا,"There are among you, O Muslims, some people who hesitate to go out to fight your enemies, because of their cowardice, and who also try to keep others behind. They are the hypocrites and who are weak in faith. If you are killed or defeated, then one of them, happy that he is safe, says, ‘Allah has favoured me in that I was not present at the fight with them, otherwise I would have also been harmed like them’."
"But if success comes to you from God he will say, as though no love existed between you and him: ""I wish I were with them, for I would have certainly met with great success.""",72,4,وَلَئِنْ أَصَٰبَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَن لَّمْ تَكُنۢ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُۥ مَوَدَّةٌ يَٰلَيْتَنِى كُنتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا,"If Allah’s grace of support and gains of war come to you, O Muslims, this person – who lags behind from striving in Allah’s path – says, as if there was friendship or affinity between you and him, ‘If only I was with them in that fight, I would have also gained great success’. Worldly benefits are the only goal of such a person."
"Those who barter the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of God. And We shall bestow on him who fights in the way of God, whether he is killed or is victorious, a glorious reward.",73,4,فَلْيُقَٰتِلْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْرُونَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَمَن يُقَٰتِلْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَوْ يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"Let the true believers – who sell the life of this world in exchange for the Afterlife, desiring the Afterlife more than the goods of this world – fight in the path of Allah so that Allah’s Word is victorious. Anyone who fights in the path of Allah, so that His Word triumphs, and is killed as a martyr or defeats the enemy and is successful, Allah will give them a great reward: Paradise and the pleasure of Allah."
"What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children, who pray: ""Get us out of this city, O Lord, whose people are oppressors; so send us a friend by Your will, and send us a helper.""",74,4,وَمَا لَكُمْ لَا تُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَٱجْعَل لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيًّا وَٱجْعَل لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ نَصِيرًا,"What is preventing you, O believers, from striving in the path of Allah in order to raise His Word and to rescue the oppressed men, women and children who call to Allah, saying, ‘Our Lord, let us leave Makkah, because its people are oppressive – due to their associating partners with Allah and their aggression towards His servants. Give us someone from You who will take control of our affairs, take care of us and protect us from harm’."
"Those who believe fight in the way of God; and those who do not, only fight for the powers of evil; so you should fight the allies of Satan. Surely the stratagem of Satan is ineffective.",75,4,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱلطَّٰغُوتِ فَقَٰتِلُوٓا۟ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّ كَيْدَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ كَانَ ضَعِيفًا,"The true believers fight in the path of Allah in order to raise His Word. The disbelievers, on the other hand, fight in the path and way of Satan. So fight the supporters of Satan. If you fight them, you will defeat them, because Satan’s strategy is weak and it cannot harm those who place their reliance in Allah."
"Have you not seen the people who were told: ""Hold back your hands (from attacking), observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat?"" But when they were commanded to fight, behold, a section among them were filled with fear of men as though it were the fear of God and even more, and said: ""O Lord, why did you make war compulsory for us? Why did you not allow us to live a little more?"" Say to them: ""How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread.""",76,4,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّوٓا۟ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ ٱلنَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً وَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْقِتَالَ لَوْلَآ أَخَّرْتَنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَٰعُ ٱلدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَٱلْءَاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا,"Have you, O Messenger, thought about the condition of some of your Companions who asked that striving in Allah’s path be ordained for them, but they were told, ‘Restrain your hands from fighting, establish the prayer and give charity ’. This was before striving in Allah’s path was ordained. When they migrated to Medina and Islam became strong, and fighting was ordained, they found it difficult, and some of them began fearing people as they should fear Allah or even more than that. They said, ‘Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting for us? Why did You not delay it for a while so we could enjoy the worldly life’. Say to them, O Messenger: The enjoyment of the world, no matter how much, is little and perishable. Yet the Hereafter is better for the one who is mindful of Allah because its delights are everlasting. Your good actions will not be reduced in the least, not even to the extent of the thread that is on the date stone."
"Death will overtake you wheresoever you be, even in the mightiest of towers. Yet if some good comes their way they say: ""It is from God;"" and if it is evil that befalls them, they say: ""It is indeed from you."" Say to them: ""Every thing is from God."" O, what has come upon the people that even this they fail to understand!",77,4,أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُوا۟ يُدْرِككُّمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُوا۟ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُوا۟ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنْ عِندِكَ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَالِ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ لَا يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثًا,"At any time and place, death will surely come to you when reach your prescribed life term, even if you are in guarded palaces far from battle. And when these hypocrites receive something pleasing, such as a child or wealth, they say, ‘This is from Allah’. Yet when they face some difficulty with respect to their children or wealth, they attribute a bad sign and misfortune to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and they say, ‘This evil is because of you’. Say, O Messenger, in response to these people: Everything, good or bad, occurs by Allah’s decree and decision. What is the matter with these people, who say such things, that they can hardly understand anything you tell them?"
What comes to you of good is verily from God; and what comes to you of ill is from your own self (your actions). We have sent you as apostle to all mankind; and God is sufficient as witness.,78,4,مَّآ أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ وَأَرْسَلْنَٰكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًا,"O humankind, any good that pleases you – such as wealth or children – is from Allah. He has sent it to you through His grace. Whatever bad occurs to you in respect of your wealth or children is from your own self because of the sins you commit. I have sent you, O Prophet, as a messenger to all people to communicate to them the message of your Lord. Allah is enough of a witness to the truth of what you communicate from Him, because of the evidences and proof He has given you."
He who obeys the Apostle obeys God; and if some turn away (remember) We have not sent you as warden over them.,79,4,مَّن يُطِعِ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ ٱللَّهَ وَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا,"Whoever follows the Messenger by fulfilling his instructions and avoiding his prohibitions has actually followed Allah. If anyone turns away from following you, O Messenger, do not feel sad about it, because I have not sent you as a guard to watch over what they do. I am the One Who will watch them and hold them to account for their actions."
"They say: ""We obey;"" but when they leave your company, a section of them discuss at night other things than you had said; but God takes note of what they discuss. So turn aside from them and trust in God; and God is sufficient as protector.",80,4,وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ فَإِذَا بَرَزُوا۟ مِنْ عِندِكَ بَيَّتَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى تَقُولُ وَٱللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا,"The hypocrites say to you, ‘We follow your instruction and we will act with obedience’. Yet when they leave you, a group of them secretly plan the opposite of what they said to you. Allah knows their planning and He will recompense them accordingly. So turn away from them and pay no attention, as they will not harm you at all. Surrender your matter to Allah and rely on Him alone for He is sufficient for you as a Guardian to watch over your affairs and take care of you."
Do they not ponder over the Qur'an? Had it been the word of any other but God they would surely have found a good deal of variation in it.,81,4,أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا۟ فِيهِ ٱخْتِلَٰفًا كَثِيرًا,"Why do these people not reflect over the Qur'ān and study it until they realise that it contains no differences or inconsistency, so that they can accept the truth of what you brought? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have found inconsistencies in its rulings and differences in its meanings."
"And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around. Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it, And but for the favour of God and His mercy you would certainly have followed Satan, except a few.",82,4,وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰٓ أُو۟لِى ٱلْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنۢبِطُونَهُۥ مِنْهُمْ وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ لَٱتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Whenever there comes a public matter comprising safety and happiness for the Muslims, or matters of fear and sadness, the hypocrites rush to spread its news amongst the people. If they had waited and referred the matter to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and to those in charge of their affairs, those who are able to reason and draw conclusions would know what is to be done with respect to spreading such news or concealing it. If it were not for Allah’s grace and mercy on you, almost all of you would have followed the whisperings of Satan."
"So fight on in the way of God (irrespective of the others). You cannot compel any one except your own self; but urge the believers to fight. It may well be that God will keep back the might of the infidels, for God's might is greater, and severe His punishment.",83,4,فَقَٰتِلْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُكَلَّفُ إِلَّا نَفْسَكَ وَحَرِّضِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَكُفَّ بَأْسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ أَشَدُّ بَأْسًا وَأَشَدُّ تَنكِيلًا,"Fight, O Prophet, in Allah’s path to raise His Word. You will not be questioned about or held accountable for others. You are only responsible to fight yourself and to urge the believers to do so. Perhaps Allah will push back the force of the disbelievers by your fighting. Allah is stronger in force and more severe in punishment."
He who intercedes in a good cause will surely have a share in the recompense; and he who abets an evil act will share the burden thereof; for God (equates and) is watchful of all things.,84,4,مَّن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةً يَكُن لَّهُۥ نَصِيبٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً سَيِّئَةً يَكُن لَّهُۥ كِفْلٌ مِّنْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّقِيتًا,"Whoever intercedes or directs another person to some good them in a manner containing no sin or oppression, will receive a share of the reward of the good outcome; and whoever makes a bad intercession, which contains sin or oppression, will receive a share of the sin. Allah watches everything that a person does and will reward him accordingly. So if you become a means of goodness, you will receive a share in that good; and if you become a means of doing evil, you will be guilty for a part of it."
"When you are greeted with a greeting, then greet with one fairer, or repeat the same greeting. For God takes account of all things.",85,4,وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّوا۟ بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَآ أَوْ رُدُّوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَسِيبًا,"When anyone offers a greeting of peace to you, then respond to him with something better than what he offered or return a similar greeting to him. To respond with something better is more virtuous. Allah keeps watch over what you do and He will reward each person according to his actions."
God: There is no god but He. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come; and whose word is truer than God's?,86,4,ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حَدِيثًا,"Allah is the One Who alone deserves to be worshipped. He will gather every single one of you on the Day of Judgement, about which there is no doubt, in order to reward you for your actions. There is no one more truthful in speech than Allah."
How is it that you are divided in two factions about the hypocrites? God has routed them for what they were doing. Do you wish to guide him to the path whom God has allowed to go astray? As for him whom God allows to go astray you will not find a way.,87,4,فَمَا لَكُمْ فِى ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ أَرْكَسَهُم بِمَا كَسَبُوٓا۟ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُوا۟ مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُۥ سَبِيلًا,"Why is it, O believers, that you have become two groups differing over how to deal with the hypocrites? One group wants to fight against them because of their disbelief and another group wants to leave them because of their faith. You should not disagree over them for Allah has returned them to disbelief and misguidance because of their actions. Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has not shown the truth? If Allah misguides anyone, you will never find a way to guide such a person."
"They wish you to become disbelievers as they are, so that you should become like them. Therefore hold them not as friends until they go out of their homes in the way of God. If they do not, seize them wherever they are and do away with them. Do not make them your friends or allies,",88,4,وَدُّوا۟ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُوا۟ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَآءً فَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"The hypocrites wish that you disbelieve in what was revealed to you as they have done, so that you can be equal to them in disbelief. Due to their animosity, do not take them as friends until they migrate in Allah’s path; hence indicating their faith. If they turn away and continue with their bad actions, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take from them any friend to help you with your affairs nor anyone to assist you against your enemies."
"Except those who take refuge with a people allied to you, or those who, weary of fighting you or their people, come over to you. If God had so willed He would surely have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they keep aloof and do not fight, and offer peace, God has left you no reason to fight them.",89,4,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍۭ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُم مِّيثَٰقٌ أَوْ جَآءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَن يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ أَوْ يُقَٰتِلُوا۟ قَوْمَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَٰتَلُوكُمْ فَإِنِ ٱعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْا۟ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ فَمَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلًا,"But you cannot act like this with those of them who join a people with whom you have a peace treaty or those who come to you reluctant to fight against you or their own people. If Allah willed to give them power over you, He would have done so and they would have fought you. Therefore, accept the safety that Allah has given you and do not interfere with them by killing or taking any one of them as captives. If they stay away without fighting you and they come to you to make peace, then Allah has not given you any authority to fight them or take any of them as prisoners."
"You will also find persons who, while wishing to live in peace with you as well as with their own people, turn to civil war the moment they are called to it. If they do not keep away from you, nor offer you peace nor restrain their hands, seize them and kill them wherever they are. We have given you a clear sanction against them.",90,4,سَتَجِدُونَ ءَاخَرِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَأْمَنُوكُمْ وَيَأْمَنُوا۟ قَوْمَهُمْ كُلَّ مَا رُدُّوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلْفِتْنَةِ أُرْكِسُوا۟ فِيهَا فَإِن لَّمْ يَعْتَزِلُوكُمْ وَيُلْقُوٓا۟ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَيَكُفُّوٓا۟ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكُمْ جَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَٰنًا مُّبِينًا,"You, O believers, will find another group of hypocrites who pretend to have faith when they are before you in order to protect themselves; but they display their disbelief when they are with their people, so that they are safe from them as well. Whenever they are called to disbelief in Allah and to ascribe partners to Him, they plunge into it. These are the ones, if they do not keep away from fighting you or if they do not make peace with you and restrain themselves, to seize and kill wherever you find them. These are the ones whom Allah has given you a clear authority for seizing and killing them because they are treacherous."
"It is not for a believer to take a believer's life except by mistake; and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a slave who is a believer, and pay blood-money to the victim's family unless they forego it as an act of charity. If he belonged to a community hostile to you but was himself a believer, then a slave who is a believer should be freed. In case he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then give blood-money to his family and free a believing slave. But he who has no means (to do so) should fast for a period of two months continuously to have his sins forgiven by God, and God is all-knowing and all-wise.",91,4,وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ أَن يَقْتُلَ مُؤْمِنًا إِلَّا خَطَـًٔا وَمَن قَتَلَ مُؤْمِنًا خَطَـًٔا فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن يَصَّدَّقُوا۟ فَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ عَدُوٍّ لَّكُمْ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍۭ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُم مِّيثَٰقٌ فَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِۦ وَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ تَوْبَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"It is unlawful for a believer to kill another believer, unless it occurs by mistake. If anyone kills a believer by mistake, he must free a believing slave as a compensation for his action. The relatives of the killer, who inherit from him, will be responsible for the blood money to be handed over to the successors of the victim, unless the successors give up the right If the victim belonged to a people at war with you, but he was a believer, then the killer must free a believing slave and no blood money will be owed. If the victim was not a believer but belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, such as disbelievers living in an Islamic state, the relatives of the killer, who inherit from him, will be responsible for blood money to be handed over to the successors of the victim and the killer must free a believing slave as compensation for his action. If he cannot find anyone to free or he cannot afford the price, then he must fast continuously for two consecutive months so that Allah accepts his repentance for what he has done. Allah knows the actions of His servants and their intentions; and He is Wise in His legislation and planning."
"Any one who kills a believer intentionally will be cast into Hell to abide there for ever, and suffer God's anger and damnation. For him a greater punishment awaits.",92,4,وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِنًا مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَآؤُهُۥ جَهَنَّمُ خَٰلِدًا فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَعَنَهُۥ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُۥ عَذَابًا عَظِيمًا,"If anyone kills a believer, deliberately intending to do so, his recompense will be Hell to live there eternally. Allah will be angry with him, distance him from His mercy, and will prepare for him a great punishment for committing such a serious crime. The belief of the Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā’ah is that if the killer is a believing Muslim, he will not literally remain in Hell eternally; but he will be punished in it for a long period and will then be removed from there through Allah’s grace."
"O believers, when you go out on a journey in the way of God, be discreet and do not say to anyone who greets you in peace: ""You are not a believer."" You desire the gain of earthly life, but there are prizes in plenty with God. You were also like him (an unbeliever) in the past, but God has been gracious to you. So be careful and discreet, for God is aware of what you do.",93,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُوا۟ وَلَا تَقُولُوا۟ لِمَنْ أَلْقَىٰٓ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَٰمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ كَذَٰلِكَ كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, when you go out to fight in Allah’s path, be sure about the case of those you are fighting. Do not say to the person who displays something indicating that he is a believer, ‘You are not a believer! You only displayed Islam out of fear for your life and wealth’; so that you then kill him in order to get the trivial goods of the world, such as the booty you acquire from this person after killing him. Yet Allah has much provision that is better and greater than this. In the past you were also like this person: hiding your faith from the people. Then Allah favoured you with Islam and protected your lives. So be careful, as Allah knows well what you do. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will reward you for your actions."
"The faithful who sit idle, other than those who are disabled, are not equal to those who fight in the way of God with their wealth and lives. God has exalted those in rank who fight for the faith with their wealth and souls over those who sit idle. Though God's promise of good is for all, He has granted His favour of the highest reward to those who struggle in preference to those who sit at home.",94,4,لَّا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْقَٰعِدُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُو۟لِى ٱلضَّرَرِ وَٱلْمُجَٰهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُلًّا وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَفَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"Those believers who remain behind from striving in Allah’s path – besides those who have an excuse, such as sickness – are not equal to those who strive in Allah’s path, spending their wealth and giving their time. Allah has given those who strive in His path a rank above those who remain behind. Those who strive, as well as those who remain behind with a valid excuse, shall receive the reward they deserve. Allah has preferred those who strive over those who sit back by giving them a greater reward from Him."
"For them are higher ranks with God, and forgiveness and grace; and God is forgiving and kind.",95,4,دَرَجَٰتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"This reward will be ranks of loftiness and positions in the Paradise, one above the other, together with forgiveness of their sins and mercy. Allah is always Forgiving and Merciful towards His servants."
"As for those whose souls are taken by the angels (at death) while in a state of unbelief, they will be asked by the angels: ""What (state) were you in?"" They will answer: ""We were oppressed in the land."" And the angels will say: ""Was not God's earth large enough for you to migrate?"" Their abode will be Hell, and what an evil destination!",96,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَفَّىٰهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ ظَالِمِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا۟ فِيمَ كُنتُمْ قَالُوا۟ كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ قَالُوٓا۟ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَٰسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا۟ فِيهَا فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيرًا,"When the angels take the souls of those who wrong themselves by not migrating from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, the angels say to them at that time, while reprimanding them, ‘What was the status of your religion that you did not migrate?’ They reply, presenting the excuse, ‘We were weak and powerless, and we could not defend ourselves’. The angels again criticise them, ‘Were not the lands of Allah spacious enough for you to leave the place you were in order to save your religion and yourselves from humiliation and domination?’ The end of those who did not migrate will be the fire of Hell, where they will settle. What an evil place of return it will be for them! This is because their failure to migrate, despite being able to do so, indicates that they were not true in their Islam."
"But those who are helpless, men, women and children, who can neither contrive a plan nor do they know the way,",97,4,إِلَّا ٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا,Perhaps Allah will pardon such people through His mercy and grace. Allah always pardons His servants and forgives those who repent to Him.
May well hope for the mercy of God; and God is full of mercy and grace.,98,4,فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا,Perhaps Allah will pardon such people through His mercy and grace. Allah always pardons His servants and forgives those who repent to Him.
"Whosoever leaves his country in duty to God will find many places of refuge, and abundance on the earth. And he who leaves his home and becomes an emigre in the way of God and His Messenger, and death overtake him, is sure to receive his reward from God; for God is forgiving and kind.",99,4,وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُرَٰغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِنۢ بَيْتِهِۦ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُۥ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"Whoever migrates from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam in order to gain Allah’s pleasure will find a much better place in the land they migrated to, in comparison to the land they left. In this new land, they will receive honour and much provision. Whoever leaves their home as migrants to Allah and His Messenger and then pass away before reaching the land they are migrating to, their reward shall definitely be with Allah, even though they did not reach the land of migration. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to those of His servants who repent to Him."
"When you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear the unbelievers may harass you, for indeed your open enemies are the infidels.",100,4,وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ إِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَن يَفْتِنَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ كَانُوا۟ لَكُمْ عَدُوًّا مُّبِينًا,"When you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer from four units to two units of prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers will harm you. The disbelievers are open enemies to you, O believers."
"When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms. After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares. It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions. God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment",101,4,وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُم مَّعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوٓا۟ أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ فَإِذَا سَجَدُوا۟ فَلْيَكُونُوا۟ مِن وَرَآئِكُمْ وَلْتَأْتِ طَآئِفَةٌ أُخْرَىٰ لَمْ يُصَلُّوا۟ فَلْيُصَلُّوا۟ مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوا۟ حِذْرَهُمْ وَأَسْلِحَتَهُمْ وَدَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْ تَغْفُلُونَ عَنْ أَسْلِحَتِكُمْ وَأَمْتِعَتِكُمْ فَيَمِيلُونَ عَلَيْكُم مَّيْلَةً وَٰحِدَةً وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن كَانَ بِكُمْ أَذًى مِّن مَّطَرٍ أَوْ كُنتُم مَّرْضَىٰٓ أَن تَضَعُوٓا۟ أَسْلِحَتَكُمْ وَخُذُوا۟ حِذْرَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا,"When you, O Messenger, are with them in the army, fighting the enemy, and you wish to lead them in prayer, then divide the army into two groups: one group should stand and pray with you, keeping their weapons with them during the prayer, whilst the other group guards you. When the first group has completed one unit of prayer with the Imam, it must complete the rest of the prayer on its own, and then go to the back to face the direction of the enemy. Then the other group, which was on guard and which has not prayed as yet, should come and pray one unit of prayer with the leader. When the leader completes the prayer with the salām, they should complete the balance of their prayer on their own. They should be careful of the enemy and keep their weapons with them. The disbelievers wish that you become unmindful of your weapons and your goods when you are in prayer, so that they can attack you in a single assault. There is no sin on you to put down your weapons when you are in difficulty because of rain, illness, and the like. but be careful of the enemy as much as possible. Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a punishment that will humiliate them."
"If you are late in performing your service of prayer honour God by remembering Him, standing or sitting or lying on your sides. And when you have security perform your act of prayer befittingly; and praying at fixed hours is prescribed for the faithful.",102,4,فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمُ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ قِيَٰمًا وَقُعُودًا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِكُمْ فَإِذَا ٱطْمَأْنَنتُمْ فَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَٰبًا مَّوْقُوتًا,"When you, O believers, have finished the prayer, then remember Allah by glorifying Him by saying ‘Subḥān Allāh’, praising Him by saying ‘Alḥamdulillāh’ and declaring His Oneness by saying ‘Lā ilāha illallāh’. This is to be done however possible, whether you are standing, sitting or lying on your sides. When the fear is gone and you are safe, then establish the prayer by fulfilling all its articles, obligations and recommendations, as you have been instructed. Prayer is an obligation on the believers that is linked to particular times and may not be delayed without a valid reason when one is a resident. However, when you are travelling you are allowed to join and shorten prayers."
"And do not be chary of pursuing them. If you suffer, they shall also suffer like you. But while you have hope (of success) from God, they have none. Surely God is all-knowing and all-wise.",103,4,وَلَا تَهِنُوا۟ فِى ٱبْتِغَآءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ إِن تَكُونُوا۟ تَأْلَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ يَأْلَمُونَ كَمَا تَأْلَمُونَ وَتَرْجُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَرْجُونَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"Do not become weak and lazy, O believers, in pursuing your disbelieving enemy. If you are suffering pain because of the killing and injury that afflicts you, then they too are suffering the same pain as well. So do not let their patience be greater than yours, because you have hope of reward, help and support from Allah, which they cannot hope for. Allah knows the conditions of His servants and is Wise in His planning and legislation."
"We have sent down to you the Book containing the truth, in whose light you should judge among the people as God has shown you, and do not be a contender for deceivers.",104,4,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِمَآ أَرَىٰكَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَا تَكُن لِّلْخَآئِنِينَ خَصِيمًا,"I have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur'ān, which contains the truth, so that you can clarify matters and judge between the people in accordance with what Allah has taught and inspired you with, and not according to your whims and fancy. Do not be one to defend those who betray their own selves and their promises against those who demand their rights from them."
"And seek God's forgiveness, for God is surely forgiving and kind.",105,4,وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,Seek forgiveness and pardon from Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards those of His servants who repent to Him.
"Do not argue for those who harbour deceit in their hearts, for God does not love the treacherous and the iniquitous.",106,4,وَلَا تُجَٰدِلْ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ خَوَّانًا أَثِيمًا,"Do not argue on behalf of any person who commits a sin denying it, until you come to know more about the matter. Allah does not love these deceitful liars."
"They try to hide from (men), but they cannot hide from God who is with them at night when they discuss such matters as He does not approve; but what they do is well within the compass of God.",107,4,يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا,"When committing sin, they hide from people out of fear and shame; but they cannot hide from Allah. He is with them and knows what they do. Nothing is hidden from Him when they secretly plan to say things that He is not pleased with, such as defending a sinner or falsely accusing an innocent person. Allah surrounds them and knows what they do secretly and openly. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will repay them for their actions."
"Well, you are those who pleaded for them in the life of this world; but who will plead for them on the Day of Resurrection or be their security?",108,4,هَٰٓأَنتُمْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ جَٰدَلْتُمْ عَنْهُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَمَن يُجَٰدِلُ ٱللَّهَ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَم مَّن يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلًا,"You – O those concerned with the matter of these people who commit sin – argued on behalf of them in the world in order to establish their innocence and protect them from the punishment; but who will argue with Allah for them on the Day of Judgement when He knows their real condition? Who will be their representative in the matter on that day? Without any doubt, no one will be able to do that."
"He who does evil or acts against his own interests (by disbelieving), then prays for God's forgiveness, will find God compassionate and merciful.",109,4,وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوٓءًا أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُۥ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ يَجِدِ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"If anyone does an evil action or wrongs themselves by committing sins, and then they ask for forgiveness from Allah, regretfully admitting their sin and leaving it, they will find that Allah is always ready to forgive their sins and show them mercy."
He who earns the wages of sin does so for himself; and God is aware of everything and is wise.,110,4,وَمَن يَكْسِبْ إِثْمًا فَإِنَّمَا يَكْسِبُهُۥ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِۦ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,Those who commit a minor or major sin will have to face the punishment themselves. No one else will be held responsible. Allah knows the actions of His servants and is Wise in His planning and legislation.
"He who commits a mistake or iniquity and ascribes it to one who is innocent, is guilty of calumny and brazen sin.",111,4,وَمَن يَكْسِبْ خَطِيٓـَٔةً أَوْ إِثْمًا ثُمَّ يَرْمِ بِهِۦ بَرِيٓـًٔا فَقَدِ ٱحْتَمَلَ بُهْتَٰنًا وَإِثْمًا مُّبِينًا,"If a person does a wrong action unintentionally or a sin intentionally and then accuses an innocent person of the same, they have taken on themselves a serious lie and a clear sin by acting in that manner."
"But for the mercy of God and His grace you would certainly have been misled by a section of them; yet they could not mislead you but themselves alone, and could do you no harm, for God has revealed to you the Book and the Law, and taught you what you did not know. Great have been the blessings of God on you.",112,4,وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ لَهَمَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُضِلُّوكَ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَضُرُّونَكَ مِن شَىْءٍ وَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَكَ مَا لَمْ تَكُن تَعْلَمُ وَكَانَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيمًا,"If it were not for Allah’s grace in protecting you, O Messenger, a group of these people who deceive themselves would have tried to mislead you from the truth and you would have passed an unfair judgement. In reality, they only mislead their own selves, because they will have to face the consequences of their crime of misleading others. Allah has revealed the Qur'ān and Sunna to you and He has taught you guidance and light which you did not know before. Allah’s grace on you, by giving you prophethood and protecting you, is great."
"Their confidential counsels are seldom for the good, save of those who talk of charity or goodness or peace among men. Whosoever does so for the pleasure of God, We shall give him an ample reward.",113,4,لَّا خَيْرَ فِى كَثِيرٍ مِّن نَّجْوَىٰهُمْ إِلَّا مَنْ أَمَرَ بِصَدَقَةٍ أَوْ مَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ إِصْلَٰحٍۭ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"There is no good or benefit in much of the secret talk that people engage in, unless their speech includes an encouragement towards charity, good actions brought by the sacred law or those good actions known and approved off by people, or calling towards reconciliation between arguing parties. Whoever does such good, whilst seeking Allah’s pleasure, He shall give them a great reward."
"And he who opposes the Prophet even after the way has become clear to him, and follows a path other than the way of believers, We shall lead him to what he has chosen for himself, and shall take him to Hell: How evil a journey's end.",114,4,وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيرًا,"Whoever opposes and disobeys what the Messenger has brought after the truth has become clear to them, and follows a path other than that of the believers, I will leave them with what they have chosen; and I will not bring them to the truth, since they have deliberately turned away. I will then enter them into the fire of Hell to suffer in its heat. What an evil place to return to!"
"God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, and absolves all else whatsoever He will. And he who associates compeers with God has indeed wandered far astray.",115,4,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلًۢا بَعِيدًا,"Allah does not forgive the crime of associating partners with Him, for anyone who does so and dies in that state will live eternally in the fire of Hell. He may forgive all other sins besides associating partners with Him for whomever He wills if such people die committing those sins without repentance, out of His mercy and grace. Whoever associates anything as a partner with Allah has gone far away from the truth, as he has made the creation equal with the Creator."
In His place they invoke only females (the pagan deities); and instead of Him they invoke Satan the obstinate rebel,116,4,إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ إِنَٰثًا وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلَّا شَيْطَٰنًا مَّرِيدًا,"Instead of Allah, the idolators in Makkah worship female idols which were named with feminine names, such as al-Lāt and al-‘Uzzā, which can neither benefit nor harm anyone. In reality, they only worship Satan, who rebelled and sinned against his Lord, as he is the one who instructed them to worship the idols."
"Who was condemned by God and who said: ""I shall take from Thy creatures my determinate share,",117,4,لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَقَالَ لَأَتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيبًا مَّفْرُوضًا,"It was for this reason that Allah distanced Satan from His mercy. Satan then took an oath before his Lord saying: I will take a set portion of Your servants, whom I will mislead from the truth."
"And mislead them and tempt them, and order them to slit the ears of animals; and order them to alter God's creation."" He who holds Satan as friend in place of God will assuredly be damned to perdition.",118,4,وَلَأُضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلَأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلَءَامُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ ءَاذَانَ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ وَلَءَامُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَّخِذِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ وَلِيًّا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَانًا مُّبِينًا,"He also said: I will block them from your straight path. I will give them hopes with false promises that will make their misguidance seem attractive. I will instruct them to cut the ears of cattle, forbid that which Allah has made lawful, and change Allah’s creation and the natural disposition He made within all creatures. Whoever takes Satan as a friend to follow suffers a clear loss by doing so."
"Whatever the promises he makes, whatever the desires he enkindles, and whatever the hopes Satan rouses in them, are no more than delusion.",119,4,يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا,"Satan makes false promises and gives them false hopes. In reality, he only promises them lies and inspires in them mere hopes that have no reality."
For such the abode is only Hell from which they will find no escape.,120,4,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَا يَجِدُونَ عَنْهَا مَحِيصًا,"The final place for those who follow the footsteps and orders of Satan will be the fire of Hell, from which they will find no place to escape to."
But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever. True is the promise of God; and whose word could be truer than God's?,121,4,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقًّا وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ قِيلًا,"I will enter those who have faith in Me and do good actions that bring them close to Me into gardens with palaces overlooking flowing streams, where they will live eternally. This is a promise from Allah who is true in His promise. No one is more true then Him in His statements and promises."
"It is neither dependent on your wishes, nor the wishes of the people of the Book, (but) whosoever does ill will be punished for it, and will find no protector or friend apart from God;",122,4,لَّيْسَ بِأَمَانِيِّكُمْ وَلَآ أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوٓءًا يُجْزَ بِهِۦ وَلَا يَجِدْ لَهُۥ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"The issue of salvation and success O Muslims is not dependent on mere hopes and desires, nor in what the People of the Scripture hope and wish for; rather, it is based on action. Whoever, from amongst you, does an evil action will be rewarded for it on the Day of Judgement. They will not find any friend to bring any benefit to them nor any helper to protect them from harm."
"But he who performs good deeds, whether man or a woman, and is a believer, will surely enter Paradise, and none shall be deprived even of an iota of his reward.",123,4,وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا,"Any person, whether male or female, who does good actions and has true faith in Allah will enter Paradise, because they combined faith with practice. The reward of their actions will not be reduced in the least, not even to the extent of a speck on a date stone."
"Whose way is better than that of the man who has submitted to God, and does good, and who follows the creed of Abraham the upright? And God chose Abraham as friend.",124,4,وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَٱتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ خَلِيلًا,"No one is better in religion than the one who surrenders to Allah outwardly and inwardly, does good actions and follows the religion of Abraham, which forms the basis of the religion of Muhammad (peace be upon him): inclining away from idolatry and disbelief to monotheism and faith. Allah chose His Prophet Abraham as a close friend from amongst all of His creation."
And all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and everything is well within the compass of God.,125,4,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّحِيطًا,"The dominion of everything in the heavens and the earth is Allah’s alone. Allah, with His knowledge, power and planning, surrounds everything in His creation."
"And they ask you for judgement about women. Tell them: ""God has given you instructions about them. You also read them in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans."" The good you do is known to God.",126,4,وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِى ٱلنِّسَآءِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ فِى يَتَٰمَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ ٱلَّٰتِى لَا تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ وَأَن تَقُومُوا۟ لِلْيَتَٰمَىٰ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِهِۦ عَلِيمًا,"They ask you, O Messenger, about the rights and duties of women. Say: Allah will clarify for you what you have asked and what is recited in the Qur’ān with respect to orphan girls in your care, to whom you do not give the dowry and the inheritance that Allah has ordained for them; and whom you do not wish to marry, yet you prevent them from getting married because of your greed for their wealth. He also explains to you that your duty with respect to minor children who are helpless is to give them their due right of inheritance and not to wrong them by seizing their wealth. He explains to you the duty of being fair to orphans and looking after their best interests in this world and the Afterlife. Allah knows of any good you do towards orphans and others, and will reward you for it."
"If a woman fears aversion from her husband, or ill treatment, there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement; and peace is an excellent thing. But men keep self-interest uppermost. Yet if you do good and fear God, God is cognisant of all that you do.",127,4,وَإِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِنۢ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا أَوْ إِعْرَاضًا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحًا وَٱلصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ وَأُحْضِرَتِ ٱلْأَنفُسُ ٱلشُّحَّ وَإِن تُحْسِنُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا,"If a woman fears that her husband will ignore her and lose interest in her, there is no sin in them reaching a compromise where the woman gives up some of the rights due to her, such as maintenance and accommodation. In such a case, reconciliation is better than divorce. Souls have been naturally created with greed and miserliness, and will not be keen to give up any right. The couple should, therefore, deal with this characteristic by training the soul to be forgiving and generous. If you do good in your affairs and are mindful of Allah, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, then Allah knows what you do. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will reward you accordingly."
"Howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally. But do not incline (to one) exclusively and leave (the other) suspended (as it were). Yet if you do the right thing and are just, God is verily forgiving and kind.",128,4,وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُوٓا۟ أَن تَعْدِلُوا۟ بَيْنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ فَلَا تَمِيلُوا۟ كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ فَتَذَرُوهَا كَٱلْمُعَلَّقَةِ وَإِن تُصْلِحُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"You, husbands, will not be able to be completely fair to your wives with respect to your affection, even if you tried to do so. This is due to circumstances and factors beyond your control. So do not incline fully away from the one you do not love and leave her like a woman suspended, who does not have a husband to fulfill her right and nor is she unmarried so that she may seek to marry another. If you set things right between yourselves, by giving the wife her due right and being mindful of Allah in that regard, then Allah will be Forgiving and Merciful towards you."
"If both (decide to) separate, God in His largesse will provide for them; for God is infinite and all wise.",129,4,وَإِن يَتَفَرَّقَا يُغْنِ ٱللَّهُ كُلًّا مِّن سَعَتِهِۦ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعًا حَكِيمًا,"If a couple separate by divorce (issued by the man) or khul‘ (initiated by the woman), then Allah will make each one of them rich through His vast Bounty: He will enrich the man with a wife that is more suitable for him; and He will enrich the woman with a husband that is more suitable for her. Allah’s bounty and mercy is vast. He is Wise in His planning and decree."
"All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. We had commanded those who received the Book before you, and have commanded you too, to obey the laws of God. Even if you deny, surely all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is self-sufficient and praise-worthy.",130,4,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ وَصَّيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَنِ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَإِن تَكْفُرُوا۟ فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَنِيًّا حَمِيدًا,"The dominion of everything in the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, is Allah’s alone. He had instructed the People of the Scripture, the Jews and Christians, and has instructed you, O believers, to fulfil Allah’s orders and avoid His prohibitions. If you reject this instruction you only harm yourselves, because Allah is in no need of your obedience, as everything in the heavens and earth is His. He is in no need of any of His creation. He is the One Who is praised for all His attributes and actions."
For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is sufficient as guardian.,131,4,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا,The dominion of everything in the heavens and the earth is Allah’s alone and He alone deserves to be obeyed. Allah is sufficient as One Who takes care of all the affairs of His creation.
"He could take you away if He will, O men, and replace you with others: God has the power to do so.",132,4,إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَيَأْتِ بِـَٔاخَرِينَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ قَدِيرًا,"If He wills He can destroy you, O people, and bring others besides you who will obey Him and not go against Him. Allah has full power to do that."
Whosoever desires a reward of this world (should remember) that with God are rewards of this world and the next; and God hears all and sees everything.,133,4,مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ ثَوَابُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعًۢا بَصِيرًا,"Whoever from amongst you, O people, intends to only gain the reward of this world by their actions, they should know that with Allah is the reward of this world and the Afterlife, and they should seek the reward of them both from Him. Allah hears your statements and knows your actions, and He will reward you for them."
"O you who believe, be custodians of justice (and) witnesses for God, even though against yourselves or your parents or your relatives. Whether a man be rich or poor, God is his greater well-wisher than you. So follow not the behests of lust lest you swerve from justice; and if you prevaricate or avoid (giving evidence), God is cognisant of all that you do.",134,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُونُوا۟ قَوَّٰمِينَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ شُهَدَآءَ لِلَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوِ ٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ وَٱلْأَقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيًّا أَوْ فَقِيرًا فَٱللَّهُ أَوْلَىٰ بِهِمَا فَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ ٱلْهَوَىٰٓ أَن تَعْدِلُوا۟ وَإِن تَلْوُۥٓا۟ أَوْ تُعْرِضُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, uphold justice in all conditions: testifying to the truth with respect to every person, even if that means you have to admit a right due on you, your parents or your relatives. A person’s being poor or rich should not make you give or avoid giving testimony, because Allah is closer to the poor or rich person than you are; and He knows what is in their best interests. Do not be led by your desires in your testimony, so that you do not deviate from the truth in it. If you distort the testimony by giving it inaccurately or if you turn away from fulfilling it, then Allah knows what you do."
"O believers, believe in God and His Messenger and the Book He has revealed to His Apostle, and the Books revealed before. But he who believes not in God and His angels and the Books and the prophets and the Last Day, has wandered far away.",135,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِى نَزَّلَ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلَٰٓئِكَتِهِۦ وَكُتُبِهِۦ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلًۢا بَعِيدًا,"O believers, be firm in your faith in Allah, His Messenger, the Qur’ān which He revealed to His Messenger and the books He revealed to the messengers before him. Anyone who disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers and the Day of Judgement has strayed far from the straight path."
"Those who accept the faith, then disbelieve, then return to it, and deny once again and increase in disbelief, will not be forgiven by God or be guided by Him.",136,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا۟ ثُمَّ ءَامَنُوا۟ ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا۟ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُوا۟ كُفْرًا لَّمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلَا لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلًۢا,"Those who repeatedly disbelieve after accepting faith – by entering into the faith, then leaving it, entering into it again, then leaving again, and so on – and then continue in disbelief until they die as disbelievers, Allah will not forgive their sins and nor will He bring them to the straight path that leads to Him."
Give tidings to the hypocrites that painful is their doom.,137,4,بَشِّرِ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"O Prophet, announce to the hypocrites – who show themselves as believers on the outside, but hide disbelief inside – that on the Day of Judgement Allah will give them a painful punishment."
Do those who take unbelievers as their friends in preference to the faithful seek power from them? But all power belongs to God.,138,4,ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّخِذُونَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَإِنَّ ٱلْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا,This punishment is because they took the disbelievers as their helpers and supporters instead of the believers. How strange that they took them as allies!. Do they search for assistance and protection with them? All assistance and protection belongs only to Allah and comes only from Him.
"You have been commanded in the Book that whensoever you hear God's messages denied or derided, do not sit in that company until they begin talking of other things, or you will be no different from them. Indeed God will put the hypocrites and infidels together in Hell.",139,4,وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلَا تَقْعُدُوا۟ مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا۟ فِى حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِّثْلُهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ جَامِعُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعًا,"Allah has already revealed to you, O believers, in the noble Qur’ān that if you are sitting in a gathering and you hear a person disbelieving in Allah’s words starting to make fun of them, then you must not sit with them and you must leave the gathering until they begin speaking about something other than disbelief and making fun of Allah’s words. If you sit with them while you hear them disbelieving in and mocking at Allah’s words, then you are like them in not following Allah’s instruction, because you went against Allah by sitting with them just as they went against Him by disbelieving in Him. Allah will gather the hypocrites, who show themselves as Muslims on the outside but hide disbelief inside themselves, and the disbelievers together in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement."
"Those who wait to see what befalls you, say in ease success comes to you from God: ""Were we not with you?"" But if fortune favours the infidels, they say: ""Did we not overpower you, and yet protected you against the believers?"" But God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and God will never give the unbelievers a way over the faithful.",140,4,ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ قَالُوٓا۟ أَلَمْ نَكُن مَّعَكُمْ وَإِن كَانَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُوٓا۟ أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَلَن يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلًا,"Those who wait to see what happens to you – whether good or bad; or if Allah gives you victory and gains of war – say, ‘Were we not present together with you?’ in order to get some gains of war. If the disbelievers have some success, they say to them, ‘Did we not protect you from and defend you against the believers by assisting you instead of them’. Allah will judge between all of you on the Day of Judgement: rewarding the believers by giving them entry into Paradise and the hypocrites by sending them to the lowest level of the fire of Hell. Allah, in His grace, will never give the disbelievers the upper hand over the believers. Instead, the believers will be the winners in the end."
"The hypocrites try to deceive God, but He (leads them to) deceive themselves. When they stand up for performing the service of prayer they do so indolently, only for show, and remember God but little,",141,4,إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يُخَٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَٰدِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ قَامُوا۟ كُسَالَىٰ يُرَآءُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"The hypocrites try to deceive Allah by showing themselves as believers on the outside while hiding disbelief inside. Allah, in turn, deceives them because He protects their lives despite knowing about their disbelief. In the Afterlife, He has prepared the most severe punishment for them. When they stand for prayer they do so lazily, with reluctance. They only remember Allah a little when they see the believers."
"Wavering between the two, neither with these nor with those. For them who are not given the guidance by God, you will never find a way.",142,4,مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَآ إِلَىٰ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَلَآ إِلَىٰ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُۥ سَبِيلًا,"These hypocrites are wandering and confused. On both the inside and the outside, they are not with the believers, nor with the disbelievers. On the outside, they are with the believers; but inside, they are with the disbelievers. Whoever Allah misleads, you, O Messenger, will never find a way to guide such a person."
"O believers, do not hold unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful. Do you want to proffer a clear proof of your own guilt before God?",143,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجْعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَٰنًا مُّبِينًا,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not take the disbelievers as your close friends instead of the believers. By doing so, do you wish to give Allah clear evidence against you, proving that you are deserving of punishment?"
"The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find none to help them.",144,4,إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ فِى ٱلدَّرْكِ ٱلْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيرًا,Allah will place the hypocrites in the lowest place in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement. You will not find anyone to defend them against the punishment.
"But those who repent and amend, and hold firmly to God, and are sincere and wholly obedient to God, are surely with the faithful; and God will bestow on the faithful a great reward.",145,4,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ وَأَصْلَحُوا۟ وَٱعْتَصَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَأَخْلَصُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ لِلَّهِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَعَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَسَوْفَ يُؤْتِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"But those who turn to Allah repenting from their hypocrisy, correct themselves, hold on to Allah’s pledge and are sincere to Him in their practice, without showing off, such people will be with the believers in this world and the Afterlife. Allah will give the believers a huge reward."
Why should God punish you if you acknowledge the truth and believe? God is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant.,146,4,مَّا يَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابِكُمْ إِن شَكَرْتُمْ وَءَامَنتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ شَاكِرًا عَلِيمًا,"There is no need for Allah to punish you if you are thankful to Him and have faith in Him. He is the One Who is Kind and Merciful. He only punishes you for your sins. If you do good actions, are thankful to Him for His favours and have faith in Him both inside and outside, He will never punish you. Allah is Grateful to the person who admits His favours; and He knows the faith of His creation. He will reward every person for his actions."
"God does not like ill (of others) spoken about, except by him who has been wronged. For God hears all and knows everything.",147,4,لَّا يُحِبُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْجَهْرَ بِٱلسُّوٓءِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ إِلَّا مَن ظُلِمَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعًا عَلِيمًا,"Allah does not like evil statements to be made public. He dislikes that and warns against it. However, if a person is wronged, he may mention the evil in order to complain against the guilty party, to call against him and to retaliate with similar words. In this case, too, it is better for the one who was wronged to be patient and not to disclose the matter. Allah hears your statements and knows your intentions, so be careful of saying or intending anything evil."
"Whether you do some good openly or in secret, or forgive an ill done to you, (know) that God is forgiving and all-powerful.",148,4,إِن تُبْدُوا۟ خَيْرًا أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ أَوْ تَعْفُوا۟ عَن سُوٓءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا قَدِيرًا,"If you expose or hide a good statement or action, or if you pardon the person who does bad to you, Allah is Forgiving and Powerful. So let forgiveness be part of your character in order that Allah forgives you."
"Those who believe not in God and His apostles, and desire to differentiate between God and His messengers, and say: ""We believe in some and not in the others,"" and wish to find a way (between affirmation and denial),",149,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا۟ بَيْنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا۟ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا,"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and who want to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers by believing in Allah yet rejecting His messengers by saying, ‘We accept some messengers and reject others’, and they want to take a path between disbelief and belief, thinking that this will save them."
Are verily the real unbelievers. And We have reserved for unbelievers an ignominious punishment.,150,4,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ حَقًّا وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا,"Those who follow such a stance as regards their faith are in fact disbelievers, for disbelieving in some of the messengers is similar to disbelief in Allah and all His messengers. Allah has prepared a humilating punishment for all disbelievers on the Day of Rising as a just recompense for their deliberate refusal to follow the faith as required of them."
"But those who believe in God and His apostles and make no distinction among any of them, will be given by Him their recompense; for God is forgiving and kind.",151,4,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُوا۟ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ سَوْفَ يُؤْتِيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"Those who believe in Allah, declare His Oneness, do not associate any partner with Him, accept all of His messengers and do not make a distinction between any of them as the disbelievers do, Allah will give such people a great reward for their faith and good actions. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards the servant who repents to Him."
"The people of the Book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven. But of Moses they had asked a bigger thing, and demanded: ""Show us God face to face."" They were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness. Even then they made the calf, when clear signs had reached them. Still We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority.",152,4,يَسْـَٔلُكَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَن تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ كِتَٰبًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَقَدْ سَأَلُوا۟ مُوسَىٰٓ أَكْبَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ فَقَالُوٓا۟ أَرِنَا ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ بِظُلْمِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ فَعَفَوْنَا عَن ذَٰلِكَ وَءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ سُلْطَٰنًا مُّبِينًا,"The Jews ask you, O Messenger, to bring down to them at once a Book from the heaven, as it occurred with Moses, to prove your truthfulness. Do not be surprised at them as their predecessors had asked Moses for something much greater when they asked him to show them Allah openly. As a consequence for what they said they were seized by a thunderbolt. Then Allah brought them back to life and they went on to worship the calf instead of Allah after clear proofs came to them indicating Allah’s Oneness and Him being the only One worthy of worship. Then He forgave them and gave Moses clear evidence against his people."
"We exalted them on the Mount, and they gave a solemn pledge, and We said to them: ""Enter the gates submissively,"" and told them: ""Do not break the Sabbath,"" and took a solemn pledge from them.",153,4,وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ ٱلطُّورَ بِمِيثَٰقِهِمْ وَقُلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ لَا تَعْدُوا۟ فِى ٱلسَّبْتِ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُم مِّيثَٰقًا غَلِيظًا,"I frightened them by raising the mountain over them in order to take a firm promise from them to practice what it contained and we said to them, ‘Enter the gate of Jerusalem in prostration by bowing your heads’. They entered dragging their buttocks. I also said to them, ‘Do not disobey Me by fishing on the Saturday’; but they rebelled and went against My command. I took a firm promise from them for this, but they broke their promise."
"So (they were punished) for breaking the covenant and disbelieving the signs of God, and for killing the prophets unjustly, and saying: ""Our hearts are enfolded in covers,"" (though) in fact God had sealed them because of their unbelief; so they do not believe except a few;",154,4,فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَٰقَهُمْ وَكُفْرِهِم بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتْلِهِمُ ٱلْأَنۢبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌۢ بَلْ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"I distanced them from My mercy because they broke the promise that was taken from them, disbelieved in Allah’s words, boldly killed the prophets and said to Muhammad (peace be upon him), 'Our hearts are covered, so we cannot understand what you say’ That is not the case. Instead, Allah has sealed their hearts so no good reaches them. They only have a little faith, which will not be of any use to them."
And because they denied and spoke dreadful calumnies of Mary;,155,4,وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَٰنًا عَظِيمًا,And I distanced them from My mercy because they disbelieved and because they falsely accused Mary of fornication.
"And for saying: ""We killed the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary, who was an apostle of God;"" but they neither killed nor crucified him, though it so appeared to them. Those who disagree in the matter are only lost in doubt. They have no knowledge about it other than conjecture, for surely they did not kill him,",156,4,وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا ٱلْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُم بِهِۦ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا ٱتِّبَاعَ ٱلظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًۢا,"I cursed them because they proudly, but falsely, said, ‘We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah’. They did not kill him as they claimed, nor did they crucify him; but they killed and crucified a man whom Allah made to resemble Jesus, so they thought the person who was killed was Jesus. Those Jews who claimed to have killed him and those Christians who surrendered him over to them are in doubt and confusion regarding the matter. They have no knowledge, but make guesses that are of no worth against the truth. Truly, they did not kill Jesus nor crucify him."
But God raised him up (in position) and closer to Himself; and God is all-mighty and all-wise.,157,4,بَل رَّفَعَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,"Instead, Allah saved Jesus from their plot and raised him in body and spirit to Himself. Allah is Mighty in His dominion and nothing can overpower Him. He is Wise in His planning, decisions and laws."
There is not one among the people of the Book who will not believe in it before his death; and he will be a witness over them on the Day of Resurrection.,158,4,وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِۦ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِۦ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا,"There is not one of the People of the Scripture except that they will believe in Jesus (peace be upon him) before his death after he descends towards the end of time. On the Day of Judgement, Jesus (peace be upon him) will bear witness against their actions, whether agreeing with the sacred law or not."
"Because of the wickedness of some among the Jews, and because they obstructed people from the way of God, We forbade them many things which were lawful for them;",159,4,فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَٰتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيرًا,"Because of the wrongdoings of the Jews, I prohibited them from some of the pure, edible things that used to be permitted for them, such as any hoofed animal and the fat in cows and sheep. This was also because they blocked themselves and others from Allah’s path, such that obstructing from good became a feature of theirs."
And because they practised usury although it had been forbidden them; and for using others' wealth unjustly. For those who are unbelievers among them We have reserved a painful punishment.,160,4,وَأَخْذِهِمُ ٱلرِّبَوٰا۟ وَقَدْ نُهُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَأَكْلِهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,And because of their dealing in usury after Allah had prohibited them from consuming it and because of their taking the wealth of people without any legitimate right. I have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a punishment causing pain.
"But to the learned among them, and the believers who affirm what has been revealed to you and was revealed to those before you, and to those who fulfil their devotional obligations, who pay the zakat and believe in God and the Last Day, We shall give a great reward.",161,4,لَّٰكِنِ ٱلرَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ مِنْهُمْ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَٱلْمُقِيمِينَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَٱلْمُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ سَنُؤْتِيهِمْ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"But those Jews who are firm and well grounded in knowledge, and have faith, believe in the Qur’ān that Allah has revealed to you, O Messenger, as they believe in the books that He revealed to the messengers before you (such as the Torah and the Gospel). They also establish the prayer, give Zakat of their wealth, accept Allah as the only One worthy of worship without any partner and believe in the Day of Judgement. Allah will give a great reward to those who have these qualities."
"We have sent revelations to you as We sent revelations to Noah and the prophets (who came) after him; and We sent revelations to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob, and their offspring, and to Jesus and Job, and to Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and to David We gave the Book of Psalms,",162,4,إِنَّآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ كَمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلْأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَٰرُونَ وَسُلَيْمَٰنَ وَءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُۥدَ زَبُورًا,"I have sent revelation to you, O Messenger, as I had sent revelation to the prophets before you. This revelation to you is not something strange or unexpected. I had sent revelation to Noah and to the prophets who came after him. I sent revelation to Abraham and his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, and to Jacob, the son of Isaac, and to the Tribes (which refers to the prophets that were from the twelve tribes of the Israelites from the children of Jacob). I also gave David a book called the Psalms."
"And to many an apostle We have mentioned before, and to many other apostles We have not mentioned to you; and to Moses God spoke directly.",163,4,وَرُسُلًا قَدْ قَصَصْنَٰهُمْ عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَرُسُلًا لَّمْ نَقْصُصْهُمْ عَلَيْكَ وَكَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا,"I sent messengers whom I have mentioned to you in the Qur’ān; and I also sent messengers whom I have not mentioned to you in the Qur’ān for a reason. And Allah spoke to Moses without an intermediary in a manner that befits Him, as an honour to Moses."
All these apostles of good news and admonition were sent so that after the apostles men may have no argument against God. God is all-powerful and all-wise.,164,4,رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ حُجَّةٌۢ بَعْدَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,"I sent messengers to give good news of a generous reward for those who have faith in Allah, and to warn those who disbelieve in Him of a painful punishment, so that people will not have any argument to present as an excuse against Me after I have sent the messengers. I am Mighty in My dominion and Wise in My decision."
"God is Himself witness to what has been revealed to you, and revealed with His knowledge, and the angels are witness; and God is sufficient as witness.",165,4,لَّٰكِنِ ٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ أَنزَلَهُۥ بِعِلْمِهِۦ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَشْهَدُونَ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًا,"If the Jews disbelieve in you O Messenger, then Allah bears testimony to the truth of the Qur’ān that He has revealed to you, He has revealed knowledge of His to His servants so that they may know what He willed regarding what He likes and is pleased with, as well as what He dislikes and condemns. Together with Allah’s testimony, the angels also bear testimony to the truth of what you brought. Allah’s testimony is sufficient and no one else’s testimony is required."
"Those who denied and turned away from the path of God, have wandered far astray.",166,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّوا۟ ضَلَٰلًۢا بَعِيدًا,Those who disbelieve in your prophethood and obstruct people from Islam have gone far away from the truth.
"Those who deny and transgress will not be forgiven by God, nor be shown the way",167,4,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَظَلَمُوا۟ لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلَا لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ طَرِيقًا,"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wrong themselves by remaining in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them as long as they continue in disbelief, nor will He guide them to a path of salvation from His punishment,"
"Except to Hell, where they will abide for ever; and this is how (the law of God) works inevitably.",168,4,إِلَّا طَرِيقَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرًا,"Except the path that leads to Hellfire, where they will live eternally. That is easy for Allah and nothing can hinder His decision."
"O men, the Apostle has now come to you, bringing the truth from your Lord; so believe for your own good; but if you deny (then remember) that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is all-knowing and all-wise.",169,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِٱلْحَقِّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَـَٔامِنُوا۟ خَيْرًا لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَكْفُرُوا۟ فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"O people, the Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) has come to you with guidance and the true religion from Allah. So accept what he has brought to you, as this will be better for you in this world and the Afterlife. If you disbelieve in Allah, He is in no need of your faith. Your disbelief does not harm Him, because He controls everything in the heavens, everything in the earth and everything in between. Allah knows who deserves guidance and makes it easy for them. He also knows who does not deserve it and makes them blind to it. He is Wise in His words, actions, laws and decree."
"O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him. So believe in God and His apostles, and do not call Him 'Trinity'. Abstain from this for your own good; for God is only one God, and far from His glory is it to beget a son. All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and sufficient is God for all help.",170,4,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَا تَغْلُوا۟ فِى دِينِكُمْ وَلَا تَقُولُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلْحَقَّ إِنَّمَا ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُۥٓ أَلْقَىٰهَآ إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ فَـَٔامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَلَا تَقُولُوا۟ ثَلَٰثَةٌ ٱنتَهُوا۟ خَيْرًا لَّكُمْ إِنَّمَا ٱللَّهُ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥٓ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ لَّهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا,"Say, O Messenger, to the Christians who received the Gospel: Do not overstep the limits in your religion and do not say anything but the truth about Allah in relation to Jesus. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is only Allah’s messenger sent with the truth. He created him by His word which He sent with Gabriel to Mary, which was the word ‘Be’, and he became. It was a breath from Allah which Gabriel blew with Allah’s instruction. So have faith in Allah and all His messengers without making a distinction between them. Do not say, ‘The gods are three’. Avoid saying this false statement and it will be better for you in this world and the Afterlife. Allah is the only One God free of any partner or child. He is Self-sufficient. The dominion of the heavens, the earth and whatever is in between the two is His. He is sufficient as a guardian to carry out the affairs of His creation."
"The Christ will never disdain to be a votary of God, nor will the angels close to Him. And those who disdain to serve Him and are proud (should remember) that they will all go back to Him in the end.",171,4,لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْدًا لِّلَّهِ وَلَا ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِۦ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيْهِ جَمِيعًا,"Jesus, son of Mary, will never be proud and reject being a servant of Allah. The close angels who do not go against Allah’s instruction and who do as they are instructed will also never disregard being Allah’s servants. How, then, do you take Jesus as a god? How do the idolaters take angels as gods? If anyone rejects worshipping Allah and turns away from it, the He will gather all of them before Him on the Day of Rising and will recompense each one with what they deserve."
"Then those who believed and earned good deeds will be given their recompense in full, and even more out of grace. But those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment. They will find none except God to help them or save them.",172,4,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدُهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَنكَفُوا۟ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فَيُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا وَلَا يَجِدُونَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"Those who have faith in Allah, accept His Messenger and do good actions with sincerity in agreement with the sacred law, He will give them the reward of their actions without any reduction. In addition, He will give them more out of His grace and kindness. As for those who scorned Allah’s worship and obedience and were arrogant, He will punish them with a painful torment. Besides Allah, they will not find any friend to bring any benefit to them nor any helper to protect them from harm."
"O men, you have received infallible proof from your Lord, and We have sent down a beacon light to you.",173,4,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُم بُرْهَٰنٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ نُورًا مُّبِينًا,"O People, a clear proof and plain evidence, which leaves no room for excuse and removes all doubt, has come to you from your Lord. He has sent down to you a clear light in the form of this Qur’ān, which falsehood cannot touch from any angle and which is a revelation from the Wise and Praised One."
"So those who believe in God and hold fast to Him shall indeed be received into His mercy and His grace, and be guided to Him the straight path.",174,4,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱعْتَصَمُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِى رَحْمَةٍ مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَٰطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا,"Those who have faith in Allah and hold on to the Qur’ān that He revealed to their Prophet, Allah will have mercy on them by entering them into Paradise, and He will increase their reward and raise their ranks. He will enable them to tread the straight path which has no crookedness: the path that leads to the gardens of Paradise."
"They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless). Say: ""God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance."" If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything.",175,4,يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى ٱلْكَلَٰلَةِ إِنِ ٱمْرُؤٌا۟ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُۥٓ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهَا وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالًا وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۢ,"They ask you, O Messenger, to give them a ruling with respect to the inheritance of the person who dies without any direct heirs, such as a father or child. Say: Allah explains the ruling with respect to such a person: If a person without any parent or child dies and he has a full sister or a half sister, she will receive half of the wealth he leaves – it being her set share. His full brother or half brother will receive whatever wealth he leaves behind by way of agnation, if there are no stipulated heirs; yet if there are stipulated heirs, he will inherit the balance that remains. If there are two or more full sisters or half sisters, they will inherit two thirds as their set share. If there are male and female (full or half) siblings, they will inherit by way of agnation in accordance with the rule: the male receives equivalent to the share of two females, which means that the share of the male will be double that of the female. Allah explains to you the ruling for the person who dies without direct heirs, as well as other laws of inheritance, so that you do not go astray in this regard. Allah knows everything and nothing is hidden from Him."
"O YOU WHO believe, fulfil your obligations. Made lawful (as food) for you are animals except those mentioned (here); but unlawful during Pilgrimage is game. God ordains whatsoever He wills.",0,5,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَوْفُوا۟ بِٱلْعُقُودِ أُحِلَّتْ لَكُم بَهِيمَةُ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ غَيْرَ مُحِلِّى ٱلصَّيْدِ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ,"O you who believe in Allah, follow His Messenger and practice His laws, fulfil the firm promises of faith and practice that were made between you and your Creator. Also, fulfil the promises made with His creation in sale transactions, marriage, etc. Allah has permitted for you, out of His mercy, livestock animals (camels, cattle, sheep and goats), except those the prohibition of which have been read to you and the land game that He has prohibited you from in the state of sanctity during the pilgrimage of Hajj or Umrah. Allah decides to permit and prohibit as He wills in accordance with His wisdom. No one can compel Him or object to His decision."
"O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure. Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.",1,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُحِلُّوا۟ شَعَٰٓئِرَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا ٱلشَّهْرَ ٱلْحَرَامَ وَلَا ٱلْهَدْىَ وَلَا ٱلْقَلَٰٓئِدَ وَلَآ ءَآمِّينَ ٱلْبَيْتَ ٱلْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَٰنًا وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَٱصْطَادُوا۟ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَـَٔانُ قَوْمٍ أَن صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ أَن تَعْتَدُوا۟ وَتَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"O you who believe in Allah, follow His Messenger and practice His laws, do not violate the sanctity of those things that Allah has instructed you to honour. Stay away from those things that are prohibited when you are in the state of pilgrim sanctity, such as wearing your normal clothing, and those things that are prohibited within the Sanctuary, such as hunting. Do not regard fighting in the sacred months of Dhū Al-Qa‘dah, Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram and Rajab to be permissible. Do not violate the sacrificial animal by siezing it or preventing it from reaching its place of sacrifice. Do not violate those animals with garlands indicating that they are offerings. Do not violate those intending to go to the Sacred House of Allah, seeking profit in their trade and Allah’s pleasure. When you come out of the state of pilgrim sanctity and you leave the Sanctuary, you may hunt if you wish. The hatred for a people who prevented you from the Sacred Mosque should not cause you to be oppressive and unfair towards them. Help one another, O believers, to do what you have been instructed and to leave what you have been prohibited from. Fear Allah by holding on to His obedience and avoiding His disobedience. Allah’s punishment for the one who disobeys Him is severe, so be careful of it."
"Forbidden you is carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and whatsoever has been killed in the name of some other than God, and whatever has been strangled, or killed by a blow or a fall, or by goring, or that which has been mauled by wild beasts unless slaughtered while still alive; and that which has been slaughtered at altars is forbidden, and also dividing the meat by casting lots with arrows. All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you. If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind.",2,5,حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسْتَقْسِمُوا۟ بِٱلْأَزْلَٰمِ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمَ دِينًا فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِى مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِّإِثْمٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah has forbidden you from eating those animals that die without being ritually slaughtered. He has also forbidden you from spilled blood; pig’s meat; an animal on which other than the name of Allah was taken at the time of slaughter; an animal that was strangled or beaten to death, or one that fell from a high place; or an animal that was gored by another animal and an animal that was hunted by a predator, such as a lion, tiger or wolf, unless you reach any of these animals while they are alive and you slaughter them – in which case they will be lawful for you. He has forbidden you from those animals that were sacrificed for idols. He has also prohibited you from drawing lots to know whether something is destined for you or not, or to use as a means of making a decision when intending to do something or not. By doing these prohibited things a person is leaving obedience to Allah. Today the disbelievers have lost hope that you will leave the religion of Islam, because they see its strength. So do not fear them, but fear Me alone. Today I have perfected for you your religion, which is Islam. I have completed My apparent and hidden favours on you. I have selected Islam as your religion, so I will not accept any other. If anyone is forced due to hunger to eat from an animal that was not slaughtered correctly, with no inclination to sin, there is no sin on such a person to do so. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate."
"They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: ""All things are lawful for you that are clean, and what the trained hunting animals take for you as you have trained then, in the light of God's teachings, but read over them the name of God, and fear (straying from the path of) God, for God is swift in the reckoning.""",3,5,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ مَاذَآ أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتُ وَمَا عَلَّمْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّآ أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Your companions ask you, O Messenger, what Allah has permitted them to eat. Say, O Messenger: Allah has permitted you to eat any food that is pure and also what is hunted by trained animals that have canines, such as dogs, cheetahs, or birds that have talons such as falcons. These are animals that you train to hunt as Allah has blessed you with knowledge of its methods, such that they follow instructions and leave something when told to do so. You may eat any game caught by such animals, even if they kill them, as long as you take the name of Allah when releasing them. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and staying away from His prohibitions. Allah is quick in taking account."
"On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come.",4,5,ٱلْيَوْمَ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتُ وَطَعَامُ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ وَطَعَامُكُمْ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتُ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ إِذَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحِينَ وَلَا مُتَّخِذِىٓ أَخْدَانٍ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلْإِيمَٰنِ فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُۥ وَهُوَ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Today Allah has allowed you to eat those things that are wholesome, and the animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians who are the People of the Scripture. He has also made lawful for them animals that you slaughter. He has permitted you to marry free, chaste women from the believers, as well as free, chaste women from the Jews and Christians who received scripture before you. This is if you give them their dowries and you are trying to stay away from committing an immoral action, such as adultery or fornication, by taking them as lovers. Yet whosoever disbelieves in Allah and His laws which He has given to his slaves, then his actions are void, because the condition for good actions to be accepted is true faith. On the Day of Judgement, such a person will be a loser due to entering the fire of Hell, where they will live eternally."
"O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you. He wishes to purify you, and grace you with His favours in full so that you may be grateful.",5,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ فَٱغْسِلُوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْمَرَافِقِ وَٱمْسَحُوا۟ بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْكَعْبَيْنِ وَإِن كُنتُمْ جُنُبًا فَٱطَّهَّرُوا۟ وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَىٰٓ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنكُم مِّنَ ٱلْغَآئِطِ أَوْ لَٰمَسْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُوا۟ مَآءً فَتَيَمَّمُوا۟ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَٱمْسَحُوا۟ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُم مِّنْهُ مَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ وَلَٰكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهِّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah, follow His Messenger and practice His laws, when you intend to stand up to offer the prayer and you are in the state of minor ritual impurity, then perform ablution by washing your faces and then your hands together with the elbows, then wiping your heads and finally washing your feet together with the ankles. If you are in the state of major ritual impurity, then take a full bath. If you are sick and you fear that the sickness will get worse or the healing will be delayed, or if you are on a journey even though you are not sick, or if you are in the state of minor ritual impurity, such as after going to the toilet, or in a state of major ritual impurity, such as after having had sexual intercourse, and you do not find water to purify yourselves with, despite having searched for it, then make use of the ground by striking it with your hands and then wiping over your faces and then wiping your hands with it. Allah does not wish to make the laws difficult for you by forcing you to use water that may lead to harm or difficulty. He has therefore given you a substitute when this is not possible due to sickness or the lack of water. This is a completion of His favour on you, so that you give thanks for such favour and are not ungrateful."
"Remember the favours He bestowed on you, and the covenant He cemented with you, when you said: ""We have heard and obey."" Have fear of God, for He knows the secrets of your heart.",6,5,وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَٰقَهُ ٱلَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِۦٓ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Remember Allah’s favour upon you by guiding you to Islam and the promise He took from you when you said at the time of pledging allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him) to listen and follow in ease or difficulty: ‘We hear your words and we follow your instruction’. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions, including His promises, and avoiding His prohibitions. Allah knows what is in the hearts and nothing is hidden from Him."
"O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God. Surely God is aware of all you do.",7,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُونُوا۟ قَوَّٰمِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَآءَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَـَٔانُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰٓ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا۟ ٱعْدِلُوا۟ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger and follow His laws, uphold Allah’s rights over you, seeking His pleasure. Be witnesses for justice and not for oppression. The hatred for a people should not make you leave justice: justice is a requirement with a friend, as well as with an enemy, so be just with both. Justice is closer to the fear of Allah, and oppression is closer to disrespect against Him. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Allah knows what you do. Nothing of your actions is hidden from Him and He will repay you accordingly."
God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds.,8,5,وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,Allah has made a promise to those who have faith in Allah and His messengers of forgiveness for their sins and a great reward which is to enter into Paradise. Allah never fails His Promise.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the people of Hell.,9,5,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Those who disbelieve in Allah and reject His verses are the companions of the fire of Hell, which they will enter as a punishment for their disbelief and rejection. They will remain in the fire of Hell eternally, just as a companion remains with his companion."
"O believers, remember the favours God bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and He restrained their hands. So fear God; and the faithful should place their trust in God.",10,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَن يَبْسُطُوٓا۟ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, remember, with your hearts and tongues, the favours Allah has given you, such as safety and the placing of fear in the hearts of your enemies, when they intended to stretch their hands towards you in order to attack you. Allah turned them away from you and protected you from them. Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Let the believers place their reliance in Allah alone, in order to achieve their religious and worldly interests."
"God covenanted the people of Israel and raised twelve leaders among them, and said: ""I shall verily be with you. If you fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat and believe in My apostles and support them, and give a goodly loan to God, I shall certainly absolve you of your evil, and admit you to gardens with streams of running water. But whosoever among you denies after this, will have wandered away from the right path.""",11,5,وَلَقَدْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَٰقَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَبَعَثْنَا مِنْهُمُ ٱثْنَىْ عَشَرَ نَقِيبًا وَقَالَ ٱللَّهُ إِنِّى مَعَكُمْ لَئِنْ أَقَمْتُمُ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَيْتُمُ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَءَامَنتُم بِرُسُلِى وَعَزَّرْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَقْرَضْتُمُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا لَّأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنكُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَلَأُدْخِلَنَّكُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ فَمَن كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"Allah had taken a firm promise from the Children of Israel, when He appointed over them twelve chiefs who were placed in authority over them. Allah said to the Israelites: I am with you- with my help and support if you establish the prayer in the complete manner, give Zakat from your wealth, accept all of my messengers without distinction, honour them, assist them and spend in good causes. If you do all of this, I will wipe out the sins you commit and I will enter you, on the Day of Judgement, into gardens with palaces overlooking flowing streams. Whoever disbelieves after making this promise has knowingly and deliberately deviated from the path of truth."
"When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts. So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against. You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few. But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good.",12,5,فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَٰقَهُمْ لَعَنَّٰهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا قُلُوبَهُمْ قَٰسِيَةً يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِۦ وَنَسُوا۟ حَظًّا مِّمَّا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَلَا تَزَالُ تَطَّلِعُ عَلَىٰ خَآئِنَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنْهُمْ فَٱعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَٱصْفَحْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Because of their breaking the promise that was taken from them, I distanced them from My mercy and I made their hearts so hard that no good could enter them and no advice could be of any benefit to them. They distort the placing of words by replacing them with other words, and by interpreting them according to their desires. They also left out practicing some of what they were advised to do. You will continuously discover, O Messenger, their betrayal of Allah and His believing servants, with the exception of a few of them, who fulfil the promise taken from them. So pardon them and do not take them to task. Overlook what they do, because that is being good and Allah loves those who do good."
"We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing.",13,5,وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا نَصَٰرَىٰٓ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَهُمْ فَنَسُوا۟ حَظًّا مِّمَّا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَأَغْرَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَسَوْفَ يُنَبِّئُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَصْنَعُونَ,"Just as I took a firm promise from the Jews, I also took a promise from those who declare themselves to be pure followers of Jesus (peace be upon him). They also left out practicing some of what they were advised to do, just as their predecessors from among the jews did. I then placed enmity and hatred between them and they began fighting and killing one another, each one declaring the other to be a disbeliever. Allah will inform them about what they used to do and will repay them for the same."
"O people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you, announcing many things of the Scriptures that you have suppressed, passing over some others. To you has come light and a clear Book from God",14,5,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا كُنتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَيَعْفُوا۟ عَن كَثِيرٍ قَدْ جَآءَكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَٰبٌ مُّبِينٌ,"O People of the Scripture – referring to the Jews who had the Torah and the Christians who had the Gospel – My messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) has come to you to explain much of what you hide from the scripture revealed to you, and to overlook much of that in which there is no benefit besides disgracing you. The Qur’ān has come to you as a Book from Allah, which is a light to guide you and a Book that makes clear all of what people require for their worldly and religious affairs."
"Through which God will lead those who follow His pleasure to the path of peace, and guide them out of darkness into light by His will, and to the path that is straight.",15,5,يَهْدِى بِهِ ٱللَّهُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَٰنَهُۥ سُبُلَ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ وَيُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِۦ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"By this Book, Allah guides the person who follows faith and does good actions, which please Him, to the paths of safety from Allah’s punishment. These are the paths that lead to Paradise. He removes them from the darkness of disbelief and disobedience to the light of faith and obedience, and He guides them to the straight path: the path of Islam."
"Verily they are unbelievers who say: ""The Messiah, son of Mary, is God."" You ask them: ""Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?"" For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things.",16,5,لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ قُلْ فَمَن يَمْلِكُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا إِنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُهْلِكَ ٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُۥ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Those Christians who say that ‘Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary’ have committed disbelief. Say to them, O Messenger: Who is able to prevent Allah from destroying the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, as well as his mother and all of those on earth if He wishes to do so? If no one is able to stop Allah from this, it is a clear indication that there is no god but Allah and that all of those people – Jesus, son of Mary, his mother and all of creation – are all Allah’s creation. The dominion of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, is Allah’s. He creates whatever He wishes and one such creation of His was Jesus (peace be upon him), who was His servant and messenger. Allah is able to do all things. nothing is outside His ability. He created Adam without a father or mother. He created Eve without a mother and He created Jesus without a father."
"Say the Jews and the Christians: ""We are sons of God and beloved of Him."" Say: ""Why does He punish you then for your sins? No: You are only mortals, of His creation."" He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him.",17,5,وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ نَحْنُ أَبْنَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّٰٓؤُهُۥ قُلْ فَلِمَ يُعَذِّبُكُم بِذُنُوبِكُم بَلْ أَنتُم بَشَرٌ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقَ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Both the Jews and the Christians claimed: ‘We are Allah’s children and loved ones’. Say, O Messenger, in refutation of their claim: Why does Allah punish you for the sins you commit? If you were His loved ones, as you claim, He would not have punished you, by your being killed or disfigured in the world, and by means of the fire of Hell in the Afterlife, because He does not punish those He loves. Instead, you are just like all other human beings. If any of them do good, Allah will reward them with Paradise. If any of them do evil, He will punish them in the fire of Hell. Allah forgives whomever He wishes through His grace; and He punishes whomever He wishes through His justice. The dominion of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is in between them, is Allah’s alone. To Him alone is the return."
"O you people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: ""There did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings."" So now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for God has the power over all things.",18,5,يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَىٰ فَتْرَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنۢ بَشِيرٍ وَلَا نَذِيرٍ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُم بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, My messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) has come to you after a period when there were no messengers and when there was a real need for his mission, so that you do not say as an excuse, ‘No messenger came to us bringing good news of Allah’s reward nor any warning of His punishment’. Muhammad (peace be upon him) has come to you to give you good news of My reward and warn you of My punishment. I am able to do all things. Nothing is outside My ability. It is through My power that I sent the messengers and I sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final messenger."
"Remember when Moses said to his people: ""O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world.",19,5,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِۦ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَعَلَ فِيكُمْ أَنۢبِيَآءَ وَجَعَلَكُم مُّلُوكًا وَءَاتَىٰكُم مَّا لَمْ يُؤْتِ أَحَدًا مِّنَ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Moses said to his people, the Israelites, ‘O People, remember, with your hearts and tongues, Allah’s favour to you when He made prophets amongst you calling you to guidance, made you kings in control of your affairs after you were subjugated slaves, and gave you such favours that He had not given to any other people in your time’."
"Enter then, my people, the Holy Land that God has ordained for you, and do not turn back, or you will suffer.""",20,5,يَٰقَوْمِ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْضَ ٱلْمُقَدَّسَةَ ٱلَّتِى كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَرْتَدُّوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَدْبَارِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُوا۟ خَٰسِرِينَ,"Moses said, ‘O People, enter the land that has been purified – Jerusalem and the surrounding area – which Allah has promised that you will enter, and fight the disbelievers in it. Do not become weak before the tyrants, because you will then end up as losers in the world and the Afterlife’."
"They said: ""O Moses, in that land live a people who are formidable; we shall never go there until they leave. We shall enter when they go away.""",21,5,قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّ فِيهَا قَوْمًا جَبَّارِينَ وَإِنَّا لَن نَّدْخُلَهَا حَتَّىٰ يَخْرُجُوا۟ مِنْهَا فَإِن يَخْرُجُوا۟ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّا دَٰخِلُونَ,"His people said to him, ‘O Moses, in the Holy Land there is a powerful and mighty people and this is preventing us from entering it. We will not enter it as long as these people are there, because we do not have the ability to fight them. If they leave, we will go in’."
"Then two of the men who feared (God), and to whom God was gracious, said to them: ""Charge and rush the gate. If you enter, you will surely be victorious. And place your trust in God if you truly believe.""",22,5,قَالَ رَجُلَانِ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمَا ٱدْخُلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْبَابَ فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمُوهُ فَإِنَّكُمْ غَٰلِبُونَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوٓا۟ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Two men from the companions of Moses who feared Allah and were afraid of His punishment, whom Allah had blessed by enabling them to obey Him, urged their people to fulfil the instruction of Moses and said, ‘Enter the gate of the city against the tyrants. Once you go through the gate you will – by Allah’s permission – defeat them, as Allah’s custom is to give victory after the means of having faith and making preparation are adopted. Place your reliance and trust in Allah alone, if you truly have faith. Faith in Allah requires you to rely on Him’."
"They said: ""O Moses, we shall never, never enter so long as they are there. Go you and your Lord to fight them; we stay here.""",23,5,قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّا لَن نَّدْخُلَهَآ أَبَدًا مَّا دَامُوا۟ فِيهَا فَٱذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَرَبُّكَ فَقَٰتِلَآ إِنَّا هَٰهُنَا قَٰعِدُونَ,"The Children of Israel insisted on going against the instruction of their prophet, Moses, and said, ‘We will never enter the city as long as the tyrants are there. So you, O Moses, and your Lord go and fight the tyrants. We will remain sitting here and will not join you in the fight’."
"Said (Moses): ""O Lord, I have control over none but myself and my brother; so distinguish between us and these, the wicked people.""",24,5,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى لَآ أَمْلِكُ إِلَّا نَفْسِى وَأَخِى فَٱفْرُقْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Moses said to his Lord, ‘O Lord, I have no authority over anyone besides myself and my brother, Aaron. So separate us from those who do not obey You and Your messenger’."
"(And God) said: ""Then verily this land is forbidden them for forty years, and they shall wander perplexed over the earth. So do not grieve for these, the wicked people.""",25,5,قَالَ فَإِنَّهَا مُحَرَّمَةٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً يَتِيهُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَلَا تَأْسَ عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Allah said to His Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), ‘Allah has forbidden entry into the Holy Land for the Israelites for a period of forty years, in which they will wander on earth aimlessly without direction. Do not grieve, O Moses, over those who do not follow Allah, because the punishment they receive is because of their sins’."
"Narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of Adam. When each of them offered a sacrifice (to God), that of one was accepted, and that of the other was not. Said (the one): ""I will murder you,"" and the other replied: ""God only accepts from those who are upright and preserve themselves from evil.",26,5,وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱبْنَىْ ءَادَمَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِذْ قَرَّبَا قُرْبَانًا فَتُقُبِّلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِمَا وَلَمْ يُتَقَبَّلْ مِنَ ٱلْءَاخَرِ قَالَ لَأَقْتُلَنَّكَ قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Relate with the truth O Messenger, to these Jews who are jealous and who do wrong, the incident of the two sons of Adam, Cain and Abel, When they both offered a sacrifice to gain closeness to Allah, Allah accepted the sacrifice offered by Abel because he was mindful of Him and did not accept the offering of Cain because he was not mindful of Allah. Cain was unhappy about the fact that Abel’s sacrifice was accepted and jealously said, ‘I will kill you, O Abel!’ Abel replied, ‘Allah only accepts the offering of the one who is mindful of Him by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions’."
"If you raise your hand to kill me, I will raise not mine to kill you, for I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds;",27,5,لَئِنۢ بَسَطتَ إِلَىَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِى مَآ أَنَا۠ بِبَاسِطٍ يَدِىَ إِلَيْكَ لِأَقْتُلَكَ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"If you lift your hand intending to kill me, I will not do the same as you. It is not because I am a coward, but because I fear Allah the Lord of all created things."
"I would rather you suffered the punishment for sinning against me, and for your own sin, and became an inmate of Hell. And that is the requital for the unjust.""",28,5,إِنِّىٓ أُرِيدُ أَن تَبُوٓأَ بِإِثْمِى وَإِثْمِكَ فَتَكُونَ مِنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلنَّارِ وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"I want you to return with the sin of wrongly killing me, together with your previous sins, and become one of those who will enter the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement and remain there. That is the reward of those who overstep the limits of Allah. I do not want to take on your crime and become one of the sinners."
"Then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother, and he killed him, and became one of the damned.",29,5,فَطَوَّعَتْ لَهُۥ نَفْسُهُۥ قَتْلَ أَخِيهِ فَقَتَلَهُۥ فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"The evil prompting soul of Cain persuaded him to wrongly kill his brother, Abel. So he killed him and because of that he became one of those who are losers in this world and the Afterlife. He set a bad example and will therefore bear that burden, as well as the burden of any person who does the same until the Day of Judgement, without any reduction in the burden of those who imitate him."
"Then God sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how to hide the nakedness of his brother. ""Alas, the woe,"" said he, ""that I could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother,"" and was filled with remorse.",30,5,فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ غُرَابًا يَبْحَثُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لِيُرِيَهُۥ كَيْفَ يُوَٰرِى سَوْءَةَ أَخِيهِ قَالَ يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰٓ أَعَجَزْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِثْلَ هَٰذَا ٱلْغُرَابِ فَأُوَٰرِىَ سَوْءَةَ أَخِى فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ ٱلنَّٰدِمِينَ,Allah sent a crow to dig the earth in front of him to bury another dead crow and teach him how to cover his brother’s body. He then became regretful. Regret is the end result of those who commit sins.
"That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race. Our apostles brought clear proofs to them; but even after that most of them committed excesses in the land.",31,5,مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ أَنَّهُۥ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًۢا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَآ أَحْيَا ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ,"Due to Cain’s murder of his brother, I informed the Israelites that any person who kills another person for no valid reason – such as legal retribution or as punishment for causing corruption in the land by treason or waging war – it is as if he has killed all people, since he did not make a distinction between an innocent and a guilty person. Whoever refrains from killing a person whose soul I have made sacred, and regards it to be forbidden to kill such a person, it is as if he has given life to all people, because in such an action lies the safety of all people. My messengers brought to the Israelites clear signs and evidences. Despite this many of them overstepped My limits by committing sins and going against the messengers."
"The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and perpetrate disorders in the land, is to kill or hang them, or have a hand on one side and a foot on the other cut off, or banish them from the land. Such is their disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter their doom shall be dreadful.",32,5,إِنَّمَا جَزَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا أَن يُقَتَّلُوٓا۟ أَوْ يُصَلَّبُوٓا۟ أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم مِّنْ خِلَٰفٍ أَوْ يُنفَوْا۟ مِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ ذَٰلِكَ لَهُمْ خِزْىٌ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and who challenge them by spreading corruption on earth though killing, looting and creating fear on the roads, is that they be killed, or crucified, or that they have their alternate hands and feet cut off, and if the offence is repeated the left hands and right feet are to be cut off, or they are to be exiled. Such punishment is a disgrace for them in the world; and in the Afterlife, they will receive a great punishment –"
But those who repent before they are subdued should know that God is forgiving and kind.,33,5,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَقْدِرُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Except for those warmongers who repent before you, people of authority, get hold of them. Know, then, that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards them after they repent. Due to His mercy, He overlooks the punishment that is due to them."
"O you who believe, follow the path shown to you by God, and seek the way of proximity to Him, and struggle in His way: you may have success.",34,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱبْتَغُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ وَجَٰهِدُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, search for a means of closeness to Him by doing what He instructs you to do and staying away from what He prohibits you from, and strive against the disbelievers for His pleasure so that you get what you desire and you are saved from what you fear."
"As for unbelievers, if they possess the riches of the whole earth, and two times more, and offer it as ransom for release from the torments of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and their punishment will surely be painful.",35,5,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُۥ مَعَهُۥ لِيَفْتَدُوا۟ بِهِۦ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مَا تُقُبِّلَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Had those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers owned everything in the earth and the likeness of it and gave all of that to ransom themselves from Allah’s punishment on the Day of Judgement, such ransom will not be accepted from them. And they will receive a painful punishment."
"They would like to escape from the Fire, but will never succeed, and their suffering will be constant",36,5,يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَخْرُجُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَمَا هُم بِخَٰرِجِينَ مِنْهَا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,"They will want to leave the fire of Hell after they enter it. But how can that happen? They will never come out of it. Instead, they will always remain in it and they will receive a continuous punishment."
"As for the thief, whether man or woman, cut his hand as punishment from God for what he had done; and God is all mighty and all wise.",37,5,وَٱلسَّارِقُ وَٱلسَّارِقَةُ فَٱقْطَعُوٓا۟ أَيْدِيَهُمَا جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَسَبَا نَكَٰلًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"As for those who are caught stealing, those in authority are to cut off the right hand of the male and female thief as a punishment from Allah for the crime of wrongfully taking people’s wealth, and to serve as a lesson and deterrent for them, as well as others. Allah is Mighty and nothing can overpower His decree. He is Wise in His decree and legislation."
"But those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God, for God is forgiving and kind.",38,5,فَمَن تَابَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ظُلْمِهِۦ وَأَصْلَحَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Whoever repents to Allah from the crime of theft and sets right his action, then Allah, out of His grace, will accept His repentance. That is because Allah forgives the sins of those who repent to Him and is Merciful towards them. However if such a matter were to reach the court of law the legal punishment cannot be dismissed by repentance."
"Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will, and pardons whom He please, for God has the power over all things.",39,5,أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"You, O Messenger, certainly know that the dominion of the heavens and the earth is Allah’s. He acts in them as He wishes. He punishes whomever He wishes through His justice; and forgives whomever He wishes through His grace. Allah is able to do all things and nothing is outside His ability."
"Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: ""We believe,"" but do not believe in their hearts. And those of the Jews who listen to tell lies, and spy on behalf of others who do not come to you, and who distort the words (of the Torah) out of context, and say: ""If you are given (what we say is true) accept it; but if you are not given it, beware."" You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way. These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify. For them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next --",40,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرَّسُولُ لَا يَحْزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْكُفْرِ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قُلُوبُهُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ سَمَّٰعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ سَمَّٰعُونَ لِقَوْمٍ ءَاخَرِينَ لَمْ يَأْتُوكَ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَوَاضِعِهِۦ يَقُولُونَ إِنْ أُوتِيتُمْ هَٰذَا فَخُذُوهُ وَإِن لَّمْ تُؤْتَوْهُ فَٱحْذَرُوا۟ وَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُۥ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُطَهِّرَ قُلُوبَهُمْ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْىٌ وَلَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"O Messenger, do not be made sad by those who rush to announce their disbelief of you and the revelation that you brought. These were the hypocrites who professed faith on the outside, but hid disbelief on the inside. They were also some Jews who eagerly listened to the lies of their leaders, who distort the truth having ignored you and have not come to you out of pride. They distort the words of Allah in the Torah and change it to suit their desires. They say to their followers, ‘If the law of Muhammad conforms to your desires, follow it; and if it does not conform, then be careful of it’. If Allah wills to misguide any person, you, O Messenger, will never find anyone who will be able to save them from misguidance and guide them to the path of truth. Such hypocrites and Jews, who have these qualities, are the ones whose hearts Allah has not intended to purify from disbelief. In the world, they will receive humiliation and shame; and in the Afterlife, they will receive a great punishment: the fire of Hell."
"Eavesdropping for telling lies, earning through unlawful means! So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline. And if you decline, they can do you no harm; but if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just.",41,5,سَمَّٰعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ أَكَّٰلُونَ لِلسُّحْتِ فَإِن جَآءُوكَ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُمْ أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَإِن تُعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ فَلَن يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْـًٔا وَإِنْ حَكَمْتَ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْقِسْطِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,"These Jews frequently listen to lies and consume unlawful wealth, such as usury. If they bring a case before you for judgement, O Messenger, then pass judgement between them if you wish, or leave off passing judgement if you so wish – you have the option of doing either of these. If you choose not to pass judgement, they will not be able to harm you in any way. If you do pass judgement, then do so with justice, even though they themselves are unfair and are your enemies. Allah loves those who are just in their judgements, even though the case is between those who are the judge’s enemies."
But why should they make you a judge when the Torah is with them which contains the Law of God? Even then they turn away. They are those who will never believe.,42,5,وَكَيْفَ يُحَكِّمُونَكَ وَعِندَهُمُ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةُ فِيهَا حُكْمُ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَمَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"These people are strange. They disbelieve you, but come to you for judgement hoping that you will pass judgement in accordance with their desires, whereas they have the Torah with them, which they claim to have faith in and which contains Allah’s law. They, then, ignore your judgement when it does not suit their desires. So they have denied what is in their scripture as well as ignored your judgement. The action of such people is not that of people of faith and they therefore do not have faith in you and what you brought."
"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God's writ. So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed.",43,5,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلرَّبَّٰنِيُّونَ وَٱلْأَحْبَارُ بِمَا ٱسْتُحْفِظُوا۟ مِن كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَآءَ فَلَا تَخْشَوُا۟ ٱلنَّاسَ وَٱخْشَوْنِ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِى ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"I sent down the Torah to Moses (peace be upon him) containing guidance towards good and a light to make things clear. Judgement was given in accordance with it by the prophets of the Israelites, who had devoted themselves to following Me, as well as by the scholars who used to teach people because I had entrusted them with My book and made them guardians to preserve and protect it from distortion or change. They are witnesses that it is the truth and people refer to them with respect to it. So, Jews, do not fear people, but fear Me alone; and do not take in exchange for judgement in accordance with what I have revealed a small price of leadership, fame or wealth. Whoever does not pass judgement in accordance with what I have revealed and considers this to be lawful, better or equal to My judgement, then such people are truly disbelievers."
"And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust.",44,5,وَكَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيهَآ أَنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ بِٱلنَّفْسِ وَٱلْعَيْنَ بِٱلْعَيْنِ وَٱلْأَنفَ بِٱلْأَنفِ وَٱلْأُذُنَ بِٱلْأُذُنِ وَٱلسِّنَّ بِٱلسِّنِّ وَٱلْجُرُوحَ قِصَاصٌ فَمَن تَصَدَّقَ بِهِۦ فَهُوَ كَفَّارَةٌ لَّهُۥ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"I ordered the Jews in the Torah that if any person deliberately and wrongfully kills another he will be killed in retribution. If any person deliberately removes the eye of another person, his eye will be removed. If any person cuts the nose of another person, his nose will be cut. If any person cuts the ear of another person, his ear will be cut. If any person removes the tooth of another person, his tooth will be removed. I also ordered them with respect to wounds that the offender will be penalised with retribution for his offence. Whoever voluntarily pardons the offender, then such pardon shall be a compensation for their sins, as they have pardoned one who has wronged them. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed with respect to the law of retribution and other laws, then such person has overstepped Allah’s limits."
"Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path.",45,5,وَقَفَّيْنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِم بِعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ ٱلْإِنجِيلَ فِيهِ هُدًى وَنُورٌ وَمُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"After the prophets of the Israelites, I sent Jesus, son of Mary, as a believer in the Torah, giving judgement in accordance with it. I also gave him the Gospel that contained guidance to the truth and evidences to remove doubts and solve difficult cases of rulings: it corresponded to the Torah that came before it, except in a few rulings that it replaced. I made the Gospel a guide and a means to restrain people from doing that which was prohibited."
Let the people of the Gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by God. And those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are transgressors.,46,5,وَلْيَحْكُمْ أَهْلُ ٱلْإِنجِيلِ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"The Christians should believe in what Allah has revealed in the Gospel and they should judge in accordance with the truth it contains prior to the coming of Muhammad (peace be upon him). Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down, then such people are the ones who do not follow Allah and leave the truth for falsehood."
"And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance.",47,5,وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ عَمَّا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَلَٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ فَٱسْتَبِقُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,"I sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’ān with the truth about which there is no doubt that it is from Allah. It is a confirmation and guardian for the revealed books that came before it. Whatever in those books conforms to it is the truth, and whatever does not is false. So judge between people according to what I have revealed to you in it and do not follow their desires which they have adopted in leaving the truth that has been revealed to you about which there is no doubt. I have made a sacred law and clear path for every nation. If I willed to make all the laws one, I would have done so. But I made a separate law for every nation in order to test them all and to see who follows and who does not. So rush towards doing good actions and leave evil ones. Your return on the Day of Judgement is to Me alone. I will inform you about that which you used to differ in and will repay you for the actions you did."
"Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God. If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors.",48,5,وَأَنِ ٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَٱحْذَرْهُمْ أَن يَفْتِنُوكَ عَنۢ بَعْضِ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُصِيبَهُم بِبَعْضِ ذُنُوبِهِمْ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَفَٰسِقُونَ,"Judge between them, O Messenger, in accordance with what Allah has revealed to you! Do not follow their opinions that arise from following their desires. Be careful that they do not mislead you from some of what Allah has revealed to you. They will leave no stone unturned in an attempt to do just that. If they turn away from accepting judgement in accordance with what Allah has sent down to you, then know that Allah only intends to punish them for some of their sins in this world. In the Afterlife, He will punish them for all of their sins. There are many people who do not follow Allah’s laws."
Do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance? But who could be a better judge than God for those who are firm in their faith?,49,5,أَفَحُكْمَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَبْغُونَ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حُكْمًا لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,"Do they ignore your judgement seeking the judgement of the idolaters from the period of ignorance who pass judgement according to their desires? In the sight of those who have conviction and who understand that which Allah has sent to His prophet, there can be no one better in judgement than Allah; but not in the sight of those who are ignorant and who only follow their desires, even though they may be false."
"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.",50,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُۥ مِنْهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not take the Jews and Christians as your allies and close friends whom you support. The Jews will only support those of their religion, and the Christians will do the same. Both groups will unite against you. Whoever from you takes them as friends is one of them. Allah does not guide those who do wrong by supporting the disbelievers."
"You will notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness (of doubt) only hasten to join them and say: ""We fear lest misfortune should surround us."" It may well be that God may soon send (you) success, or other command of His. Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts.",51,5,فَتَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِيهِمْ يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَىٰٓ أَن تُصِيبَنَا دَآئِرَةٌ فَعَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِٱلْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِۦ فَيُصْبِحُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَسَرُّوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ نَٰدِمِينَ,"You will see, O Messenger, those weak in faith rushing to become friends with the Jews and the Christians, saying, ‘We fear that these people will gain victory and when they come into power we will be harmed’. Perhaps Allah will give victory to the Messenger and the believers or bring something from Him that will crush the force of the Jews and their allies. Those who rush to befriend them will then regret the hypocrisy they kept hidden within their hearts, because the weak links they held on to will be for nothing."
"Then the believers will say: ""Are these the people who had sworn by God on solemn oath and said: ""We are surely with you?"" Wasted have been all their deeds, and losers they remain.",52,5,وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَهَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَقْسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ إِنَّهُمْ لَمَعَكُمْ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ خَٰسِرِينَ,"The believers will say in surprise at the condition of these hypocrites, ‘Are these the people who swore serious oaths that they were with you – O you who have faith – in faith, support and alliance?’ Their actions have gone to waste and they have become losers because they lost their true goal and because of the punishment prepared for them."
"O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer. Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing.",53,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَن يَرْتَدَّ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِۦ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى ٱللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُۥٓ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ يُجَٰهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لَآئِمٍ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, if anyone of you turns back from their religion to disbelief, then Allah will soon replace them with a people whom He will love and who will love Him due to their steadfastness. They will be compassionate towards the believers and harsh towards the disbelievers. They will strive with their wealth and their lives so that Allah’s word is victorious. They will not fear the one who blames them, because their concern will be Allah’s pleasure and blame rather than that of created things. That is Allah’s grace which He gives to whomever of His servants He wishes. Allah’s grace and kindness is wide and He knows who is deserving of the same and who is not."
"Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion, who pay the zakat and bow in homage (before God).",54,5,إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُمْ رَٰكِعُونَ,"The Jews, Christians and other disbelievers are not your friends. Your true friends and supporters are Allah, His Messenger and the believers who establish their prayers completely, give Zakat of their wealth and who are humble before Allah."
"And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious.",55,5,وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فَإِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ,"Whoever becomes the friend of Allah, His Messenger and the believers by supporting them, then they will be from Allah’s party and Allah’s party will be victorious since Allah is their supporter."
"O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;",56,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ دِينَكُمْ هُزُوًا وَلَعِبًا مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَٱلْكُفَّارَ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not become friends with those Jews and Christians who have received scripture, and those idolaters, all of whom poke fun at and play with your religion. Be mindful of Allah by avoiding becoming friends with those whom He has prohibited you from so doing, if you truly have faith in Him and in His revelation."
"(Nor make friends with) those who, when you call (the faithful) to prayer, make mock of it and jest, because they do not understand.",57,5,وَإِذَا نَادَيْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ ٱتَّخَذُوهَا هُزُوًا وَلَعِبًا ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَعْقِلُونَ,"They also poke fun and play when you call towards prayer, which is the greatest act of worship. That is because they are a nation who do not understand the meaning of worship of Allah and they do not understand the sacred laws that Allah has made."
"Say to them: ""O people of the Book, what reason have you for disliking us other than that we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?""",58,5,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ هَلْ تَنقِمُونَ مِنَّآ إِلَّآ أَنْ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to those of the People of the Scripture who mock at you: ‘Do you find any fault with us besides our faith in Allah and in what He revealed to us and what He revealed before us? And our belief that most of you do not follow Allah due to not having faith and not obeying His sacred law? What you consider a fault is actually a virtue’."
"Say: ""Shall I inform you who will receive the worst chastisement from God? They who were condemned by God, and on whom fell His wrath, and those who were turned to apes and swine, and those who worship the powers of evil. They are in the worse gradation, and farthest away from the right path.""",59,5,قُلْ هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذَٰلِكَ مَثُوبَةً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَن لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْقِرَدَةَ وَٱلْخَنَازِيرَ وَعَبَدَ ٱلطَّٰغُوتَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَانًا وَأَضَلُّ عَن سَوَآءِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"Say, O Messenger: Shall I tell you about those who are more at fault and whose punishment is worse than these people? They are their predecessors whom Allah has removed from His mercy, transformed into monkeys and pigs and made some of them worshippers of false gods. The Arabic word ţāghūt refers to any being that is worshipped besides Allah with its consent. Those mentioned will be in a worse position on the Day of Judgement and their efforts are further away from the straight path."
"When they come to you they say: ""We believe;"" but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go; and God is aware of what they conceal in their hearts.",60,5,وَإِذَا جَآءُوكُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَقَد دَّخَلُوا۟ بِٱلْكُفْرِ وَهُمْ قَدْ خَرَجُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْتُمُونَ,"When the hypocrites from amongst them come to you, O believers, on the outside they show that they have faith. The fact is that they were soaked in disbelief when they entered and when they left. Allah knows best about the disbelief they kept hidden, even though they gave the outer appearance of having faith. Allah will repay them for that."
"You will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness, and devour unlawful gain. How evil are the things they do!",61,5,وَتَرَىٰ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُمْ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَأَكْلِهِمُ ٱلسُّحْتَ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"You, O Messenger, see many of the Jews and hypocrites rushing towards committing sins, such as lying, oppression and consuming that which is unlawful. How evil is their behaviour!"
Why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain? Evil are the acts they commit!,62,5,لَوْلَا يَنْهَىٰهُمُ ٱلرَّبَّٰنِيُّونَ وَٱلْأَحْبَارُ عَن قَوْلِهِمُ ٱلْإِثْمَ وَأَكْلِهِمُ ٱلسُّحْتَ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَصْنَعُونَ,"Why do their leaders and scholars not prohibit them from the lying, false testimony and wrongful consumption of the wealth of people that they rush towards? This action of their leaders and scholars, who do not prohibit them from evil, is wrong."
"The Jews say: ""Bound are the hands of God."" Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say! In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt.",63,5,وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُوا۟ بِمَا قَالُوا۟ بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم مَّآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَٰنًا وَكُفْرًا وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ ٱلْعَدَٰوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ كُلَّمَآ أَوْقَدُوا۟ نَارًا لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا ٱللَّهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"When the Jews were faced with difficulty and drought, they said, ‘Allah’s Hand is restrained from giving goodness and gifts. He is holding back from us what He has’. Their hands were restrained from doing goodness and they were removed from Allah’s mercy because of this statement of theirs. But in fact Allah’s Hands are wide open in goodness and generosity. He spends as He wills. He gives and He withholds. No one can stop Him or force Him. That which has been revealed to you, O Messenger, only increases the Jews in disobedience and disbelief because of their envy. He placed enmity and hatred between the various groups of the Jews. Whenever they gather to conspire for war and made preparation for it, Allah broke their unity and took away their strength. They continuously strive to do that which causes corruption in the earth by their attempts to wipe out Islam and by their plots against it."
"If the people of the Book had believed and feared, We would surely have absolved them of their sins, and admitted them to gardens of delight.",64,5,وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱتَّقَوْا۟ لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ وَلَأَدْخَلْنَٰهُمْ جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"If the Jews and the Christians accepted what was brought by Muhammad (peace be upon him) and were mindful of Allah by leaving sins, I would have forgiven the sins they committed, even if they were many, and I would have entered them on the Day of Judgement into gardens of delight, in which they would enjoy delights that will never end."
"And if they had followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them by their Lord, they would surely have enjoyed (blessings) from the heavens above and the earth below their feet.",65,5,وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ أَقَامُوا۟ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ وَٱلْإِنجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِم مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ لَأَكَلُوا۟ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم مِّنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُّقْتَصِدَةٌ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ,"If the Jews had practiced what was in the Torah, and the Christians practiced what was in the Gospel, and if all of them had practiced what was revealed to them in the Qur’ān, then I would have made the means of provision easy for them by sending down rain and growing vegetation. From amongst the People of the Scripture are those who are moderate and firm on the truth; but the actions of many of them are evil, because they do not have faith in what was brought by Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
"Some among them are moderate, but evil is what most of them do! O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message. God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe.",66,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"O Messenger, communicate what has been revealed to you from your Lord completely and do not hide anything of it. If you do hide anything, then you are not one who conveys the message of His Lord. The Prophet (peace be upon him) communicated everything he was instructed to. Anyone who claims anything to the contrary has spoken a great lie about Allah. Allah will protect you from people and they will not be able to harm you. Your duty is only to communicate the divine message. Allah will not bless with guidance those who disbelieve and who have no desire to be guided."
"Say to them: ""O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord."" But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe.",67,5,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَسْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ حَتَّىٰ تُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ وَٱلْإِنجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم مَّآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَٰنًا وَكُفْرًا فَلَا تَأْسَ عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Say, O Messenger: You – Jews and Christians – have no religious basis, unless you practice what is in the Torah and the Gospel and practice the Qur’ān that has been revealed to you. Your faith is not valid until you have faith in it and practice it. That which has been revealed to you from your Lord will increase the disobedience and disbelief of many of the People of the Scripture because of their envy. So do not be sad over these disbelievers: In the believers who follow you there is sufficient goodness."
"All those who believe, and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, in fact any one who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, will have nothing to fear or regret.",68,5,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلصَّٰبِـُٔونَ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"The believers in Muhammad, and the Jews, Sabians and Christians before Muhammad – whichever of them believes Allah and the Last Day and does good actions – they will have no fear for the future and will not be sad over that which they missed in the worldly life."
"We had taken a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers to them; but whenever an apostle came to them bringing what did not suit their mood, they called one imposter, another they slew,",69,5,لَقَدْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَٰقَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ رُسُلًا كُلَّمَا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌۢ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰٓ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَرِيقًا كَذَّبُوا۟ وَفَرِيقًا يَقْتُلُونَ,I took firm promises from the Israelites that they will listen and follow. But they broke their promises and followed their desires by ignoring what their messengers brought and by disbelieving some and murdering others.
And imagined that no trials would befall them; and they turned deaf and blind (to the truth). But God still turned to them; yet many of them turned blind and deaf again; but God sees everything they do.,70,5,وَحَسِبُوٓا۟ أَلَّا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ فَعَمُوا۟ وَصَمُّوا۟ ثُمَّ تَابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ عَمُوا۟ وَصَمُّوا۟ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,They thought that no harm would come to them for their breaking promises and covenants and for disbelieving and killing their prophets. But the result of their actions was that they became blind and deaf to the truth and misled from guidance. Then Allah turned towards them out of His grace. They again then became blind and deaf to the truth. This happened to many of them. Allah sees what they do. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will repay them for their actions.
"They are surely infidels who say: ""God is the Christ, son of Mary."" But the Christ had only said: ""O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord."" Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them.",71,5,لَقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَقَالَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَىٰهُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ,"The Christians who say that ‘Allah is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary’ have committed disbelief, as they have attributed Lordship to someone other than Allah. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, himself said to them, ‘O Israelites, worship Allah alone. He is my Lord and your Lord. We are all His servants’. Whoever ascribes anything as a partner to Allah, then Allah will not allow them to ever enter Paradise and their place will be the fire of Hell. They will have no one to help or assist them before Allah and no one to save them from the punishment that awaits them."
"Disbelievers are they surely who say: ""God is the third of the trinity;"" but there is no god other than God the one. And if they do not desist from saying what they say, then indeed those among them who persist in disbelief will suffer painful punishment.",72,5,لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَٰثَةٍ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّآ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُوا۟ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"The Christians who say that ‘Allah is part of the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit’ have committed disbelief. Allah is far above such a statement. Allah is not many, but He is only One God Who has no partner. If they do not stop saying such things, a painful punishment will afflict them."
Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness? God is forgiving and kind.,73,5,أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Will these people not retract this statement, repent to Allah and ask His forgiveness for the idolatry they committed? Allah is Forgiving towards the one who repents, whatever may have been the sin, even if it was disbelief. Allah is Compassionate to the believers."
"The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle, and many apostles had (come and) gone before him; and his mother was a woman of truth. They both ate the (same) food (as men). Behold, how We show men clear signs, and behold, how they wander astray!",74,5,مَّا ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ ٱلرُّسُلُ وَأُمُّهُۥ صِدِّيقَةٌ كَانَا يَأْكُلَانِ ٱلطَّعَامَ ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ ثُمَّ ٱنظُرْ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger like other messengers. Just as death occurs to other messengers, it will occur to him as well. His mother, Mary, was a truthful and sincere woman. Both of them were in need of and used to consume food. How can they be gods when they were in need of food? Look, O Messenger, and think about how I make clear to them the signs indicating My Oneness and the falsehood of their extremism in attributing Lordship to others besides Me. Despite this, they do not recognise these signs. Then look and think about how they are misled from the truth, despite these clear signs indicating My Oneness."
"Tell them: ""Leaving God aside, will you worship something that has no power over your loss or gain?"" But God is all-hearing and all-knowing.",75,5,قُلْ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا وَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Say, O Messenger, as an argument against their worship of others besides Allah: Do you worship that which can bring you no benefit and which cannot protect you from any harm? Such a god is in reality very weak! Whilst Allah is High above any state of weakness. Allah alone is the One Who hears your statements and knows your actions. Nothing remains hidden from Him and He will repay you accordingly."
"Tell them: ""O people of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs, and follow not the wishes of a people who had erred before, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the right path.""",76,5,قُلْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَا تَغْلُوا۟ فِى دِينِكُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوٓا۟ أَهْوَآءَ قَوْمٍ قَدْ ضَلُّوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّوا۟ كَثِيرًا وَضَلُّوا۟ عَن سَوَآءِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"Say, O Messenger, to the Christians: Do not overstep the boundaries of the instruction you were given to follow the truth. Do not be excessive in reverence of those whom you were instructed to revere, such as prophets, regarding them to be divine as you have done with respect to Jesus, son of Mary. You did this because of following your predecessors who were astray, who led many other people astray and who were far from the path of truth."
"Cursed were disbelievers among the children of Israel by David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they rebelled and transgressed the bounds.",77,5,لُعِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنۢ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ عَلَىٰ لِسَانِ دَاوُۥدَ وَعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا۟ وَّكَانُوا۟ يَعْتَدُونَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, tells us that He distanced the disbelievers of the Israelites from His mercy in the scripture He revealed to David, namely the Psalms, and in the scripture He revealed to Jesus, son of Mary, namely the Gospel. He did this because of the sins they committed and due to their violation of the things Allah made sacred."
They did not restrain one another from the wicked things they used to do; and vile were the things that they were doing!,78,5,كَانُوا۟ لَا يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍ فَعَلُوهُ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْعَلُونَ,"They did not forbid the sinner from amongst them from committing sin. Instead, the sinners used to commit sins and evil openly because no one would disapprove of it. How evil was the action of not forbidding the evil that they used to do!"
"You can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels. Vile it was what they sent ahead of them, so that God's indignation came upon them; and torment will they suffer an eternity.",79,5,تَرَىٰ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُمْ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَبِئْسَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ لَهُمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ أَن سَخِطَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَفِى ٱلْعَذَابِ هُمْ خَٰلِدُونَ,"You will see, O Messenger, many of the disbelieving Jews forming alliances with the idolators and opposing you and those who believe in Allah’s oneness. How evil is their action of taking disbelievers as allies! This will cause Allah’s anger and lead them into the Fire, where they will live eternally, never to leave."
"If they had believed in God and the Prophet and what had been revealed to him, they would never have held them as allies; and many among them are transgressors.",80,5,وَلَوْ كَانُوا۟ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلنَّبِىِّ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَا ٱتَّخَذُوهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَلَٰكِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"If these Jews had true faith in Allah and His Prophet, they would not have taken the idolaters as their allies instead of the believers, because they were prohibited from taking disbelievers as friends. But most of these Jews do not obey Allah nor do they side with Him and the believers."
"You will find the Jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe; and the closest in love to the faithful are the people who say: ""We are the followers of Christ,"" because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant.",81,5,لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ ٱلنَّاسِ عَدَٰوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُم مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا نَصَٰرَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا وَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"You will find, O Messenger, that the people with the most hostility towards those who have faith in you and that which you brought are the Jews, due to their malice, jealousy and pride, as well as the idol worshippers and others who associate partners with Allah. You will also find that the people who are closest in affection to those who have faith in you and that which you brought are those who call themselves Christians. The verse explains that the reason for these people being close to the believers is that there are scholars, ascetics and worshippers among them who are humble and not proud. Good does not enter the heart of a proud person."
"For when they listen to what has been revealed to this Apostle, you can see their eyes brim over with tears at the truth which they recognise, and say: ""O Lord, we believe; put us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).",82,5,وَإِذَا سَمِعُوا۟ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ تَرَىٰٓ أَعْيُنَهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ ٱلدَّمْعِ مِمَّا عَرَفُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَٱكْتُبْنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"The hearts of these Christians are soft. When they listen to any part of the Qur’ān that has been revealed, they cry in submission, because they recognise that it is the truth because of their knowing that which Jesus (peace be with him) brought. They say: Our Lord, we accept what You have revealed to Your Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him). So record us, Our Lord, among those of the nation who will be witnesses against people on the Day of Rising."
"And why should we not believe in God and what has come down to us of the truth? And we hope to be admitted by our Lord among those who are upright and do good?""",83,5,وَمَا لَنَا لَا نُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَنَطْمَعُ أَن يُدْخِلَنَا رَبُّنَا مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,What prevents us from having faith in Allah and the truth that He has revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him)? We hope that we will enter Paradise together with the prophets and their followers who obeyed Allah and feared His punishment.
"God will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by, where they will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who do good.",84,5,فَأَثَٰبَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا قَالُوا۟ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Allah rewarded them for their faith and their acceptance of the truth with gardens that have palaces and trees overlooking flowing streams, where they will live eternally. That is the reward of those who do good by following the truth and submitting to it, without any restriction or condition."
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are residents of Hell.,85,5,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and reject the verses Allah revealed to His Messenger, they are the companions of the Fire, which they will enter and never leave."
"O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress. God does not love transgressors.",86,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُحَرِّمُوا۟ طَيِّبَٰتِ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not regard as unlawful the good food, drink and women that Allah has made lawful for you. Do not treat these things as unlawful in an attempt to practise asceticism and devotion. Do not overstep the limits of that which Allah has forbidden to you, because Allah does not love those who overstep His limits; rather, He hates them."
"Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe.",87,5,وَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَٰلًا طَيِّبًا وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنتُم بِهِۦ مُؤْمِنُونَ,"Consume the lawful and pure things that Allah gives to you from His provision. But do not consume the unlawful, such as something that is taken wrongfully or is impure. Be mindful of Allah by obeying His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, because He is the one you have faith in and it requires you to be mindful of Him."
"God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths. Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful.",88,5,لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغْوِ فِىٓ أَيْمَٰنِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ ٱلْأَيْمَٰنَ فَكَفَّٰرَتُهُۥٓ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَٰكِينَ مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَٰثَةِ أَيَّامٍ ذَٰلِكَ كَفَّٰرَةُ أَيْمَٰنِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ وَٱحْفَظُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَكُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah will not take you to account, O believers, for the oaths that you speak unintentionally. He will take you to account for those oaths that you break after making them with a firm intention in your hearts. The atonement for such oaths is one of three options: feeding ten poor people with the average food of your city, by giving each poor person half a ṣā‘ of food; or clothing them with what society considers to be a suit of clothing; or freeing a believing slave. If the person required to make atonement does not find any of these three things, then the required atonement is fasting for three days. That is the atonement of your oaths, O believers, when you break them. Guard your oaths from being taken falsely in Allah’s name and from breaking them, unless it is better to do so. If it is better to break your oath, then do so and give the atonement. Just as Allah has explained to you the atonement for oaths, He also explains to you His laws, which make clear what is lawful and what is unlawful, so that you might thank Allah for having taught you what you did not know."
"O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.",89,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا ٱلْخَمْرُ وَٱلْمَيْسِرُ وَٱلْأَنصَابُ وَٱلْأَزْلَٰمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ فَٱجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, intoxicants that affect the mind, gambling with a consideration from both sides, stone alters on which the idolaters offer sacrifices or which they erect for worship, and arrows by which they used to draw lots – these are all acts of sin that Satan has made attractive. Avoid such acts, so that you successfully achieve the Paradise that you desire and are saved from the Fire that you fear."
"Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?",90,5,إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ ٱلْعَدَٰوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ فِى ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَنِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّنتَهُونَ,"By making alcohol and gambling seem attractive, Satan’s only intention is to create hatred between hearts and to turn them away from Allah’s remembrance and from the prayer. Will you, O believers, leave these evil acts? Without doubt, leaving these acts is the right thing to do, so avoid them."
"Obey God and the Prophet, and beware. If you turn away, remember, that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning.",91,5,وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَٱحْذَرُوا۟ فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"Follow God and follow the Messenger by fulfilling the instructions of the Sacred Law and avoiding its prohibitions. Be careful of breaking the law. If you turn away from this, know that the duty of Messenger is only to convey to you what God has instructed him to, and He has already done so. If you come on to the right path it is for your own good. If you do wrong it will be to your detriment."
"Those who believe and perform good deeds will not be held guilty for what they have eaten (in the past) if they fear God and believe, and do good things and are conscious (of God) and believe, and still fear and do good, for God loves those who do good.",92,5,لَيْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُوٓا۟ إِذَا مَا ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ ثُمَّ ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّءَامَنُوا۟ ثُمَّ ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّأَحْسَنُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"There is no sin on those who have faith in Allah, and do good actions to gain closeness to Him, for drinking alcohol before it was made unlawful, as long as they now stay away from it, being mindful of Allah’s anger, having faith in Him and doing good actions, and then increase in their awareness of Allah until they worship Him as if they see Him. Allah loves those who worship Him as if they see Him, because they are aware that Allah is always watching them. This leads believers to improve their actions."
"O you who believe, God will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances, in order to know who fear Him unseen. Whosoever transgress after this will suffer grievous punishment.",93,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِشَىْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلصَّيْدِ تَنَالُهُۥٓ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَرِمَاحُكُمْ لِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَخَافُهُۥ بِٱلْغَيْبِ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُۥ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, Allah will certainly test you by giving you land game when you are in the state of Ihram. You will be able to hold the smaller game with your hands and the bigger ones with your spears. Allah will do this to show who fears his Creator, without having seen Him. Reward and punishment in the Afterlife will be based on people’s actions. Nothing is hidden from Allah. Whoever oversteps the limits, and hunts in the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah, he shall receive a painful punishment on the Day of Rising because of violating Allah’s prohibition."
"O you who believe, do not kill game when you are on pilgrimage. And anyone among you who does so on purpose should offer livestock of equivalent value, determined by two honourable persons among you, (as atonement), to be brought to the Ka'bah as an offering; or else expiate by giving food to the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may realise the gravity of his deed. God has forgiven what has happened in the past; but any one who does so again will be punished by God. And God is severe in requital.",94,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَقْتُلُوا۟ ٱلصَّيْدَ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ وَمَن قَتَلَهُۥ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَآءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ ٱلنَّعَمِ يَحْكُمُ بِهِۦ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ هَدْيًۢا بَٰلِغَ ٱلْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّٰرَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَٰكِينَ أَوْ عَدْلُ ذَٰلِكَ صِيَامًا لِّيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِۦ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَفَ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنْهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنتِقَامٍ,"O you who accept God and practise on His laws, do not kill land game when you are in the state of pilgrim sanctity for Hajj or Umra. Whoever of you does so deliberately shall be liable for a punishment equivalent to the game they killed from camels, cattle or sheep. This will be judged by two men who are known to be upright amongst the Muslims. The animal that they decide shall be treated as an offering is treated, and shall be sent to Makkah to be slaughtered in the Sanctuary. Another option for the atonement is that the equivalent value should be distributed to the poor within the Sanctuary, every poor person should receive half a sa` of grain, or the fast of one day should be kept for every half sa` of grain. God has overlooked the game of the Sanctuary which were killed in the past, and the person who hunted land game in the state of pilgrim sanctity prior to the prohibition. If anyone repeats this, after the prohibition, then God will take retribution from them by punishing them for the same. God is Mighty and Powerful. He has the ability to take retribution on the one who goes against Him if He wishes. Nothing can stop Him from doing so."
"Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage. Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end.",95,5,أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَحْرِ وَطَعَامُهُۥ مَتَٰعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِلسَّيَّارَةِ وَحُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَرِّ مَا دُمْتُمْ حُرُمًا وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِىٓ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"Allah has permitted you to catch aquatic animals and what the sea throws out, dead or alive, as a benefit for a resident or to nourish a traveller. He has prohibited hunting land game as long as you are in the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah. Be mindful of Allah by carrying out His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. You will return to Him on the Day of Rising; and He will repay your actions."
"God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything.",96,5,جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكَعْبَةَ ٱلْبَيْتَ ٱلْحَرَامَ قِيَٰمًا لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱلشَّهْرَ ٱلْحَرَامَ وَٱلْهَدْىَ وَٱلْقَلَٰٓئِدَ ذَٰلِكَ لِتَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sanctified House, an establishment for people, which secures their religious interests (such as prayer, Hajj and Umrah) and their worldly interests (such as security in the Sanctuary and the import of different fruits). He has also made the sacred months (Dhū Al-Qa‘dah, Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram and Rajab) an establishment for people in that they are secure in these months from anyone fighting against them. Then He has made the sacrificial animals, and the garlands that indicate that they are being driven to the Sanctuary, an establishment for people in that their owners are secure from anyone harming them. All of this is Allah’s favour to you, so that you are aware that Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth. His creation of such laws – that secure your interests and protect you from harm – is proof that He knows what is best for His servants."
"Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind.",97,5,ٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Know, O people, that Allah’s punishment for those who go against Him is severe; and that He is Forgiving and Compassionate towards those who repent to Him."
It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide.,98,5,مَّا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,"The duty of the Messenger is only to convey what Allah has instructed him to. It is not his duty to make people accept the guidance: that is only in Allah’s Hands. Allah knows what you reveal and what you keep hidden, whether guidance or misguidance, and He will repay your actions."
"Tell them: ""The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you."" So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success.",99,5,قُل لَّا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْخَبِيثُ وَٱلطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ ٱلْخَبِيثِ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَٰٓأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: Bad is not the same as good, even if the bad is a large amount that impresses you. A large amount of something does not mean that it is best. Be mindful of Allah, O people of intellect, by leaving the bad and doing the good, so that you successfully achieve Paradise and are saved from the fire of Hell."
"O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing.",100,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَسْـَٔلُوا۟ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ وَإِن تَسْـَٔلُوا۟ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهَا وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah, follow His Messenger and practise His laws, do not ask your Messenger about things which you do not in need, and which will not be of any help to you in your religion. If you were told of such things, they would upset you because of the difficulty in them. If, despite the prohibition, you ask about these things, then know that revelation is coming down to the Prophet and they will be made clear to you. That is easy for Allah. Allah has not said certain things in the Qur’ān, so do not ask about them. If you ask about them, you will have to follow the law that is then revealed."
"Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards.",101,5,قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُوا۟ بِهَا كَٰفِرِينَ,"A nation before you had asked about things not initially revealed to them. When they were then commanded to do them, they did not carry out the order; and became disbelievers as a result."
"God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense.",102,5,مَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنۢ بَحِيرَةٍ وَلَا سَآئِبَةٍ وَلَا وَصِيلَةٍ وَلَا حَامٍ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah has made livestock lawful for you to consume. He has not made unlawful what the idolaters declared unlawful for themselves when dedicating them to their idols, such as: baḥīrah, a she-camel whose ear is cut after it gives birth to a certain number; or sā’ibah, a she-camel that is left for the idols after it reaches a certain age; or waṣīlah, a she-camel that gives birth to one female after another; or ḥāmī, a male camel stud that mates with other camels and produces a given number of offspring. Allah did not make any of these; but the disbelievers falsely claimed that Allah had forbidden these things. Most of the disbelievers do not differentiate between truth and falsehood and between the lawful and the unlawful."
"When you say to them: ""Come to what God has revealed, and the Prophet,"" they say: ""Sufficient to us is the faith that our fathers had followed,"" even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance.",103,5,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ قَالُوا۟ حَسْبُنَا مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ,"When it is said to these people who make up lies about Allah, with respect to forbidding certain livestock: Come towards the Qur’ān that Allah revealed and to the path of the Messenger (peace be upon him), so that you can learn the lawful and the unlawful – they say: The beliefs, statements and actions we have taken and inherited from our predecessors is enough for us. How could this be enough for them when their predecessors did not know anything and were not guided to the truth? Only the person who is more ignorant and misguided than them follows them."
"O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves. If you follow the right path those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm. To God have all of you to return, when He will tell you what you were doing.",104,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ لَا يَضُرُّكُم مَّن ضَلَّ إِذَا ٱهْتَدَيْتُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"O you who faith in Allah, follow His Messenger and practise His laws, you are only responsible for your own souls, so only do that which benefits them. Those people who are misguided, and who do not respond to you, will not harm you if you are on the right path. Being on the right path includes encouraging good and forbidding evil. On the Day of Rising, all of you will return to Allah only and He will tell you about what you used to do in the world and repay your actions."
"O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: ""We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful.""",105,5,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ شَهَٰدَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ حِينَ ٱلْوَصِيَّةِ ٱثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ أَوْ ءَاخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَصَٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ لَا نَشْتَرِى بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَٰدَةَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلْءَاثِمِينَ,"O you who faith in Allah, follow His Messenger and practise His laws, when death approaches any of you, with the appearance its signs, then call to witness the bequest two upright Muslim men, or two men from the disbelievers (if the need arises due to there being no Muslims; for example, if you are travelling at that time). If there is any doubt regarding their testimony, keep them back after one of the prayers and let them both take an oath in Allah’s name saying, ‘We will not sell our share from Allah for any amount, such as by preferring a relative. Also, we will not conceal any testimony for Allah that is with us’. Tell them that if they are not truthful, they will be sinners who go against Allah."
"If it transpires they have concealed the truth, two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and swear by God: ""Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have stated no more (than the truth), or else we shall be unjust""",106,5,فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَىٰٓ أَنَّهُمَا ٱسْتَحَقَّآ إِثْمًا فَـَٔاخَرَانِ يَقُومَانِ مَقَامَهُمَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْأَوْلَيَٰنِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ لَشَهَٰدَتُنَآ أَحَقُّ مِن شَهَٰدَتِهِمَا وَمَا ٱعْتَدَيْنَآ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"If, after the oath is taken, it is established that the witnesses lied in their testimony or in the oath, then let two others who are closest to the deceased take an oath on the truth in their place. These new witnesses should take an oath by Allah saying, ‘Our testimony about their lying and deceit is closer to the truth than their testimony about their honesty and trustworthiness. We have not taken a false oath. If we do so, we will be from the wrongdoers who overstep Allah’s limits’."
"It is thus likely that men will bear witness rightly, or else fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths given after them. So fear God, and do not forget that God does not guide the iniquitous.",107,5,ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَن يَأْتُوا۟ بِٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهَآ أَوْ يَخَافُوٓا۟ أَن تُرَدَّ أَيْمَٰنٌۢ بَعْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْمَعُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"These various oaths to be taken by the witnesses after the prayer (when you doubt their testimony) and the rejection of their testimony increases the likelihood that they will testify in the way required by the sacred law, without them distorting the facts deceitfully. Witnesses are more likely to give true testimony for fear that they will be disgraced if the heirs give conflicting testimony. Be mindful of Allah by not lying or being deceitful in your testimony and oath. Listen to what you are instructed to do and obey. Allah does not guide those who go against Him."
"The day God will gather the apostles and ask: ""What answer was made to you?"" They will say: ""We know not. You alone know the secrets unknown.""",108,5,يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أُجِبْتُمْ قَالُوا۟ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّٰمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,"Remember, O people, the Day of Rising when Allah will gather all the messengers and ask them how their communities had responded to them? They will assign the answer to that question to Allah and say, ‘I have no knowledge. You have all knowledge, our Lord. You are the only one Who knows all things that are present or absent’."
"And when God will say: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favours I bestowed on you and your mother, and reinforced you with divine grace that you spoke to men when in the cradle, and when in the prime of life; when I taught you the law and the judgement and the Torah and the Gospel; when you formed the state of your people's destiny out of mire and you breathed (a new spirit) into it, and they rose by My leave; when you healed the blind by My leave, and the leper; when you put life into the dead by My will; and when I held back the children of Israel from you when you brought to them My signs, and the disbelievers among them said: ""Surely these are nothing but pure magic.""",109,5,إِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱذْكُرْ نِعْمَتِى عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَتِكَ إِذْ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ تُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِى ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلًا وَإِذْ عَلَّمْتُكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ وَٱلْإِنجِيلَ وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْـَٔةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِى فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيْرًۢا بِإِذْنِى وَتُبْرِئُ ٱلْأَكْمَهَ وَٱلْأَبْرَصَ بِإِذْنِى وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِى وَإِذْ كَفَفْتُ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ عَنكَ إِذْ جِئْتَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Remember when Allah addressed Jesus (peace be upon him) and told him to remember Allah’s favour to him when He created him without a father; to his mother, Mary (peace be upon her), when He chose her over all the women of her time; and upon him when He strengthened him with Gabriel (peace be upon him.). Allah told him that he used to speak to people as a baby, calling them to Allah; and that he used to speak to them in his adulthood, telling them what Allah had sent him with. Allah reminded him of the favour of being taught how to write; and that He taught him the Torah that He had revealed to Moses (peace be upon him) and the Gospel that He revealed to him. He was reminded of the favour of being taught the secrets of the sacred law and its benefits and wisdom. Allah reminded him of how he would make the shape of a bird from clay, blow into it and it used to become a living bird. He used to cure the person who was born blind, and he would treat the leper and heal his skin. He also used to bring the dead to life by praying to Allah to give them life. All of this happened with Allah’s permission. Another favour that Allah reminded him about was that Allah protected him from the Israelites when they intended to kill him after he brought to them clear miracles. The only thing they could do was to deny them; and they said, ‘Jesus has brought nothing but plain sorcery’."
"And when I inspired the disciples (through Jesus) to believe in Me and My apostle, they said: ""We believe, and You bear witness that we submit""",110,5,وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى ٱلْحَوَارِيِّۦنَ أَنْ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِى وَبِرَسُولِى قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ,"Another favour that Allah reminded him about was that Allah created assistants for him when He inspired the disciples to have faith in Him and in Jesus. They submitted to that and responded saying, ‘I believe. Be a witness, O our Lord, that we submit to You in devotion’."
"When the disciples said: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, could your Lord send down for us a table laid with food?"" he said: ""Fear God, if indeed you believe.""",111,5,إِذْ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَن يُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا مَآئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ قَالَ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Remember when the disciples said, ‘Can you call on your Lord to send down a table from the sky?’ Jesus (peace be upon him) responded to them by telling them to be mindful of Allah and not to ask for such a thing, as it may prove to be a trial for them. He said to them, ‘Place your trust in your Lord in seeking provision, if you are truly believers’."
"They said: ""We should like to eat of it to reassure our hearts and to know that it's the truth you have told us, and that we should be witness to it.""",112,5,قَالُوا۟ نُرِيدُ أَن نَّأْكُلَ مِنْهَا وَتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُنَا وَنَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ صَدَقْتَنَا وَنَكُونَ عَلَيْهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"The disciples said to Jesus, ‘We want to eat from this table, so that our hearts are satisfied about Allah’s perfect power and that you are His Messenger: to know for certain that you have told us the truth about what you have brought from Allah and to be witnesses to it for those people who are not present’."
"Said Jesus, son of Mary. ""O God, our Lord, send down a table well laid out with food from the skies so that this day may be a day of feast for the earlier among us and the later, and a token from You. Give us our (daily) bread, for You are the best of all givers of food.""",113,5,قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ ٱللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَآ أَنزِلْ عَلَيْنَا مَآئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ تَكُونُ لَنَا عِيدًا لِّأَوَّلِنَا وَءَاخِرِنَا وَءَايَةً مِّنكَ وَٱرْزُقْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"Jesus gave in to their request and prayed to Allah saying, ‘Our Lord, send down to us a table of food, so that we can hold a festival on the day it comes down in order to honour You out of gratitude. It will also be a sign and proof of Your Oneness and of the truth of what I have been sent with. Give us such provision that will help us worship You. You, O our Lord, are the best provider’."
"And said God: ""I shall send it down to you; but if any of you disbelieve after this, I shall inflict such punishment on him as I never shall inflict on any other creature.""",114,5,قَالَ ٱللَّهُ إِنِّى مُنَزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بَعْدُ مِنكُمْ فَإِنِّىٓ أُعَذِّبُهُۥ عَذَابًا لَّآ أُعَذِّبُهُۥٓ أَحَدًا مِّنَ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Allah answered the prayer of Jesus (peace be upon him) and said that He would send down the table that they had requested. He also told him that if anyone disbelieves after the table is sent down then they should blame only themselves, and that Allah will punish them with a severe punishment, unlike any other: due to them seeing an overwhelming proof and any denial being the result of stubbornness. Allah fulfilled His promise and sent down the table to them."
"And when God will ask: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?' (Jesus) will answer: ""Halleluja. Could I say what I knew I had no right (to say)? Had I said it You would surely have known, for You know what is in my heart though I know not what You have. You alone know the secrets unknown.",115,5,وَإِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ءَأَنتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ ٱتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَٰهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَٰنَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِىٓ أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِحَقٍّ إِن كُنتُ قُلْتُهُۥ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُۥ تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى وَلَآ أَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِكَ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّٰمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,"Remember that Allah will address Jesus son of Mary (peace be with him) on the Day of Rising and ask him whether he told people to worship him and his mother besides Allah. Jesus will reply, declaring Allah’s purity, ‘It was not right for me to tell them anything but the truth. If I had said that You would know it, because nothing is hidden from You. You know what I keep hidden within myself, but I do not know what is with You. You are the only one who knows everything that is hidden and everything that is apparent’."
"I said nought to them but what You commanded me: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And so long as I dwelt with them I was witness over their actions. And after my life had been done, You were their keeper; and You are a witness over all things.",116,5,مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَآ أَمَرْتَنِى بِهِۦٓ أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبَّكُمْ وَكُنتُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا مَّا دُمْتُ فِيهِمْ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيْتَنِى كُنتَ أَنتَ ٱلرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنتَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,"Jesus will say to His Lord, ‘I only told people what you instructed me to tell them: to worship You alone. For as long as I remained amongst them I watched over what they were saying. When my term ended and I was raised to the sky alive, You, O Lord, were watching their actions. You are a witness to everything and nothing is hidden from You; so You know what I said to them and what they said after me’."
"If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise.""",117,5,إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"If you punish them, O Lord, they are your servants and You can do with them as You wish. If You graciously forgive those of them who had faith, nothing can stop You from doing so because You are the Mighty, Who cannot be overpowered, and the Wise in Your handling of matters."
"God will say: 'This is the day when the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them will be gardens with streams running by, where they will for ever abide."" God will accept them, and they will be gratified in (obeying) Him. This will surely be happiness supreme.",118,5,قَالَ ٱللَّهُ هَٰذَا يَوْمُ يَنفَعُ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا رَّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Allah will say to Jesus (peace be with him) that the Day of Rising is a day on which the truthfulness of those who were true in their intentions, statements and actions will be of benefit to them. They will receive gardens with palaces and trees overlooking flowing streams, in which they will live eternally, with death never coming to them. Allah will be pleased with them and will never become angry with them. They will pleased with Allah because of the everlasting delight they have received. Such reward and pleasure is the supreme success, which cannot be equalled by any other."
"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and His the power over everything.",119,5,لِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا فِيهِنَّ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌۢ,"Allah alone controls the heavens and the earth, and everything within them. He is their Creator and the One Who handles their affairs. He has power over everything and nothing can overpower Him."
"ALL PRAISE BE to God who created the heavens and the earth, and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their Lord.",0,6,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ وَٱلنُّورَ ثُمَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ,"Only Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth from nothing, is described with perfection and praised with the noblest of qualities, and love is only due to Him. He created the night and the day, which follow one another. He created the night for darkness and the day for light. Despite all this, some of His servants disbelieve Him and associate partners with Him. Allah is far above what they say."
"It is He who created you from clay then determined a term (of life) for you, and a term (is fixed) with Him. Even then you doubt.",1,6,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُم مِّن طِينٍ ثُمَّ قَضَىٰٓ أَجَلًا وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى عِندَهُۥ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تَمْتَرُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who created you, O people, from clay when He created your father, Adam (peace be upon him) from it. Then He, may He be glorified, fixed a period for your stay in the life of the world. He also fixed another term, which only He knows, when He will raise you back to life on the Day of Rising. Despite this, you still doubt about His ability to raise you back to life."
"He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you hide and bring out into the open, and knows what you earn (of good and evil).",2,6,وَهُوَ ٱللَّهُ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَفِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One worthy of worship in the heavens and the earth. He knows the intentions, statements and actions you keep hidden and those you make public; and He will judge you about them."
Yet no sign of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it.,3,6,وَمَا تَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ مِّنْ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ,"No proof or miracle from their Lord comes to the idolaters except that they ignore it without paying any attention. Clear evidences and proof of the Oneness of Allah, as well as miracles proving the truthfulness of the messengers, have now come to them; yet despite this, they turned away and paid no attention to these signs and miracles."
So they disbelieved the truth when it came to them; but they will soon come to know the reality of what they had ridiculed.,4,6,فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِيهِمْ أَنۢبَٰٓؤُا۟ مَا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"While they have turned away from these clear evidences and proofs, they had previously turned away from something even clearer: they denied the Qur’ān that Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought. They will soon realise, when they see the punishment on the Day of Rising, that what they used to mock and what he brought to them was in fact the truth."
"Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them?",5,6,أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ مَّكَّنَّٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَا لَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّكُمْ وَأَرْسَلْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْهِم مِّدْرَارًا وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرَ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمْ فَأَهْلَكْنَٰهُم بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَأَنشَأْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْنًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"Do these disbelievers not know Allah’s custom of destroying communities who do wrong? Allah had destroyed, prior to them, many communities whom He had established in the earth with more stability than them. Allah sent down successive rains upon them and made rivers flow beneath their homes; yet they then went against Him, so He destroyed them because of the sins they committed. Then, after them, He established other communities."
"Even if We had sent you a transcript on paper which they could feel with their hands, the unbelievers would have said: ""This is nothing but clear sorcery.""",6,6,وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَٰبًا فِى قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"If we had sent down to you, O Messenger, a book written on paper and they had seen it with their eyes, they would not have accepted it out of stubbornness and denial; and they would have said, ‘What you have brought is nothing more than clear magic; and we will never believe in it’."
"They say: ""How is it no angel was sent down to him?"" Had We sent an angel down the matter would have come to end, and they would have had no respite.",7,6,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ وَلَوْ أَنزَلْنَا مَلَكًا لَّقُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ ثُمَّ لَا يُنظَرُونَ,"These disbelievers said, ‘We will believe if Allah sends down an angel with Muhammad (peace be upon him) who speaks to us and bears witness that he is a messenger’. If we send down an angel of the kind they wish, we will destroy them if they do not believe; and they will not be given time to repent."
"Even if We had sent down an angel as messenger he would have appeared in the garb of a man and filled them with confusion, like the one they are filled with.",8,6,وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَٰهُ مَلَكًا لَّجَعَلْنَٰهُ رَجُلًا وَلَلَبَسْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّا يَلْبِسُونَ,"If I had sent an angel to them, I would have made him in the form of a man, so that they could listen and learn from him, as they would not be able to learn from an angel in the original form that I created him. If I had made him in the form of a man, they would have been confused about him."
Surely the apostles have been mocked before you; but what they had mocked rebounded on the mockers themselves.,9,6,وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُوا۟ مِنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"If these people poke fun at you by asking for an angel to be sent down with you, then communities in the past also poked fun at their messengers. Then the punishment, which they used to deny and mock when they were warned about it, surrounded them."
"Say: ""Travel in the land and see what happened to those who disbelieved.""",10,6,قُلْ سِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ ٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these people who deny and mock you: Travel on earth and then think about what happened to those who disbelieved in Allah’s messengers. Allah’s punishment fell upon them after they were in a position of strength and power."
"And ask: ""To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say: ""To God."" He has prescribed grace for Himself. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come. Only they who are lost of soul will not come to believe.",11,6,قُل لِّمَن مَّا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ قُل لِّلَّهِ كَتَبَ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Say to them, O Messenger, ‘To whom does dominion of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, belong?’ Say: Their total control belongs to Allah. He has established mercy upon Himself out of grace for His servants, and will therefore not rush to punish them. If they do not repent, He will gather them together on the Day of Rising, a day about which there is no doubt. Those who have lost their souls by bringing them to the point of destruction, due to their disbelief in Allah, will not believe and rescue their souls from loss."
Whatsoever dwells in the night and day belongs to Him. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.,12,6,وَلَهُۥ مَا سَكَنَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"To Allah alone belongs dominion of everything. Whatever rests hidden in the night and whatever moves about openly in the day are all His servants and His creation: they are all under His domination and control. He hears their statements and knows their actions, and will judge by them."
"Say: ""Should I find some other protector besides God the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who nourishes all and is nourished by none? Say: ""I am commanded to be the first to submit to Him, and not be an idolater.""",13,6,قُلْ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَتَّخِذُ وَلِيًّا فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ قُلْ إِنِّىٓ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters who worship idols and other things together with Allah: Does it make sense that I take any one other than Allah as a guardian and a protector from whom I seek help? Allah is the One Who created the heavens and the earth without any precedent. There was no Creator before Him. He is the One Who gives provision to whichever of His servants He wishes, and none of His servants provide for Him. He is not in any need of His servants, but His servants are in need of Him. Say, O Messenger: My Lord has instructed me to be the first one from this nation to submit and be humble. He has prohibited me from being of those who associate others as partners with Him."
"Say: ""If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a grievous Day.""",14,6,قُلْ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّى عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"Say, O Messenger: If I go against Allah by committing that which He has prohibited (such as associating partners with Him) or by leaving out what He has instructed me to do (such as having faith and doing good actions), then I fear that He will punish me with a severe punishment on the Day of Rising."
"Whosoever is spared that Day will surely have mercy shown to him, and this will be a clear triumph.",15,6,مَّن يُصْرَفْ عَنْهُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَقَدْ رَحِمَهُۥ وَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,The person from whom Allah keeps away and removes the punishment on the Day of Rising has attained success through the mercy of Allah. Such salvation and safety from the punishment is a clear victory which no other victory can equal.
"If God sends you harm, there is no one but He who can take it away; and if He bring you good, surely He has power over everything.",16,6,وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُۥٓ إِلَّا هُوَ وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"If any calamity from Allah afflicts you, O son of Adam, there is no one who can remove it from you besides Allah. If any good from Him comes to you, there is no one who can stop Him from that. There is no one who can hold back Allah’s grace. He has power over everything and nothing can overpower Him."
"It is He who prevails over His creatures, and He is all-wise and aware.",17,6,وَهُوَ ٱلْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِۦ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"He is the One Who is powerful and dominant and nothing can overpower or defeat Him: everything is subservient to Him. He is above His servants as His appropriate for Him, may He be glorified. His is the Wise in His creating, handling of matters and institution of laws. He is the Aware and nothing is hidden from Him."
"Ask: ""Of all things what is most vital as evidence?"" Say: ""God (who) is witness between you and me that this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may warn you on its strength, and those whom it reaches. Do you really bear witness there are other gods with God?"" Tell them: ""I bear no such Witness."" Say: ""Verily He is the only God, and I am clear of what you associate (with Him).""",18,6,قُلْ أَىُّ شَىْءٍ أَكْبَرُ شَهَٰدَةً قُلِ ٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌۢ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَأُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانُ لِأُنذِرَكُم بِهِۦ وَمَنۢ بَلَغَ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً أُخْرَىٰ قُل لَّآ أَشْهَدُ قُلْ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ وَإِنَّنِى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters who deny you: Which thing is greatest and most honoured as a witness to my truthfulness? Say: Allah is the greatest and most honoured witness to my truthfulness. He is a witness between you and me. He knows what I have brought to you and how you respond. Allah has revealed this Qur’ān to me to warn you by it and to warn any human or jinn it reaches. You, O idolaters, believe that there are others worthy of worship together with Allah. Say, O Messenger: I do not bear witness to what you have acknowledged as it is false. Allah is only one God: He has no partner. I am free from all that you associate as partners with Him."
Those to whom We have given the Book know it distinctly as they know their sons; but those who are lost of soul do not believe.,19,6,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَعْرِفُونَهُۥ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَآءَهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The Jews who were given the Torah and the Christians who were given the Gospel recognise the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) completely, just as they recognise their own children from other children. They are the ones who have lost their own souls by making them enter the fire of Hell, and they will not believe."
And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God or denies His revelations? Surely the wicked will not succeed.,20,6,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَٔايَٰتِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"The greatest wrongdoer is the person who attributes a partner to Allah and worships him together with Allah, or the person who denies Allah’s words that He revealed to His Messenger. Those who do wrong by ascribing partners to Allah and denying His verses will never succeed if they do not repent."
"The day We shall gather all of them together and say to those who ascribe (partners to God): ""Where are the compeers who you claimed (were equal to God)?""",21,6,وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوٓا۟ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآؤُكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,"Remember the Day of Rising when I will gather them all together, not leaving any one of them out, and criticise those who worshipped others besides Allah: ‘Where are your partners that you used to claim were partners to Allah?’"
"Then their excuse will be but to say: ""By God our Lord, we were not idolaters.""",22,6,ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُن فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوا۟ وَٱللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ,"After this test, they will have no excuse and they will declare themselves free of what they worshipped, by dishonestly saying: By Allah, our Lord, we did not associate partners with You in the world; but we had faith in You and we accepted Your Oneness."
"You will see how they will lie against themselves, and all their slanderings will be vain.",23,6,ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"Look, O Muhammad, how these people lied about themselves by denying that they associated partners with Allah. The partners that they set-up with Allah in this worldly life have disappeared and deserted them."
"There are some among them who listen to you; but We have put a covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand it, and a deafness appears in their ears. Even if they saw all the signs they would not believe in them; and even when they come to you to dispute with you, the unbelievers say: ""This is nothing but fables of antiquity.""",24,6,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهَا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءُوكَ يُجَٰدِلُونَكَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"Some of the idolaters listen to you, O Messenger, when you recite the Qur’ān, but they do not benefit from what they hear because I have placed covers on their hearts so that they cannot understand the Qur’ān. I did this due to their stubbornness and their turning away. I have made their ears deaf to beneficial listening. Despite the clear indications and glaring evidences that they see, they still do not believe, such that when they come to you they present false arguments against the truth and say: What you have brought has simply been taken from the books of the earlier people."
"And they forbid others from (believing in) it, and themselves keep away from it. But they ruin none but themselves, and do not understand.",25,6,وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْـَٔوْنَ عَنْهُ وَإِن يُهْلِكُونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"These idolaters forbid people from accepting the Messenger as they themselves stay away from doing so: they do not let others benefit in the same way that they themselves do not benefit. By acting like this, they only destroy themselves; but they fail to realise that they are bringing about destruction."
"If you should see them when they are stood before the Fire, they will say: ""Ah would that we were sent back (to the world)! We shall not deny the signs of our Lord, and be among those who believe.""",26,6,وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذْ وُقِفُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ فَقَالُوا۟ يَٰلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"If you, O Messenger, could only see them when they will be exposed to the fire of Hell on the Day of Rising, and they will regretfully say, ‘If only we could be sent back to the world, not deny Allah’s words and be from those who had faith in Allah’, then you would see a remarkable sight of their trouble."
"But no. What they were hiding has now become clear to them. If they were sent back they would surely return to what had been forbidden them, for surely they are liars.",27,6,بَلْ بَدَا لَهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّوا۟ لَعَادُوا۟ لِمَا نُهُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"Their saying that they would believe if sent back is a lie. Instead the statement that they used to keep hidden, which was ‘By Allah, we were not idolaters,’ has appeared to them when their limbs gave testimony against them. If they were supposedly sent back to the world, they would return to the disbelief and associating partners with Allah that they had been prohibited from. So they are lying in their promise that they will believe if they are sent back."
"They say: ""There is no other life but that of this world, and we will not be raised (from the dead).""",28,6,وَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنْ هِىَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ,"These idolaters say, ‘There is no life but the life we presently have and we will not be raised to give account’."
"If you see them when they are put before their Lord, He will say to them: ""Is not this the truth?"" They will answer: ""Indeed, by our Lord."" He will say: ""Then taste the agony of punishment for what you had denied.""",29,6,وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذْ وُقِفُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ قَالَ أَلَيْسَ هَٰذَا بِٱلْحَقِّ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّنَا قَالَ فَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,"If you, O Messenger, could only see when those who denied the resurrection will be made to stand before their Lord, you would see a remarkable sight of their trouble when Allah will say to them: Is this resurrection that you used to deny not the truth about which there is no doubt? They will say: I swear by our Lord Who created us, it is certainly true and there is no doubt about it. Allah will then say to them: Taste the punishment that is a result of your denial of this day, which you used to reject in the life of the world."
"They are surely lost who call the meeting with God a lie. When the Hour comes upon them unawares, they will say: ""Alas, we neglected it!"" and carry their burdens on their backs: How evil the burden they will carry!",30,6,قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً قَالُوا۟ يَٰحَسْرَتَنَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِيهَا وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلَا سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,"Those who deny the resurrection on the Day of Rising, and regard standing before Allah to be farfetched, are in utter loss. Until, when the Hour comes upon them suddenly without any prior knowledge, they will say, because of extreme regret: Alas for us and what disappointment, due to our having been neglectful of Allah by disbelieving Him and not preparing for the Day of Rising. They will carry their evil actions on their backs. How terrible are those evil actions that they carry!"
"As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity. The final abode is the best for those who are pious and fear God. Do you not comprehend?",31,6,وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَلَلدَّارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"The life of the world that you incline towards is nothing but a play and deception for a person who does not perform actions to please Allah. The home of the Afterlife is better for those who are mindful of Allah: doing what He has instructed them to do (such as having faith and following Him) and avoiding what He has prohibited (such as associating partners with Him and committing sin). Do you, idolaters, not understand this, so that you can believe and do good actions?"
"We know what they say distresses you. It is not you in fact they accuse of lies, but the wicked deny the revelations of God!",32,6,قَدْ نَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَحْزُنُكَ ٱلَّذِى يَقُولُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يُكَذِّبُونَكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,"I know that their outer denial of you, O Messenger, upsets you. Know that inside they do not deny you, because they know your truthfulness and honesty. Instead, they are people who do wrong because of their rejection of Allah’s words and they therefore dislike what you have brought and deny it on the outside."
Many an apostle has been accused of lies before you. Yet they bore with fortitude the falsehoods and the hurt until our help arrived. There is no changing the word of God: The news of (past) apostles has come to you already.,33,6,وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا كُذِّبُوا۟ وَأُوذُوا۟ حَتَّىٰٓ أَتَىٰهُمْ نَصْرُنَا وَلَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكَ مِن نَّبَإِى۟ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Do not think that such a denial is only in relation to what you have brought. Messengers before you were also denied and harmed by their communities, but they faced this with patience in their calling towards Allah and striving in His path until help came to them from Allah. No one can hold back the help that Allah has written and promised to His messengers. Information about the messengers before you and the difficulties they faced in their communities, and information about the help that Allah gave them by destroying their enemies, has come to you, O Messenger."
"If their aversion still weighs upon you, seek out a tunnel (going deep) into the earth, or a ladder reaching out to the skies, and bring them a sign: (Even then they will not believe). If God had willed He would have brought them all to the right path. So be not like the pagans.",34,6,وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم بِـَٔايَةٍ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"If their denial and turning away from the truth you have brought is difficult for you, O Messenger, then see if you can find a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky so that you may bring them more proof in addition to what I have already given you. If Allah willed to guide them to the guidance that you brought, He would have done so. However, He has not willed this because of His wisdom. So do not be among those who are ignorant of this and lose yourself in regret over their denial."
"Only they will respond who can hear. As for the dead, raised they will be by God, then to Him they will be returned.",35,6,إِنَّمَا يَسْتَجِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْمَعُونَ وَٱلْمَوْتَىٰ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,Only those who listen to the speech and understand it will respond to what you have brought. The disbelievers are dead and worthless because their hearts have died. Allah will raise the dead on the Day of Rising and then they will be returned to Him for Him to repay their actions.
"They say: ""How is it no miracle was sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say: ""God certainly has power to send down a miracle; but most men cannot understand.""",36,6,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يُنَزِّلَ ءَايَةً وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"The idolaters make stubborn demands and delay acceptance of faith, and say: Why has no extraordinary sign been sent down to Muhammad as a proof from His Lord about the truth of what he has brought? Say, O Messenger: Allah is able to send down a sign as you wish, but most of these idolaters, who demand that a sign be sent down, do not know that signs are only sent down in accordance with Allah’s wisdom and not according to their demands. If He was to send it down and they still did not believe, then He would destroy them."
"There is not a thing that moves on the earth, no bird that flies on its wings, but has a community of its own like yours. There is nothing that We have left out from recording. Then they will all be gathered before their Lord.",37,6,وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَٰٓئِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّآ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ,"There is no animal on earth or any bird flying in the sky except that they are species like you, O children of Adam, with respect to their creation and provision. I have not left out anything in the Preserved Tablet. The knowledge of all of them is with Allah. Then they will all be gathered to their Lord on the Day of Rising for the final decision and each will be recompensed according to what they deserve."
"Those who deny Our revelations are deaf, dumb, and lost in the dark. God sends whosoever He wills astray, and leads whom He will to the straight path.",38,6,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا صُمٌّ وَبُكْمٌ فِى ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ مَن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يُضْلِلْهُ وَمَن يَشَأْ يَجْعَلْهُ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Those who deny our verses are like those who are deaf and cannot hear, and like those who are dumb and cannot speak. Together with this they are in total darkness, in which they cannot see. So how can such a person be guided? Allah misguides whomever He wills from among people and guides whomever He wills by placing such a person on a straight path that has no crookedness."
"Say: ""Have you thought if the punishment of God or the Hour (of Doom) came upon you, would you call to any other than God? Answer, if you are men of truth.""",39,6,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَىٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Tell me, if a punishment from Allah comes to you or if the Hour that you have been promised comes to you, will you call on anyone besides Allah at that time to remove the calamity and difficulty that has come upon you? This is if you are truthful that those whom you worship can bring benefit and remove harm."
"No: You will call to Him alone; and He will, if He please, remove (the distress) for which you had called Him; and forget those you associate as compeers (with Him)",40,6,بَلْ إِيَّاهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِن شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ,"The truth is that when the Hour comes you not call anyone besides Allah Who created you, and He removes the calamity and takes away harm as He is worthy of that and able to do so, if He so wills. As for what you worshipped as gods, you will leave them because you know that they cannot bring benefit nor cause harm."
"We have indeed sent (apostles) to many a people before you, and inflicted upon them hardships and afflictions so that they might submit.",41,6,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُم بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,"I sent messengers to many communities before you, O Messenger, but those communities denied their messengers and turned away from what they brought. I then tried them with poverty and sickness in order for them to submit and humble themselves before their Lord."
"Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came upon them? But their hearts were hardened, and Satan made things they were doing look attractive to them.",42,6,فَلَوْلَآ إِذْ جَآءَهُم بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُوا۟ وَلَٰكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"If only they had humbled themselves before Allah, when His calamity came to them, and begged Allah to remove the calamity, then He would have shown them mercy. But they did not do that. Instead, their hearts became hard and they did not take notice and learn a lesson. Satan made the disbelief and sins that they were committing seem good to them, so they continued with those actions."
"When they had become oblivious of what they were warned, We opened wide the gates of everything to them; yet as they rejoiced at what they were given, We caught them unawares, and they were filled with despair.",43,6,فَلَمَّا نَسُوا۟ مَا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَٰبَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَرِحُوا۟ بِمَآ أُوتُوٓا۟ أَخَذْنَٰهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُونَ,"When they ignored the warning of extreme poverty and sickness, and did not follow Allah’s instructions, He enticed them further away from the truth by opening the doors of provision to them, and giving them wealth after they were poor. He also blessed them with good health after they had suffered sickness. This continued until they were steeped in their pride and enjoyment of life; then His punishment came upon them suddenly, and they were overtaken by despair and lost all hope."
"Thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last. All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.",44,6,فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ وَٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"The last of the disbelievers was cut off by being wiped out altogether when the help came to Allah’s messengers. Thanks and praise is only for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, for destroying His enemies and helping His friends."
"Say: ""Imagine if God takes away your hearing and sight, and sets a seal on your hearts, what deity other than God will restore them to you?"" See how We inflect Our signs: Even then they turn aside.",45,6,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَٰرَكُمْ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُم مَّنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِهِ ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ ثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Tell me, if Allah has to make you deaf by taking away your hearing, make you blind by taking away your sight, and seal your hearts so that you do not understand anything, what other being deserving worship is there that will bring all of these back to you? Think, O Messenger, about how we explain the evidence to them in various ways, yet they still turn away from it."
"Say: ""Imagine if the punishment of God were to come unawares, or openly, who will perish but the evil-doers?""",46,6,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَىٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ بَغْتَةً أَوْ جَهْرَةً هَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلَّا ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"Tell me, if Allah’s punishment comes to you suddenly without your realizing it, or if it comes to you openly before your eyes, then is it not so that only those who do wrong by disbelieving Allah and His messengers will be destroyed, and only those who have faith in Allah and follow His messengers will be saved."
We do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn. Then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret.,47,6,وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ فَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"I send our messengers only to inform the people of faith and obedience of the glad tidings of everlasting delight that will never end, and to warn the people of disbelief and sin of My severe punishment. Whoever accepts the messengers and sets right his actions, they will have no fear for what awaits them in the Afterlife, nor will they grieve over the pleasures of the world that they missed."
But those who deny Our messages will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient.,48,6,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْسُقُونَ,"Those who deny our signs will be afflicted by the punishment because they opposed Allah. If they had not gone against Him, but fulfilled His instructions and stayed away from His prohibitions, then the punishment would not have afflicted them."
"Tell them: ""I do not say that I possess the treasures of God, or have knowledge of the Unknown, or that I am an angel. I only follow what is sent down to me."" And say: ""How can a blind man and a man who can see, be alike? Will you not reflect?""",49,6,قُل لَّآ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِندِى خَزَآئِنُ ٱللَّهِ وَلَآ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ وَلَآ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّى مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ أَفَلَا تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: I do not say to you that I have with me Allah’s treasures of provision and that I can do with them as I please. I also do not say to you that I know the Ghaib, besides the revelation that Allah has shown me. I also do not say to you that I am an angel. I am the Messenger of Allah and I only follow what is revealed to me. I do not claim that which is not right for me. Is the disbeliever whose sight is blind to the truth equal to the believer who sees the truth and has faith in it? Do you, idolaters, then not think about the signs around you?"
"Warn those who fear, through this (Qur'an), that they will be gathered before their Lord, and they will have none to protect or intercede for them apart from Him. They may haply take heed for themselves.",50,6,وَأَنذِرْ بِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ لَيْسَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ وَلِىٌّ وَلَا شَفِيعٌ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"Warn, O Messenger, with this Qur’ān those who fear that they will be gathered to their Lord on the Day of Rising, when they will have no friend besides Allah to bring them any benefit, nor any intercessor to remove harm from them, so that they may be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. These are the people who will benefit from the Qur’ān."
"Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all. If you drive them away you will only be unjust.",51,6,وَلَا تَطْرُدِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَوٰةِ وَٱلْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُۥ مَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ وَمَا مِنْ حِسَابِكَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَتَطْرُدَهُمْ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Messenger, do not remove from your gathering those poor Muslims who sincerely worship Allah in the beginning and at the end of the day. Do not chase them away in order to win favour with the leaders of the idolaters. You are in no way accountable for these poor people. It is only Allah Who will take them to account. They, too, are in no way accountable for you. If you drive them away from your gathering, you will be of those who overstep Allah’s limits."
"Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: ""Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?"" Does God not know who are the grateful?",52,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولُوٓا۟ أَهَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنۢ بَيْنِنَآ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"So I tested them by means of one another. I made some of them rich and others poor. I made them different with respect to their worldly fortunes. I tested them in this way so that the rich disbelievers say about the poor believers: Are these poor people the ones whom Allah has favoured with guidance from amongst us? If this faith was any good, then they would not have beaten us to it, because we are the people who come first. Does Allah not know those who are thankful for His favours, so He guides them to faith, from those who deny these favours, so He abandons them to disbelief? Certainly, Allah knows about them."
"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: ""Peace on you."" Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind.",53,6,وَإِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَقُلْ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةَ أَنَّهُۥ مَنْ عَمِلَ مِنكُمْ سُوٓءًۢا بِجَهَٰلَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَنَّهُۥ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"When those who accept My signs that indicate the truth of what you have brought come to you, O Messenger, then reply to their greeting of peace in honour of them and tell them the good news of My mercy. I have gracefully made mercy obligatory on Myself. If anyone among you commits sin, out of ignorance and foolishness, and then repents from that sin and sets their actions right, then I will forgive them, for I am Forgiving and Compassionate to the servant who repents to Me."
Thus distinctly do We explain Our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct.,54,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ سَبِيلُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"So just as I have explained what was previously mentioned, I explain to you the Qur’ān to make the truth clear for the sake of practicing it; and to make clear the path of the guilty ones, so that it can be avoided."
"Tell them: ""I am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from God."" And say: ""I will not follow your wishes. If I do, I shall be lost and not be one of those who follow the right path.""",55,6,قُلْ إِنِّى نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قُل لَّآ أَتَّبِعُ أَهْوَآءَكُمْ قَدْ ضَلَلْتُ إِذًا وَمَآ أَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, ‘Allah has prohibited me from worshipping those whom you worship besides Him’. Say, O Messenger: I do not follow your desires in worshipping other than Allah. If I had followed your desires, I would go astray from the path of truth and I would not be guided to it. This is the condition of any person who follows his desires without any proof from Allah."
"Tell them: ""A clear proof has come to me from my Lord, and Him you deny. But what you wish to be hastened is not within my power. The judgement is only God's. He unfolds the Truth, and is the best of judges.""",56,6,قُلْ إِنِّى عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى وَكَذَّبْتُم بِهِۦ مَا عِندِى مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِۦٓ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ يَقُصُّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْفَٰصِلِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, not on vain desires, yet you have denied this evidence. I do not have the punishment and the extraordinary signs that you demand and that you are in such haste to bring about. That is only in Allah’s control. The decision for anything, including what you demand, is only Allah’s. He speaks the truth and decides accordingly. Allah, may He be glorified, is the best of those who decide between truth and falsehood."
"Say: ""If what you wish to be hastened were in my power, all matters between you and me would have been settled; God is cognisant of those who are unjust.""",57,6,قُل لَّوْ أَنَّ عِندِى مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِۦ لَقُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Messenger, say to them: If I had in my possession the punishment that you are in such haste to bring about, I would have brought it down on you. If that happens, the matter between us will be settled. Allah knows best about the duration of respite for those who do wrong and He knows best when to punish them."
"He has the keys of the Unknown. No one but He has knowledge; He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkest (recess) of the earth, nor any thing green or seared that is not recorded in the open book (of nature).",58,6,وَعِندَهُۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"The treasures of the Ghaib are with Allah alone: no one besides Him knows them. He knows all the created things in the land, such as animals, plants and inanimate objects. He knows whatever animals or plants there are in the sea. No leaf falls in any place, nor is there any seed of grain hidden in the earth, nor any thing moist or dry, except that it is recorded in a clear book which is the Preserved Tablet."
"It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled. Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did.",59,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يَتَوَفَّىٰكُم بِٱلَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِٱلنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ لِيُقْضَىٰٓ أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah is the One Who temporarily takes away your souls at night as you sleep, and He is the One Who knows the actions you do during the day when you are awake. He then raises you in the day, after taking away your souls through sleep, so that you may carry out your tasks. This will continue until the fixed period of your lives, as known to Allah, is over. Then you will return to Him alone when He will raise you on the Day of Rising. He will then tell you about what you used to do in the life of the world and will repay your actions."
"He has power over His creatures, and appoints guardians to watch over them. When death comes to one of you, Our messengers take away his soul, and do not falter.",60,6,وَهُوَ ٱلْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُمْ حَفَظَةً حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لَا يُفَرِّطُونَ,"And Allah is the Dominant and Irresistible to Whom everything is subjugated. He is above His servants in a manner that befits His majesty, may He be glorified. He sends over you, O people, honourable angels who record your actions. This will continue until a person’s life is brought to an end by the angel of death and his aides take away their souls. The angel of death and his aides never fail to carry out what they are instructed to do."
"Then they are taken to God, their real lord and master. His indeed is the judgement; and He is swift at reckoning.",61,6,ثُمَّ رُدُّوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَوْلَىٰهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ أَلَا لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ ٱلْحَٰسِبِينَ,"Then all those whose souls were taken away will be returned to Allah, their real master, for Him to repay their actions. To Him belongs the effectual decision and fair judgement between them. He is the swiftest of those who take account as He will take all of them to account in one day."
"Ask: ""Who is it who comes to your rescue in the darkness of the desert and the sea, and whom you supplicate humbly and unseen: 'If You deliver us from this, we shall indeed he grateful?'",62,6,قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُم مِّن ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُۥ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَىٰنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِۦ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Who rescues you and saves you from the calamity? You call on Him alone, humbling yourselves in secret and in public saying: If our Lord delivers us from this destruction we will certainly be of those who show thanks for His favours on us and we will not worship anyone besides Him."
"Say: ""God delivers you from this and every calamity. Even then you ascribe compeers (to Him)!""",63,6,قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُم مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ,"Say to them, O Messenger, ‘Allah is the One Who rescues you from it and delivers you from every distress. Then you still associate others as partners with Him when you are in good times. What can be more wrong than this?"
"Say: ""He has power to send you retribution from the skies above, or the earth beneath your feet, or confound you with divisions among you, and give one the taste of the vengeance of the other."" See, how distinctly We explain Our signs that they may understand.",64,6,قُلْ هُوَ ٱلْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابًا مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعًا وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُم بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ,"Say to them, O Messenger: Allah is the One able to send upon you a punishment that will come to you from above, such as stones, thunder-bolts and floods, or that will come to you from below, such as earthquakes and sinking into the ground. He can also cause disunity between your hearts, making each person follow their desire and making you fight one another. Think, O Messenger, about how I explain to them the evidence in various ways, so that they realise that what you have brought to them is the truth and what they have is false."
"This (Book) has been called by your people a falsehood though it is the truth. Say: ""I am not a warden over you.""",65,6,وَكَذَّبَ بِهِۦ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُم بِوَكِيلٍ,"Your people have denied this Qur’ān, yet it is the truth about which there is no doubt that it is from Allah. Say to them, O Messenger: I am not responsible for your actions. I am only to warn you before a severe punishment."
A time is fixed for every prophecy; you will come to know in time.,66,6,لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Everything has a time in which it occurs and an end point which it reaches. This includes your end results. You will soon come to know them when you are raised on the Day of Rising.
"When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things. In case the Devil makes you forget, leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this.",67,6,وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا۟ فِى حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِۦ وَإِمَّا يُنسِيَنَّكَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَلَا تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"When you, O Messenger, see the idolaters speaking about My verses mockingly, then do not sit with them until they enter into a discussion free of such mockery. If Satan makes you forget, and you do sit with them and afterwards remember, then leave that gathering and do not sit with those who overstep the limits."
"As for the heedful and devout, they are not accountable for them, but should give advice: They may haply come to fear God.",68,6,وَمَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ وَلَٰكِن ذِكْرَىٰ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"Those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding things He has not prohibited are in no way responsible for anything in the account of these wrongdoers. Their duty is only to prohibit them from the evil they are doing, so that they also may become mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding things He has not allowed."
"Leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith, and have been seduced by the life of this world. Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done. He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him. They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts. There will be scalding water to drink for them and painful punishment, for they had disbelieved.",69,6,وَذَرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ لَعِبًا وَلَهْوًا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَذَكِّرْ بِهِۦٓ أَن تُبْسَلَ نَفْسٌۢ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِىٌّ وَلَا شَفِيعٌ وَإِن تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ لَّا يُؤْخَذْ مِنْهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُبْسِلُوا۟ بِمَا كَسَبُوا۟ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْفُرُونَ,"Leave, O Messenger, these idolaters who have made their religion a thing of play and distraction and who mock and poke fun at it. The life of the world with its temporary pleasures has deceived them. Advise people, O Prophet, using this Qur’ān, so that no soul is delivered to destruction because of the evil actions it has done. If it so acts, it will have no one to help it nor any intercessor to protect it against Allah’s punishment on the Day of Rising. If it has to offer any ransom to be saved from Allah’s punishment, such will not be accepted from it. Those are the ones who have been delivered to their destruction because of the sins they committed. On the Day of Rising, they will have a drink that will be extremely hot and a painful punishment because of their disbelief."
"Say: 'Should we call in place of God one who can neither help nor do us harm, and turn back after having been guided by God, like a man beguiled by the devils who wanders perplexed in the wilderness while his friends call him back to the right path, saying: 'Come to us, this way?' Say: ""God's guidance is (true) guidance, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.",70,6,قُلْ أَنَدْعُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُنَا وَلَا يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰٓ أَعْقَابِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ كَٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَهْوَتْهُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُۥٓ أَصْحَٰبٌ يَدْعُونَهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَى ٱئْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَأُمِرْنَا لِنُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Shall we worship, besides Allah, idols that have no ability to benefit us, nor can they harm us with? Shall we turn back from faith after Allah has guided us to it? If we do so, we will be like the one whom satans have misled: leaving him confused, not knowing the right path; and where he has companions on the straight path who call him to the truth, but he refuses to respond to their call. Say to them, O Messenger: Allah’s guidance is the true guidance, and He has instructed us to submit to Him, may He be glorified, by being firm in our belief in His Oneness and by worshipping Him alone, because He is the Lord of the Worlds."
"Observe (your) devotional obligations and fear (God), for it is He before whom you will be gathered (in the end).""",71,6,وَأَنْ أَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"I have been instructed to establish the prayer in a complete way. I have also been instructed to be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and staying away from things He has prohibited. He, alone, is the One Who will gather the servants before Him on the Day of Rising, in order to judge them for their actions."
"It is He who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose. The day He will say ""Be, "" it will be. His word is the truth, His alone the power on the Day when the blast of the trumpet will be sounded. He knows the hidden and the visible. He is all-prudent and all-knowing.",72,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُن فَيَكُونُ قَوْلُهُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى ٱلصُّورِ عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. On the day when Allah will say to something ‘Be’ and it will become, refers to the Day of Rising when Allah will say ‘Rise’ and they will all rise. His word is the truth that will most certainly occur. On the Day of Rising, when the angel Isrāfīl will blow the trumpet for a second time, all control will be Allah’s alone. He knows what is hidden and what can be seen. He is Wise in His creating and handling of matters. He is Aware about the hidden just as He knows the apparent, and nothing is hidden from Him."
"Remember when Abraham said to Azar, his father: ""Why do you take idols for God? I certainly find you and your people in error.""",73,6,وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ ءَازَرَ أَتَتَّخِذُ أَصْنَامًا ءَالِهَةً إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰكَ وَقَوْمَكَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Abraham (peace be upon him) said to his father, Āzar, who was a idolater: O father, do you make the idols into gods that you worship besides Allah? I think that you and your people who worship idols are clearly misguided from and confused about the path of truth because of your worship of others besides Allah. Allah is the only Being that deserves to be worshipped, and nothing else has a right to be worshipped."
"Thus We showed to Abraham the visible and invisible world of the heavens and the earth, that he could be among those who believe.",74,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُرِىٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلِيَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُوقِنِينَ,"In the same way I showed Abraham the misguidance of his father and his people, I also showed him the vast kingdom of the heavens and the earth, so that he could use that as an indication of Allah’s Oneness and of His being the only One deserving of worship. This also made him certain that Allah is One without any partner and that He has power over everything."
"When the night came with her covering of darkness he saw a star, and (Azar, his father) said: ""This is my Lord."" But when the star set, (Abraham) said: ""I love not those that wane.""",75,6,فَلَمَّا جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلَّيْلُ رَءَا كَوْكَبًا قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّى فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لَآ أُحِبُّ ٱلْءَافِلِينَ,"When the darkness of the night came over Abraham, he began to debate with his people in order to bring them from idolatry to monotheism. His people used to worship the stars, so when he saw a star he said, ‘This is my Lord’, with the aim of convincing his people. When the star disappeared, he said, ‘I do not like that which disappears, because the true God is always present and never disappears’. The belief of his people was that gods do not go away and disappear, so he used this same belief of theirs as an argument against them."
"When (Azar) saw the moon rise all aglow, he said: ""This is my Lord."" But even as the moon set, (Abraham) said: ""If my Lord had not shown me the way I would surely have gone astray.""",76,6,فَلَمَّا رَءَا ٱلْقَمَرَ بَازِغًا قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّى فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لَئِن لَّمْ يَهْدِنِى رَبِّى لَأَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,"When Abraham saw the moon rising, he said to his people, ‘This is my Lord’, continuing his argument against them. When it disappeared, he said, ‘If Allah does not guide me to His Oneness and worship I will certainly become one of the people who are astray from His religion and who worship others besides Him’."
"When (Azar) saw the sun rise all resplendent, he said: ""My Lord is surely this, and the greatest of them all."" But the sun also set, and (Abraham) said: ""O my people, I am through with those you associate (with God).",77,6,فَلَمَّا رَءَا ٱلشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّى هَٰذَآ أَكْبَرُ فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَتْ قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنِّى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,"When he saw the sun rising, he said to his people, ‘This thing that is rising is my Lord. It is bigger than the star and the moon’, further continuing his plan of argument and proof against them. When it disappeared, he said, ‘O my people, I am free of what you associate as partners with Allah’."
"I have truly turned my face towards Him who created the heavens and the earth: I have chosen one way and am not an idolater.""",78,6,إِنِّى وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّذِى فَطَرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا وَمَآ أَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"I have devoted my religion to Allah Who created the heavens and the earth without any precedent, throwing off idolatry and embracing pure monotheism. I am not one of the idolaters who worship others besides Allah."
"His people argued, and he said: ""Do you argue with me about God? He has guided me already, and I fear not what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills, for held within the knowledge of my Lord is everything. Will you not reflect?",79,6,وَحَآجَّهُۥ قَوْمُهُۥ قَالَ أَتُحَٰٓجُّوٓنِّى فِى ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَىٰنِ وَلَآ أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ رَبِّى شَيْـًٔا وَسِعَ رَبِّى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًا أَفَلَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"Abraham’s people, who were idolaters, disputed with him with respect to Allah’s Oneness and they threatened him with their idols. He said to them: Do you argue with me about Allah’s Oneness and worshipping Him alone when my Lord has guided me to it? I do not have any fear of your idols, because they have no ability to harm or benefit, unless Allah wills. Whatever Allah wills happens. Allah’s knowledge covers everything and nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Him. Will you, then, not be mindful, O people, and stop your disbelief and associating of partners with Allah and believe in Him alone?"
"And why should I fear those you associate with Him when you fear not associating others with God for which He has sent down no sanction? Tell me, whose way is the way of peace, if you have the knowledge?",80,6,وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَآ أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلَا تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِۦ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَٰنًا فَأَىُّ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِٱلْأَمْنِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"How can I be fearful of the idols you worship besides Allah when you have no fear of your associating as partners with Allah things that He created, without having any proof for doing so? Which of the two groups, the monotheists or the idolaters, is more deserving of safety and security? If you know which group is more deserving, then follow that group. The more deserving group is undoubtedly the group of the believers who are monotheists."
"They alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial, and are guided on the right path.""",81,6,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوٓا۟ إِيمَٰنَهُم بِظُلْمٍ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلْأَمْنُ وَهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,"Those who believe in Allah follow His laws and did not pollute their faith with polytheism, they will be the ones who will be safe and secure. They are the ones to whom their Lord has shown the path of guidance."
This is the argument We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt whosoever We please in rank by degrees. Your Lord is wise and all-knowing.,82,6,وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَٰتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,"The argument of the setting of the star, moon and sun, which Abraham used to defeat his people in the debate, is My argument, which I showed and gave him to use against his people. I raise in rank whichever of My servants I wish in this world and the Afterlife. Your Lord, O Messenger, is Wise in His creation and handling of matters, and He knows about His servants."
"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus We reward those who are upright and do good.",83,6,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥٓ إِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلًّا هَدَيْنَا وَنُوحًا هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِۦ دَاوُۥدَ وَسُلَيْمَٰنَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"I blessed Abraham with his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, and I guided each of them to the straight path. Before them, I guided to the path of truth Noah; and from the descendants of Noah, I guided David, his son Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and his brother Aaron (peace be upon them). Just as I gave the prophets a reward for doing good, I will give a similar reward to all those who do good, even if they are not prophets."
"Zachariah and John We guided, and guided Jesus and Elias who were all among the upright.",84,6,وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَإِلْيَاسَ كُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"In a similar way, I guided Zachariah, John, Jesus son of Mary and Elijah (peace be upon them). All these prophets were of the righteous, who were chosen by Allah to be messengers."
"We gave guidance to Ishmael, Elisha and Jonah and Lot; And We favoured them over the other people of the world,",85,6,وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَٱلْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطًا وَكُلًّا فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"In a similar way, I guided Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot (peace be upon them). I favoured all of them with prophethood, with Muhammad (peace be upon him) being the best of them, superior to all other people."
"As We did some of their fathers and progeny and brethren, and chose them, and showed them the right path.",86,6,وَمِنْ ءَابَآئِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّٰتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَٰنِهِمْ وَٱجْتَبَيْنَٰهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَٰهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"I also guided some of their forefathers, descendants and brothers, whom I had willed to guide. I selected them and made them take the straight path: the path of Allah’s Oneness and His obedience."
"This is God's guidance: He gives among His creatures whom He will. If they had associated others with Him, surely vain would have been all they did.",87,6,ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا۟ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"The guidance they received was Allah’s guidance, which He grants to whomever of His servants He wills. If they had associated others as partners to Allah, then their actions would be void, because associating partners with Allah nullifies good actions."
Those were the people to whom We gave the Book and the Law and the Prophethood. But if they reject these things We shall entrust them to a people who will not deny.,88,6,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ فَإِن يَكْفُرْ بِهَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْمًا لَّيْسُوا۟ بِهَا بِكَٰفِرِينَ,"The prophets mentioned are the ones to whom I had given divine scriptures, wisdom and prophethood. If your people deny any of these things which I have given to them, then I have prepared other people who do not disbelieve, but who accept and hold firm onto it. They are the Emigrants (Muhājirūn) and the Helpers (Anṣār), and all those who follow them in good until the Day of Reward."
"Those were the people who were guided by God; so follow their way. Say: ""I ask no recompense of you for this. It is but a reminder for all the people of the world.""",89,6,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ فَبِهُدَىٰهُمُ ٱقْتَدِهْ قُل لَّآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Those prophets and their forefathers, descendants and brothers mentioned are truly the people of guidance, so follow and imitate them. Say, O Messenger, to your people: I do not want any reward from you for conveying this Qur’ān. The Qur’ān is simply an advice for the human beings and jinn of the worlds, so that they can be guided to the straight path by it."
"But they failed to make a just estimation of God when they said: ""He did not reveal to any man any thing."" Ask them: ""Who then revealed the Book that Moses brought, -- a guidance and light for men, -- which you treat as sheafs of paper, which you display, yet conceal a great deal, though through it you were taught things you did not know before, nor even your fathers knew?"" Say: ""God,"" and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse.",90,6,وَمَا قَدَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِۦٓ إِذْ قَالُوا۟ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَىْءٍ قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ٱلَّذِى جَآءَ بِهِۦ مُوسَىٰ نُورًا وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ تَجْعَلُونَهُۥ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيرًا وَعُلِّمْتُم مَّا لَمْ تَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنتُمْ وَلَآ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِى خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,"The idolaters did not venerate Allah as He should be venerated when they said to their prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), ‘Allah has not sent down any revelation to any human being’. Say to them, O Messenger: Who is the One who sent down the Torah to Moses, as a light and guidance for his people? The Jews put it into sheets; and they show what agrees with their desires and conceal what does not, such as the description of Muhammad (peace be upon him). You, O Arabs, were taught the Qur’ān, which neither you nor your predecessors knew. Say to them, O Messenger, ‘Allah sent it down’, then leave them to their ignorance and misguidance, until the most certain thing – death – comes to them."
"And this (Qur'an) is another Book that We have revealed, blessed, affirming the earlier (revelations), so that you may warn the people of (Makkah) the town of towns, and those who live around it. Those who believe in the life to come shall believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations.",91,6,وَهَٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ ٱلَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلِتُنذِرَ أُمَّ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَهُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ,"And this Qur’ān is a book that I revealed to you, O Prophet. It is a blessed book that confirms the heavenly scriptures that came before it, and was revealed to you so that you could warn the people of Mecca and all the people in the East and West to come to the right path. Those who believe in the life of the Hereafter accept this Qur’ān, practice it and guard their prayer by maintaining its requirements, essentials and recommended acts at the times set in the sacred law."
"Who is more vile than he who slanders God of falsehood, or says: ""Revelation came to me,"" when no such revelation came to him; or one who claims: ""I can reveal the like of what has been sent down by God?"" If you could see the evil creatures in the agony of death with the angels thrusting forward their hands (saying): ""Yield up your souls: This day you will suffer ignominious punishment for uttering lies about God and rejecting His signs with arrogance.""",92,6,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ قَالَ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إِلَيْهِ شَىْءٌ وَمَن قَالَ سَأُنزِلُ مِثْلَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذِ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَٰتِ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ بَاسِطُوٓا۟ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَخْرِجُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"The greatest wrongdoer is the person who makes up lies about Allah by saying, ‘Allah has not revealed anything to any human being’; or by falsely saying, ‘Allah has sent revelation to me’, when Allah did not send any revelation to him; or by saying, ‘I will reveal the like of the Qur’ān that Allah has revealed’. O Messenger, you would see a terrible sight if you could see these wrongdoers at the time of death; and when the angels will stretch out their hands to punish and beat them, and reprimand them by saying: Remove your souls because we are here to take them. Today you will be repaid with a punishment that will disgrace and humiliate you because of the lies that you used to say about Allah by claiming prophethood, revelation or the ability to reveal what Allah has revealed, and because of your being too proud to accept His signs."
"""You have come before Us all alone,"" (God will say), ""as when you were created first, leaving behind all that We had bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors with you who, you imagined, had partnership with you. Shattered lie your ties with them now, and gone are the claims you made.""",93,6,وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَٰدَىٰ كَمَا خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُم مَّا خَوَّلْنَٰكُمْ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ وَمَا نَرَىٰ مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَٰٓؤُا۟ لَقَد تَّقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنكُم مَّا كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,"They will be told on the Day of Resurrection: You have come to us today individually. Now you do not have any wealth or leadership, and you have come to Me just as I had created you the first time: barefoot, naked and uncircumcised. You have reluctantly left behind what I had given you in the world. I do not see with you today your idols, which you claimed will intercede for you and that they are Allah’s partners with respect to their being deserving of worship. All links between you have been cut. Your claim of their intercession and that they are Allah’s partners has vanished from you."
"Indeed it is God who splits up the seed and the kernel, and brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living. This is God: So whither do you stray?",94,6,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَالِقُ ٱلْحَبِّ وَٱلنَّوَىٰ يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَىَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَمُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتِ مِنَ ٱلْحَىِّ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,"Allah alone is the One who splits open the seed, from which crops emerge, and the date-stone, from which the date palm sprouts. He creates the living from the dead, just as man and all other animals are formed from sperm; and He creates the dead from the living, just as sperm comes out of a human being and an egg is laid by a chicken. The Being who does this is Allah, the One Who created you. How are you, idolaters, then misled from the truth, despite your witnessing His marvellous creation?"
"He ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and moon a computation. Such is the measure appointed by Him, the omnipotent and all-wise.",95,6,فَالِقُ ٱلْإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ ٱلَّيْلَ سَكَنًا وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ حُسْبَانًا ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,"He, may He be glorified, splits the light of dawn from the darkness of the night. He is the One Who has made the night still, in which people can take rest from the tiring and hard work of the day. He is the One Who has made the sun and the moon move according to a precise measure. That marvellous creation is the determination of the Mighty, Whom none can overpower, the One Who knows what is best for His creation."
It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise.,96,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلنُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُوا۟ بِهَا فِى ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One who created for you, O children of Adam, the stars in the sky, so that you may be guided by them during your travels when the routes on the land and sea are unclear. I have explained the proofs and evidences that indicate My power for a people who reflect and take benefit from them."
"It is He who produced you from a single cell, and appointed a place of sojourning, (the womb of the mother), and a place of depositing, (the grave). How clear have We made Our signs for those who understand.",97,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ فَمُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمُسْتَوْدَعٌ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَفْقَهُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who created you from one soul, which was the soul of your father, Adam. He began your creation by forming your father, Adam, from clay and then He created you from him. He also created for you a place for you to settle in, which is the wombs of your mothers, and a depository in which you are stored, which is the loins of your fathers. I have explained the signs to a people who can understand the words of Allah."
"It is He who sends down water from the skies, and brings out of it everything that grows, the green foliage, the grain lying close, the date palm trees with clusters of dates, and the gardens of grapes, and of olives and pomegranates, so similar yet so unlike. Look at the fruits, how they appear on the trees, and they ripen. In all these are signs for those who believe.",98,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِۦ نَبَاتَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهُ خَضِرًا نُّخْرِجُ مِنْهُ حَبًّا مُّتَرَاكِبًا وَمِنَ ٱلنَّخْلِ مِن طَلْعِهَا قِنْوَانٌ دَانِيَةٌ وَجَنَّٰتٍ مِّنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَٱلزَّيْتُونَ وَٱلرُّمَّانَ مُشْتَبِهًا وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَٰبِهٍ ٱنظُرُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ ثَمَرِهِۦٓ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَيَنْعِهِۦٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكُمْ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who sent down rain water from the sky and then with it He caused all types of vegetation to grow. From the vegetation He brought out crops and green trees, from which He produces grain that is packed one of top of the other, as it is found in spikes. From the spathe of the date-palm come clusters that are close to any person standing or sitting. He also brought out grape orchards; and produces olives and pomegranates, the leaves of which are similar but the fruit are different. Look, O people, at the fruit when it first appears and when it ripens. O people, in that there are clear proofs of Allah’s power for a people who believe in Allah. Such people are the ones who will benefit from these proofs."
"Yet they ascribe to jinns a partnership with God, although He created them; and they ascribe to Him sons and daughters, without possessing any knowledge. All praise be to Him. He is much too exalted for things they associate (with Him).",99,6,وَجَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ ٱلْجِنَّ وَخَلَقَهُمْ وَخَرَقُوا۟ لَهُۥ بَنِينَ وَبَنَٰتٍۭ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"Yet the idolaters made the jinn partners with Allah in worship believing that the jinn can independently bring benefit and cause harm, whilst Allah alone had created them, so He is most worthy of being worshipped. And out of their ignorance they attributed sons to Allah – as the Jews did with respect to ‘Uzayr’, and the Christians with respect to Jesus – and also daughters. Allah is free and above what the people of falsehood claim about Him."
"Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, how could He have a son when He has no mate? He created all things, and has knowledge of all things.",100,6,بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُن لَّهُۥ صَٰحِبَةٌ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"He, may He be glorified, is the Creator of the heavens and the earth without any precedent. How can he have a child when he has no wife? He created everything and knows everything. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"This is God, your Lord; there is no god but He, the creator of all things. So pay homage to Him, for He takes care of everything.",101,6,ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,"O people, the Being that has those divine attributes is your Lord. You have no lord besides Him, and there is no one worthy of worship besides Him. He is the Creator of everything, so worship Him alone as He is the only one deserving of worship. He takes care of everything."
"No eyes can penetrate Him, but He penetrates all eyes, and He knows all the mysteries, for He is all-knowing.",102,6,لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ ٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ ٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"Vision cannot encompass Him, but His Vision covers and encompasses all things. He is the One Who is Subtle with His righteous servants and is Aware of them."
"To you have come signs from your Lord, (and the light of understanding). So any one who sees (and understands) does so for himself, and any one who turns blind shall suffer the consequences alone. (Say:) ""I am not a guardian over you (to make you understand).""",103,6,قَدْ جَآءَكُم بَصَآئِرُ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ فَلِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَنْ عَمِىَ فَعَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنَا۠ عَلَيْكُم بِحَفِيظٍ,"Clear proofs from your Lord have come to you, O people. Whoever understands them and is mindful, the benefit of that will return to him. Whoever is blind to them and unmindful, it will only be to his loss. It is not my duty to watch over you and record your actions: I am only a messenger from my Lord. He is the One Who watches over you."
"Thus in varied ways We explain Our signs so that they may say: ""You have been instructed,"" and that We might make it clear to those who understand.",104,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَلِيَقُولُوا۟ دَرَسْتَ وَلِنُبَيِّنَهُۥ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Just as I explained the various types of proofs of My Power, I also explain the various types of ayahs containing promises, threats and advice. And so the idolaters will say: This is not revelation: it is merely something you learnt from the People of the Scripture before you. And I did this in order to explain the truth to the believers of the nation of Muhammad (peace be upon them ), as they are the ones who accept the truth and follow it."
"So follow what is sent down to you by your Lord, for homage is due to no one but God, and turn away from idolaters.",105,6,ٱتَّبِعْ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Follow, O Messenger, the truth that your Lord reveals to you. There is no one worthy of worship besides Him, may He be glorified. Let your heart not be concerned with the disbelievers and their stubbornness, as their matter is left to Allah."
"Had He willed they would not have been idolaters. We have not appointed you their guardian, nor are you their pleader.",106,6,وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكُوا۟ وَمَا جَعَلْنَٰكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ,"If Allah willed for them not to associate any one as partner with Him, they would not have done so. I have not made you, O Messenger, a guardian to record their actions, nor are you in charge of them. You are only a messenger and your duty is only to convey the message."
"Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance. We have made attractive their deeds to every people. They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do.",107,6,وَلَا تَسُبُّوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَسُبُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَدْوًۢا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ كَذَٰلِكَ زَيَّنَّا لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ عَمَلَهُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِم مَّرْجِعُهُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"O believers, do not insult the idols that they worship alongside Allah, even though they be deserving of that, for then the idolaters due to ignorance would insult Allah unknowingly, may He be glorified. Just as He made their misguidance fair seeming to them, He makes the behaviour of every nation, be it good or bad, seem good to them and so they act accordingly. Then their return on the Day of Rising is to their Lord, Who will inform them about what they used to do in the world and repay their actions."
"They solemnly swear by God: ""If a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it."" Tell them: ""The signs are with God."" Yet for all you know they will not believe if the signs came to them.",108,6,وَأَقْسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْءَايَٰتُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ أَنَّهَآ إِذَا جَآءَتْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The idolaters swear by Allah, with their strongest oaths, that if Muhammad (peace be upon him) brings them one of the signs they asked for, then they will believe. Say to them, O Messenger: I do not have signs so that I may bring them: they are only with Allah, Who sends them down as He wills. And what will inform you, O believers, that if these signs come, as they request, they still will not believe? Instead, they will persist in their denial and stubbornness, because they in fact do not want to be guided."
"We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, for they did not believe them at the very first, and leave them to wander perplexed in bewilderment.",109,6,وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْـِٔدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهِۦٓ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"And I will turn their hearts and vision, by intervening between them and preventing their guidance to the truth, just as I intervened between them and faith in the Qur’ān the first time because of their stubbornness. I will leave them in their misguidance and rebellion against their Lord, confused and wandering."
"Even if We send down the angels to them, and the dead should speak to them, and We gather all things before their eyes, they will not believe, unless God should will, for most of them are ignorant.",110,6,وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ قُبُلًا مَّا كَانُوا۟ لِيُؤْمِنُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ,"If I had responded to them by bringing what they requested – by sending down the angels for them to see, and made the dead speak to them about the truth of what you brought, and gathered everything they asked for before their eyes – they still would not have believed in what you brought, unless Allah willed for them to be guided. However, most of them are ignorant of this and do not turn to Allah to grant them guidance."
"That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk. But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate.",111,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوًّا شَيَٰطِينَ ٱلْإِنسِ وَٱلْجِنِّ يُوحِى بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ ٱلْقَوْلِ غُرُورًا وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ مَا فَعَلُوهُ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ,"Just as I tested you with the hostility of these idolaters towards you, I tested every prophet before you. I made for each of them enemies of rebellious men and jinn, who used to whisper evil in the hearts of one another, beautifying falsehood in order to deceive them. If I willed them not to do so, they would not have done that; but I willed it as a test for them. So leave them to their fabrications of disbelief and falsehood, and pay no attention to them."
"Let those who do not believe in the life to come, listen to it and be pleased with it, and let them gain what they may gain.",112,6,وَلِتَصْغَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ أَفْـِٔدَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلِيَرْضَوْهُ وَلِيَقْتَرِفُوا۟ مَا هُم مُّقْتَرِفُونَ,"This is so that the hearts of those who do not accept the Afterlife may incline towards what they whisper to one another, happily accepting such things for themselves, and that they persist in committing the sins and wrongs they were doing."
"(Say): ""Then should I seek (the source of) law elsewhere than God, when it is He who has revealed this Book to you, which distinctly explains (everything)?"" Those to whom We have given the Book know it has been sent by your Lord in truth. So be not a sceptic.",113,6,أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْتَغِى حَكَمًا وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مُفَصَّلًا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُۥ مُنَزَّلٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters who worship others together with Allah: Does it make sense for me to accept anyone other than Allah as a judge between us whilst Allah is the One Who has revealed the Qur’ān which sufficiently explains everything. The Jews, to whom I gave the Torah, and the Christians, to whom I gave the Gospel, know that the Qur’ān has been revealed to you, because the proof of that is found in their scriptures. So do not be of those who doubt about what I revealed to you."
"Perfected are the laws of your Lord in truth and justice, and there is no changing His laws. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.",114,6,وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقًا وَعَدْلًا لَّا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,The word of your Lord – namely the Qur’ān – is complete in the truthfulness of its statements and the justice of its instructions and prohibitions. There is no one who can alter His words. He is the One Who hears and knows the statements of His servants. Nothing is hidden from him and He will repay their actions.
"If you follow the majority of people on the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of God, for they follow only conjecture and surmise.",115,6,وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ,"If you, O Messenger, supposedly followed most of the people on earth, they would mislead you from Allah’s religion. Allah’s custom has always been that the truth is with the minority. Most people follow nothing but speculation that has no basis and they think that those whom they worship will bring them close to Allah, whereas they are completely wrong in believing this."
"Your Lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path, and knows those who are rightly guided.",116,6,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ مَن يَضِلُّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, knows best those people who are misled from His path; and He knows best those who are rightly guided to it. Nothing of that is hidden from Him."
"Eat only that over which the name of God has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His commands.",117,6,فَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا ذُكِرَ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُم بِـَٔايَٰتِهِۦ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"Eat, O people, from that which was slaughtered while using Allah’s name, if you truly accept His clear proofs."
"And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors.",118,6,وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا ذُكِرَ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُم مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا ٱضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَّيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَآئِهِم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"What is it that prevents you, O believers, from eating that which was slaughtered in Allah’s name, when Allah has made clear what is unlawful for you. It is therefore necessary for you to leave that which is forbidden, unless you are forced by necessity to eat it, in which case it will be lawful. Many of the misguided idolaters mislead their followers with their incorrect views. They consider lawful that which Allah has made unlawful (such as carrion), and they consider unlawful that which Allah has made lawful (such as the baḥīrah, waṣīlah, ḥāmī, etc.). Your Lord, O Messenger, knows best those who overstep His limits and He will repay them for their transgression."
Discard both the visible and invisible sin. For those who sin will be punished for what they have done.,119,6,وَذَرُوا۟ ظَٰهِرَ ٱلْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ ٱلْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَقْتَرِفُونَ,"O people, avoid committing sins openly or in secret. Those who commit sins, secret or open, will be repaid by Allah for what they did."
"Do not eat of that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater.",120,6,وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَفِسْقٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَوْلِيَآئِهِمْ لِيُجَٰدِلُوكُمْ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ,"O Muslims, do not eat that which was not slaughtered in the name of Allah, whether the name of someone other than Allah was mentioned over it or not. Eating such forbidden food is to abandon obedience to Allah in favour of disobedience. The satans whisper to their friends, inspiring them with doubts, so that they argue with you about eating carrion. If you, O Muslims, were to follow them in the doubts they present for the lawfulness of carrion, then you would be equal to them in associating partners with Allah."
"Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers.",121,6,أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَٰهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُۥ نُورًا يَمْشِى بِهِۦ فِى ٱلنَّاسِ كَمَن مَّثَلُهُۥ فِى ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ لَيْسَ بِخَارِجٍ مِّنْهَا كَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Is the one who was dead prior to receiving Allah’s guidance – due to his disbelief, ignorance and sins, and then He gave him life by guiding him to faith, knowledge and obedience – equal to the one who cannot leave the darkness of disbelief, ignorance and sins, and to whom the paths have become unclear and dark? Just as polytheism, the consumption of carrion, and false arguments were made fair seeming to these idolaters, the sins of the disbelievers were made to seem good to them, so that they are repaid for them on the Day of Rising with a painful punishment."
And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know.,122,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا فِى كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ أَكَٰبِرَ مُجْرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُوا۟ فِيهَا وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلَّا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"Just as what transpired with those leaders of Mecca who committed polytheism and barred others from the Way of Allah, He has placed leaders and influential people in every town who use various means and schemes to call towards the path of Satan and oppose the messengers and their followers. In reality, their scheming and planning will eventually only harm them, but they do realise this due to their ignorance and their following of desires."
"Every time a sign comes to them they say: ""We shall never believe till what God's apostles had been given comes to us."" God knows best where to direct His messages. A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving.",123,6,وَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ قَالُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ ٱللَّهِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُۥ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا۟ صَغَارٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَمْكُرُونَ,"And when there comes to any of these leaders a verse or a sign which Allah reveals to His Prophet proving his truthfulness, they say: We will never accept this until Allah bestows upon us the Prophethood as He did to those Prophets aforetime. Allah refutes them by saying that He knows best who is most suitable to be appointed to carry out the duties of the mission and He only selects the finest people for prophethood and messengership. These transgressors will be afflicted with disgrace and humiliation because of their arrogance against the truth, and with a severe punishment because of their scheming."
"Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe.",124,6,فَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُۥ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُۥ لِلْإِسْلَٰمِ وَمَن يُرِدْ أَن يُضِلَّهُۥ يَجْعَلْ صَدْرَهُۥ ضَيِّقًا حَرَجًا كَأَنَّمَا يَصَّعَّدُ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَذَٰلِكَ يَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Whomever Allah wishes to guide to the right path, He opens their heart to Islam so they accept it willingly. Whomever He wishes to abandon and not guide, He makes their chest extremely narrow and unable to accept the truth, such that they become like a person climbing into the higher layers of the atmosphere while finding it increasingly difficult to breathe. Just as Allah made this extreme narrowness the condition of the person who goes astray, He will place the punishment on those who do not have faith in Him."
This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.,125,6,وَهَٰذَا صِرَٰطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيمًا قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"This religion that I have given you, O Messenger, is My straight path, in which there is no crookedness. I have made the ayahs clear for the one who has understanding."
For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their defender as reward for what they did.,126,6,لَهُمْ دَارُ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Such people will be awarded Paradise on the Day of Judgement, in which they will be safe from every type of harm and discomfort. Allah will be their Friend, Protector, Supporter and Guardian. This will be their reward for the good actions they used to do."
"On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) ""O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men."" But their proteges among men will say: ""O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us."" ""Your abode is Hell,"" He will say, ""where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise."" Verily your Lord is wise and all-knowing.",127,6,وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا يَٰمَعْشَرَ ٱلْجِنِّ قَدِ ٱسْتَكْثَرْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْإِنسِ وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُم مِّنَ ٱلْإِنسِ رَبَّنَا ٱسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ وَبَلَغْنَآ أَجَلَنَا ٱلَّذِىٓ أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا قَالَ ٱلنَّارُ مَثْوَىٰكُمْ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ إِلَّا مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Remember, O Messenger, the day when Allah will gather both the jinn and humankind. He will address the jinn and tell them that they had misled many people and prevented them from Allah’s path. Their followers among humankind will say in response to their Lord: O our Lord, we benefited from one another: the jinn benefited by having human beings follow them; and the human beings benefited by using the jinn to obtain their desires. And now we have reached the term that You have appointed for us and this is now the Day of Rising. Allah will tell them that the fire of Hell will be their home, where they will live eternally, with the exception of those sinful monotheists whom Allah wills to remove from it. Your Lord, O Messenger, is Wise in His planning and handling of matters; He knows which of His servants deserves the punishment."
Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds.,128,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُوَلِّى بَعْضَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بَعْضًۢا بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Just as I gave some of the rebellious jinn the ability to mislead some people, I will give an authority and power to every evil sinner so that they may influence other sinners-prompting them to do evil and create a dislike in their hearts and turn them away from good. This is a just recompense for the sins they used to commit."
"O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)?"" They will answer: ""We bear witness to our sins."" They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers.",129,6,يَٰمَعْشَرَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتِى وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَٰذَا قَالُوا۟ شَهِدْنَا عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِنَا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَشَهِدُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ كَٰفِرِينَ,"On the Day of Rising, I will address jinn and humankind, and ask them if messengers from their own species had not come to them reciting to them what Allah had revealed to them and warning them that they will meet this day, which is the Day of Rising. They will say: Of course they did. Today we confess against ourselves that Your messengers did communicate Your message to us and we admit the meeting of this day; but we had rejected Your messengers and denied the meeting of this day. The life of the world with its temporary beauty, decorations and luxuries had deceived them, and they will admit against themselves that they disbelieved in Allah and His messengers in the world. Yet this confession and acceptance will not be of any use to them, as the time for its usefulness would have already passed."
And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.,130,6,ذَٰلِكَ أَن لَّمْ يَكُن رَّبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا غَٰفِلُونَ,The reason for sending messengers to mankind and jinn is so that no one is punished for the crimes they committed without a messenger having been sent to warn them and the invitation reaching them. I only punished a nation after sending messengers to them.
"Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do.",131,6,وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَٰتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُوا۟ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,"Each one of them will have ranks in accordance to their actions. The person who did a great deal of evil will not be equal to the one who did less. The followers will not be equal to those who were followed. Similarly, the reward for those who do good will not be the same. Your Lord is not unaware of what they used to do. Instead, He is well aware of that. Nothing of it is hidden from Him and He will repay them for their actions."
"Your Lord is all-sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others.",132,6,وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ذُو ٱلرَّحْمَةِ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِنۢ بَعْدِكُم مَّا يَشَآءُ كَمَآ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ ءَاخَرِينَ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, is Self-sufficient of His servants. He is not in need of them or their worship of Him. Their disbelief in Him does not harm Him. Despite His not being in need of them, He is Merciful towards them.If He wished to destroy you, O disobedient servants, He would destroy you with His punishment, and then after this He would bring others who would have faith in Him and obey Him, just as He created you from the progeny of other people who had come before you."
The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.,133,6,إِنَّ مَا تُوعَدُونَ لَءَاتٍ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,"The resurrection, rising, reckoning and punishment that you are promised, O disbelievers, will most certainly happen. You will not be able to escape from your Lord by running away: He will seize and punish you."
"Tell them: ""O my people, go on acting on your part, I am acting on mine. You will soon know whose is the guerdon of life to come."" The wicked will not succeed.",134,6,قُلْ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّى عَامِلٌ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن تَكُونُ لَهُۥ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلدَّارِ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: O my people, remain on your path of disbelief and misguidance if you choose, as I have fulfilled my obligation having established the evidence against you by communicating the message to you. I am therefore not concerned about your disbelief and misguidance. Instead, I will remain firm on the path of truth that I follow. Soon you will come to know who will be victorious in the world and inherit the earth, and who will receive the home of the Afterlife. The idolaters will not succeed, neither in this world nor the Afterlife. Their end result will be loss even though they may have some enjoyment in the world."
"They allocate a share from God's own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: ""This is God's"" -- or so they think -- ""and that, of the compeers of God,"" so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God's may reach the compeers (set up by them). How bad is the judgement that they make!",135,6,وَجَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ ٱلْحَرْثِ وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ نَصِيبًا فَقَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَٰذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلَا يَصِلُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,"The idolaters made innovations and false claims in their religion concerning Allah by assigning to Him a share of the crops and livestock that He created, and giving a share of what He created to their idols. Yet the share they gave to their partners does not reach the avenues that Allah requires them to be spent in, such as on the poor and destitute. But what they gave to Allah reaches the idols and is spent on them. How evil is their judgement and distribution!"
In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith. If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods.,136,6,وَكَذَٰلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَٰدِهِمْ شُرَكَآؤُهُمْ لِيُرْدُوهُمْ وَلِيَلْبِسُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فَعَلُوهُ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ,"Just as Satan made this unfair judgement fair seeming to the idolaters, the devils –who were their partners and associates – made it seem good to them that they should kill their children out of the fear of poverty. The devils inspired them with this in order to destroy them by their committing the act of murder, which Allah had made unlawful, and to make their religion confusing for them such that they did not know anymore what Allah had commanded or prohibited for them. If Allah had willed for them not to do this, they would not have done so. However, He willed it out of His wisdom. So leave, O Messenger, these idolaters and their fabrications about Allah, because that will not harm you, and entrust their matter to Allah."
"They also say: ""These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit,"" -- so they assert. ""And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden."" They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate.",137,6,وَقَالُوا۟ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أَنْعَٰمٌ وَحَرْثٌ حِجْرٌ لَّا يَطْعَمُهَآ إِلَّا مَن نَّشَآءُ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَأَنْعَٰمٌ حُرِّمَتْ ظُهُورُهَا وَأَنْعَٰمٌ لَّا يَذْكُرُونَ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا ٱفْتِرَآءً عَلَيْهِ سَيَجْزِيهِم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"The idolaters said that certain animals and crops were banned, and only those whom they wish may eat of them, such as those who worship the idols and others, according to their claim and fabrication. They also said that the backs of certain animals were forbidden and that no one could ride or carry a load on those animals. Then they claimed that the name of Allah must not be mentioned over certain animals at the time of slaughter and the names of idols must be taken instead. They falsely attributed all of this to Allah. Allah will repay them with His punishment because of what they made up about Him."
"And they say: ""Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still-born both could eat it."" God will punish them for what they assert. He is all-wise and all-knowing.",138,6,وَقَالُوا۟ مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَىٰٓ أَزْوَٰجِنَا وَإِن يَكُن مَّيْتَةً فَهُمْ فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,"They said: The foetus in the wombs of these reserved animals, if born alive, is permitted for our males and forbidden to our women. If it is stillborn, then the males and females will share in it. Allah will justly repay them for this statement. He is Wise in His sacred laws and in handling the affairs of His creation, and He knows full well about them."
"They will surely perish who kill their offspring in ignorance foolhardily, and forbid the food that God has given them by fabricating lies against God. Misguided are they surely, and will never come to guidance.",139,6,قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَتَلُوٓا۟ أَوْلَٰدَهُمْ سَفَهًۢا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَحَرَّمُوا۟ مَا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱفْتِرَآءً عَلَى ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّوا۟ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ,"Those who killed their children due to their foolishness and ignorance, and made unlawful the animals that Allah provided for them, falsely attributing this to Allah, are ruined. They have strayed from the straight path and are not guided to it."
"It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike. So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal.",140,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنشَأَ جَنَّٰتٍ مَّعْرُوشَٰتٍ وَغَيْرَ مَعْرُوشَٰتٍ وَٱلنَّخْلَ وَٱلزَّرْعَ مُخْتَلِفًا أُكُلُهُۥ وَٱلزَّيْتُونَ وَٱلرُّمَّانَ مُتَشَٰبِهًا وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَٰبِهٍ كُلُوا۟ مِن ثَمَرِهِۦٓ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَءَاتُوا۟ حَقَّهُۥ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِۦ وَلَا تُسْرِفُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, is the One Who created gardens raised above the ground by means of stems and trellises, and spread out gardens on the surface of the earth without any stems, He is the One Who created the date palm. He produced crops which differ in their shape and taste. He is the One Who created the olive and the pomegranate, the leaves of which are similar but their fruit is different. Eat, O people, from its fruit when it bears fruit and pay its Zakat on the day of its harvest. Do not overstep the limits of the sacred law with respect to eating and spending, because Allah does not love those who overstep His limits in this and other respects. Rather, He hates such people. The One Who created all of this is the One Who has made it lawful for His servants. Therefore, the idolaters have no right to declare it unlawful."
"He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter. So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy.",141,6,وَمِنَ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ حَمُولَةً وَفَرْشًا كُلُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"He is the One Who produced for you some animals suitable for carrying loads (such as big camels) and other animals not suitable for that purpose (such as small camels, goats and sheep). Eat, O people, of the permissible things that Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan by considering as lawful what Allah has forbidden and making unlawful what Allah has permitted, as the idolaters do. O people, O people, Satan is your clear enemy as He wants you to oppose Allah by doing so."
"There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats. Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs? Produce the sanction if you are truthful.",142,6,ثَمَٰنِيَةَ أَزْوَٰجٍ مِّنَ ٱلضَّأْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمَعْزِ ٱثْنَيْنِ قُلْ ءَآلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا ٱشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ نَبِّـُٔونِى بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"He created for you eight types: two types of sheep, male and female, and two types of goats. Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters: Did Allah make the two males unlawful because of their being male? If they say, ‘Yes,’ then ask them: Why do you regard the females as unlawful? Or did He make the two females unlawful because of their being female? If they say, ‘Yes,’ then ask them: Why do you regard the males as unlawful? Or did He make what the wombs of the two females contain unlawful because of being contained in the womb? If they say, ‘Yes,’ then ask them: Why do you differentiate between what the wombs contain by making the male unlawful sometimes and making the female unlawful at other times? Tell me, O idolaters, what proper knowledge do you base this on, if you are truthful in your claim that the prohibition for this is from Allah?"
"And there are two of camels and two of oxen. Ask them: ""Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?"" Were you present at the time God issued this command?"" Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants.",143,6,وَمِنَ ٱلْإِبِلِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ ٱلْبَقَرِ ٱثْنَيْنِ قُلْ ءَآلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا ٱشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ وَصَّىٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا لِّيُضِلَّ ٱلنَّاسَ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"The remainder of the eight types are a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters: Did Allah make any of them unlawful due to their being male or female or due to being contained in the womb? Were you, O idolaters, present when Allah gave the instruction for the prohibition of the animals that you regard as unlawful, according to your claim? There is no greater wrong and offence than a person who makes up lies about Allah, by attributing to Him the prohibition of that which He has not prohibited, in order to mislead people from the straight path without any basis. Allah does not guide to the right path those who do wrong by making up lies about Allah."
"You tell them: ""In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane. But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind.""",144,6,قُل لَّآ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَىٰ طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُۥٓ إِلَّآ أَن يَكُونَ مَيْتَةً أَوْ دَمًا مَّسْفُوحًا أَوْ لَحْمَ خِنزِيرٍ فَإِنَّهُۥ رِجْسٌ أَوْ فِسْقًا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلَا عَادٍ فَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Say, O Messenger: I do not find in what Allah has revealed to me anything forbidden except that which dies without being properly slaughtered, blood that is flowing, the meat of a pig – for that is impure and unlawful – or that which is slaughtered in the name of other than Allah (such as animals slaughtered in the name of idols). Whoever is forced by necessity to eat of these forbidden things due to extreme hunger, without looking for enjoyment by eating them and without exceeding the limit of necessity, there will be no sin on him in that. Your Lord, O Messenger, is Forgiving towards the person who is compelled to eat from that and is Compassionate towards such a person."
"We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true.",145,6,وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ حَرَّمْنَا كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ وَمِنَ ٱلْبَقَرِ وَٱلْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَآ إِلَّا مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَآ أَوِ ٱلْحَوَايَآ أَوْ مَا ٱخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ ذَٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَٰهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ وَإِنَّا لَصَٰدِقُونَ,"I made unlawful for the Jews animals whose toes were not separated (such as camels and ostriches). I also made unlawful for them the fat of cattle and sheep, except for what was attached to their backs or on their intestines or what was mixed with bone (such as the rump or flank). I repaid them for their disobedience by making these things unlawful for them. I am truthful in all that I relate."
"If they call you a liar, tell them infinite is the mercy of your Lord; but His vengeance will not be turned back from the sinners.",146,6,فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَٰسِعَةٍ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُۥ عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"If they deny you, O Messenger, and do not accept what you brought from your Lord, then say to them in encouragement: Your Lord is One, possessor of vast mercy. It is because of His mercy that He has given you relief and has not yet taken you to task by punishing you. Also say to them as a warning: His punishment is not averted from those who commit sins."
"But the idolaters say: ""If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing."" So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end. Ask them: ""Have you any knowledge? Then display it. You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars.""",147,6,سَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكْنَا وَلَآ ءَابَآؤُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَىْءٍ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُوا۟ بَأْسَنَا قُلْ هَلْ عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍ فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَآ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا تَخْرُصُونَ,"The idolaters will say, using Allah’s will and decree as proof for their associating partners with Him: If Allah had willed that neither we nor our ancestors associate any partners with Him we would not have done so; and if He had willed that we do not make anything unlawful for ourselves we would not have done so. Those before them also denied their messengers with similar worthless proofs saying: If Allah had willed that we do not prohibit them, we would not have done so. So they persisted in their denial until they tasted My punishment that I sent down on them. Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Do you have any evidence that indicates that Allah is pleased that you associate others with Him, and that you make lawful what He has prohibited, and make unlawful what He has allowed? Just because you did these actions does not mean that He is pleased with them. You are following nothing but speculation with respect to this and speculation holds no weight against the truth. You are only lying."
"Say: ""To God belongs the consummate argument. Had He willed He would surely have guided all of you aright.""",148,6,قُلْ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحُجَّةُ ٱلْبَٰلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَىٰكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters: If you only have these weak arguments, then Allah has a decisive argument against which the excuses you present hold no weight and before which the doubts that you cling to will disappear. If Allah had willed to guide all of you to the truth, O idolaters, He would have done so."
"Tell them: ""Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this)."" Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord.",149,6,قُلْ هَلُمَّ شُهَدَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَرَّمَ هَٰذَا فَإِن شَهِدُوا۟ فَلَا تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَهُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters who make unlawful what Allah has allowed and who claim that it is Allah who has made it unlawful: Bring your witnesses to testify that Allah has made these things unlawful. If they testify without any knowledge that Allah has made these things unlawful, then do not believe their testimony, O Messenger, because it is false testimony. Do not follow the desires of those who let their desires rule over them. They denied His verses when they made unlawful what Allah had allowed. Do not follow those who do not have faith in the Afterlife and who associate others with their Lord. How can a person who deals with his Lord in this way be followed?"
"Tell them: ""Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.",150,6,قُلْ تَعَالَوْا۟ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا۟ بِهِۦ شَيْـًٔا وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَٰنًا وَلَا تَقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَوْلَٰدَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَٰقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا۟ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِى حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّىٰكُم بِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the people: Come! I will read to you what Allah has made unlawful. He has made it unlawful that you associate any creation as partner to Him; that you disobey your parents – for it is your duty to be good to them; that you kill your children due to poverty – as the people during the period of ignorance used to do – I provide for you and for them. He has also made it unlawful that you go near immoral acts, whether they are done openly or in secret; and that you kill the soul that Allah has prohibited you from killing, unless it is done rightfully (such as in the case of adultery and apostasy). He has instructed you with what was mentioned so that you understand Allah’s instructions and prohibitions."
"Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed.",151,6,وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُۥ وَأَوْفُوا۟ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَٱعْدِلُوا۟ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَبِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْفُوا۟ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّىٰكُم بِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"He has prohibited you from becoming involved with the wealth of orphans – those who lose their father before maturity – until they became mature and are considered to be sensible, unless you do so in a manner that brings benefit and an increase in that wealth. He has also prohibited you from giving short measure or weight; rather, it is necessary that you are fair and just when taking or giving anything in a purchase and sale transaction. He does not burden a soul more than it can bear, and you will not be taken to task for any increase or decrease in measure that is unintentional. He has, likewise, prohibited you from saying that which is false when relating an incident or giving testimony, displaying unfair preference to a relative or friend. He has, too, prohibited you from breaking Allah’s pledge. If you make a pledge with Allah or in Allah’s name, then such pacts must be fulfilled. Allah has instructed you with the above in the hope that you would ponder over the outcomes of your actions."
"(He has further commanded:) 'This is My straight path, so walk along it, and do not follow other ways, lest you should turn away from the right one.' All this has He commanded. You may perhaps take heed for yourselves.""",152,6,وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطِى مُسْتَقِيمًا فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ ٱلسُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّىٰكُم بِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"He has prohibited you from following the paths of misguidance. You are required to follow Allah’s straight path, in which there is no crookedness. The paths of misguidance will lead you far away from the path of truth. Allah instructs you to follow the straight path in the hope that you will become mindful of Him by fulfilling His instructions and staying away from His prohibitions."
"To that end We gave the Book to Moses, a perfect law, distinctly explaining all things, and a guidance and grace, so that they should believe in the meeting with their Lord.",153,6,ثُمَّ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ تَمَامًا عَلَى ٱلَّذِىٓ أَحْسَنَ وَتَفْصِيلًا لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُم بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"After all this, I relate to you that I gave the Torah to Moses as a completion of My favour and a reward for his good actions, to make everything required in religion clear, and as a mercy in the hope that they would have faith in the meeting with their Lord on the Day of Judgement and prepare for it with good actions."
"Blessed is this Book We have revealed; so follow it and preserve yourself from evil that you may qualify for grace,",154,6,وَهَٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"And this Qur’ān is a book that I have revealed and is full of blessings because of the religious and worldly benefits it contains. So follow what is revealed in it, and be mindful of going against it, in the hope that you will be shown mercy."
"Lest you say: ""The Book that was sent before was meant only for two groups; we were not aware of their teachings;""",155,6,أَن تَقُولُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ عَلَىٰ طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَٰفِلِينَ,"This Book was revealed so that you, idolaters, do not say: Allah only revealed the Torah and the Gospel to the Jews and the Christians before us and He did not reveal any scripture to us. I do not know how to read their scriptures as they are in their language and not in ours."
"Or that: ""Had the Book been sent down to us we would surely have been guided better than they."" So you have now received from your Lord a clear proof and a guidance and grace. Then who is more wicked than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall punish those severely who turn away: A requital indeed for having turned aside.",156,6,أَوْ تَقُولُوا۟ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْكِتَٰبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا سَنَجْزِى ٱلَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِنَا سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَصْدِفُونَ,"Likewise, I sent this Book so that you do not say: If Allah had revealed a scripture to us, just as He did to the Jews and Christians, we would have been more upright than them. So now has Allah revealed the Book to your prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), in your language: a clear proof, guidance, and a mercy for the entire nation. Then do not offer false excuses and give invalid reasons for rejecting it. Surely the greatest wrongdoer is the person who denies Allah’s ayahs and turns away from them. Allah will punish those who turn away from His words with a severe punishment, by causing them to enter the fire of Hell as a repayment for their turning away from and ignoring them."
"What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord? The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith. Tell them: ""Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct).""",157,6,هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّآ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِىَ رَبُّكَ أَوْ يَأْتِىَ بَعْضُ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِى بَعْضُ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّكَ لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَٰنُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِىٓ إِيمَٰنِهَا خَيْرًا قُلِ ٱنتَظِرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ,"Those who deny the truth are not waiting for anything but for the angel of death and his assistants to come to them in order to take away their souls in the world; or for their Lord to come on the Day of Decision in the Afterlife, O Messenger, in order to make the final decision about them; or for some of the Lord’s signs that indicate the approach of the Final Hour. to come. On the day when some of your Lord’s signs come – such as the rising of the sun in the West – the faith of a disbeliever will not be of any benefit to him, nor will the good action of a believer who did not do good previously be of benefit to him. Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters who deny this, ‘Wait for one of these things; I am also waiting’."
"As for those who have created schisms in their order, and formed different sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is with God. He will tell them the truth of what they were doing.",158,6,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا۟ شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْعَلُونَ,"O Messenger, have nothing to do with those Jews and Christians who divided their religion, by taking part of it and leaving out another part, and turned into various sects. You are innocent of the misguidance that they adopt. Your duty is only to warn them. Their matter is entrusted to Allah and then, on the Day of Judgement, He will tell them about what they used to do in the world and repay them for that."
He who does a good deed will receive ten times its worth; and he who does evil will be requited to an equal degree; and no one will be wronged.,159,6,مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُۥ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَىٰٓ إِلَّا مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"Whoever of the believers brings a good action on the Day of Judgement, Allah will multiply it for them ten times. Whoever brings an evil action will only be punished with its equivalent amount, and not more than that. On the Day of Judgement, they will not be wronged by a reduction in the reward of good actions, nor by an increase in the punishment for evil actions."
"Tell them: ""My Lord has directed me to a path that is straight, a supreme law, the creed of Abraham the upright who was not an idolater.""",160,6,قُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَىٰنِى رَبِّىٓ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters who are in denial: My Lord has guided me to a straight path, which is the path of the religion that maintains the interests of this world and the Afterlife. It is the faith of Abraham who inclined to the truth and who was never one of those who associated others with Allah."
"Tell them: ""My service and sacrifice, my life and my death, are all of them for God, the creator and Lord of all the worlds.",161,6,قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Say, O Messenger: My prayer and sacrifice is for Allah and in His name, not for anyone else. My life and death is only for Allah, the Lord of all creation, and no one else has any share in that from me."
"No equal has He, I am commanded (to declare), and that I am the first to submit.""",162,6,لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُۥ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"He, may He be glorified, has no partner. There is no one else worthy of worship besides Him. Allah has instructed me to accept this pure monotheism and I am the first of those who acknowledge Him in this nation."
"Say: ""Shall I search for another lord apart from God when He is the only Lord of all and everything?"" Each soul earns (what it earns) for itself, and no man shall bear another's burden. You have to go back to your Lord in the end when He will tell you about the things you disputed.",163,6,قُلْ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْغِى رَبًّا وَهُوَ رَبُّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَلَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلَّا عَلَيْهَا وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُم مَّرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Shall I search for someone other than Allah as a Lord when He, may He be glorified, is the Lord of everything? He is the Lord of those things that you worship besides Him. No innocent person will bear the sin of another. Then your return will be to your Lord alone on the Day of Judgement, and He will inform you about religious matters that you used to differ about when you were in the world."
"It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.",164,6,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَٰٓئِفَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَٰتٍ لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌۢ,"Allah is the One Who made you successors of those whom came before you on earth, so that you inhabit it after them. He has raised some of you in rank over others – in terms of physical form, livelihood and other aspects – in order to test you through what He has given you. Your Lord, O Messenger, is quick in delivering justice, since anything that is approaching is close. And He is also Forgiving and Compassionate towards those of His servants who repent to Him."

He revealed it to you to warn people by it and to be a proof, and to remind those who have faith through it, because it is they who benefit from being reminded."
"Follow what has been revealed to you by your Lord, and do not follow any other lord apart from Him. Yet little do you care to remember.",2,7,ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Follow, O people, the Scripture which your Lord revealed to you, and the traditions of your Prophet. Do not follow the desires of those you imagine to be friends and protectors amongst the devils or evil scholars, turning to them and leaving what was revealed to you because of your desires. How little you remember! If you had remembered, you would not have preferred falsehood over the truth, and you would have followed what your Messenger came with, acting in obedience to it and leaving anything besides it."
Many a habitation have We laid low before: Our retribution came upon them in the night or in the midst of siesta at noon.,3,7,وَكَم مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَٰهَا فَجَآءَهَا بَأْسُنَا بَيَٰتًا أَوْ هُمْ قَآئِلُونَ,"How many cities Allah has destroyed through His punishment because they persisted in their disbelief and error! Allah sent His punishment down on them in their obliviousness at night or during the day: they could not do anything to avoid the punishment, and their false gods could do nothing to protect them from it."
"And when Our punishment overtook them they had nothing to say except crying out: ""We have indeed been sinners.""",4,7,فَمَا كَانَ دَعْوَىٰهُمْ إِذْ جَآءَهُم بَأْسُنَآ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,All they could do when the punishment came down on them was to admit that they had done wrong through their disbelief in Allah.
"(On the Day of Reckoning) We shall question the people to whom We had sent Our apostles, (if they followed their teachings), and will question the apostles.",5,7,فَلَنَسْـَٔلَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَنَسْـَٔلَنَّ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Allah will certainly question the communities He sent messengers to on the Day of Judgement: about how they received the messengers. Also, He will certainly question the messengers about whether they delivered what they were instructed to deliver, and how their communities responded to it."
"We shall recount (their deeds) to them with knowledge, for We were never absent (and saw all they did).",6,7,فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ عَلَيْهِم بِعِلْمٍ وَمَا كُنَّا غَآئِبِينَ,"Allah will inform everyone about what they did in the world, through His knowledge, because He was always aware of whatever they did. Nothing is hidden from Him, and He was never, at any point, absent from them."
"And the weighing will be just on that Day. Then those whose (deeds) are heavier in the balance will find fulfilment,",7,7,وَٱلْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْحَقُّ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"The weighing of what they did on the Day of Judgement will be with justice, with no one being wronged in the least. Those whose good actions weigh more than their bad actions have succeeded in reaching the goal and being saved from what they feared."
And those whose (deeds) are lighter in the scale shall perish for violating Our signs.,8,7,وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ,"Those whose bad actions weigh more than their good actions are the people who have lost themselves, gaining their destruction on the Day of Judgement and being excluded from eternal bliss because of their rejection of Allah’s signs and verses."
"We settled you on the earth, and provided means of livelihood for you in it; but little are the thanks you give.",9,7,وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَّٰكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَعَٰيِشَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah certainly established you, O children of Adam, on the earth, and gave you the means of making a living. You should be thankful to Allah for that, but you give little thanks."
"Verily We created you and gave you form and shape, and ordered the angels to bow before Adam in homage; and they all bowed but Iblis who was not among those who bowed.",10,7,وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِءَادَمَ فَسَجَدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُن مِّنَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"O people, Allah created your father Adam, making him in the best of forms and the best of designs. Then He commanded the angels to bow down to him, honouring him, so they did so, all bowing down, except for Iblīs, the Satan, who refused to bow down out of pride and stubbornness."
"""What prevented you"" (said God), ""from bowing (before Adam) at My bidding?"" ""I am better than him,"" said he. ""You created me from fire, and him from clay.""",11,7,قَالَ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَلَّا تَسْجُدَ إِذْ أَمَرْتُكَ قَالَ أَنَا۠ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِى مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُۥ مِن طِينٍ,"Allah asked Satan rebuking him: 'What stopped you from following My command to bow down to Adam?' Satan said: 'What prevented me is that I am better than Adam: You created me from fire and Adam from mud, and fire is greater then mud.'"
"So God said: ""Descend. You have no right to be insolent here. Go, and away; you are one of the damned.""",12,7,قَالَ فَٱهْبِطْ مِنْهَا فَمَا يَكُونُ لَكَ أَن تَتَكَبَّرَ فِيهَا فَٱخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰغِرِينَ,"Allah told Satan: 'Go down from Paradise, because it is not appropriate for you to be proud in it; as it is a place for those who are good and pure-hearted. You are O Satan disgraced and humiliated, even though you consider yourself to be superior to Adam."
"""Grant me respite,"" said he, ""till the raising of the dead.""",13,7,قَالَ أَنظِرْنِىٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,"Satan asked Allah: 'O my Lord, give me relief until the Day of Rising, so that I could tempt and misguide whomever of the children of Adam I am able to tempt.'"
"And God said: ""You have the respite.""",14,7,قَالَ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ,"Allah told Satan: 'You are O Satan given respite till the first blast of the trumpet when all created beings die, and the Creator alone remains.'."
"""Since You led me into error,"" said Iblis, ""I shall lie in wait for them along Your straight path.",15,7,قَالَ فَبِمَآ أَغْوَيْتَنِى لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَٰطَكَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,"Satan said: 'Because You have made me fall into error through not following Your command to bow down to Adam, I will surely sit in wait for the children of Adam upon Your straight path, to turn them away and mislead them from it, just as I was misled through not bowing down to Adam.'"
"And I shall come upon them from the front and behind, right and left; and You will not find among them many who would give thanks.""",16,7,ثُمَّ لَءَاتِيَنَّهُم مِّنۢ بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَآئِلِهِمْ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَٰكِرِينَ,"'I will surely come to them from every direction, causing them to neglect the Afterlife, and desire the life of this world, giving them doubts, and making their low desires seem beautiful to them. And You will not find O my Lord most of them thankful to You, because of the denial and ingratitude I will lead them to."
"""Begone,"" said (God), ""contemptible and rejected! As for those who follow you, I shall fill up Hell with all of you.",17,7,قَالَ ٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا مَذْءُومًا مَّدْحُورًا لَّمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Allah said: 'Go down from Paradise O Satan, humiliated and removed from My mercy. I will certainly fill Hell with you and all those who follow and obey you and go against My command."
"And you, O Adam, and your spouse, live in the Garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like, but do not approach this tree, or you will become iniquitous.""",18,7,وَيَٰٓـَٔادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَكُلَا مِنْ حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Then Allah told Adam: 'O Adam go and dwell you and your wife Eve in the Paradise, and eat from the good things in it, but do not approach and eat from that tree, for if you both eat from that tree after My prohibiting it you would be of those who transgress My limits.'"
"But Satan suggested (evil) to them, in order to reveal their hidden parts of which they were not aware (till then), and said: ""Your Lord has forbidden you (to go near) this tree that you may not become angels or immortal.""",19,7,فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ لِيُبْدِىَ لَهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ عَنْهُمَا مِن سَوْءَٰتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَىٰكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْخَٰلِدِينَ,Satan told them: 'Allah has only forbidden you from eating from that tree because He does not want you to become angels or to live eternally in Paradise.'
"Then he said to them on oath: ""I am your sincere friend;""",20,7,وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّى لَكُمَا لَمِنَ ٱلنَّٰصِحِينَ,"Satan swore to the two of them saying: 'By Allah I am to you both, O Adam and Eve, a sincere advisor in what I direct you to.'"
"And led them (to the tree) by deceit. When they tasted (the fruit) of the tree their disgrace became exposed to them; and they patched the leaves of the Garden to hide it. And the Lord said to them: ""Did I not forbid you this tree? And I told you that Satan was your open enemy.",21,7,فَدَلَّىٰهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ فَلَمَّا ذَاقَا ٱلشَّجَرَةَ بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَٰتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَنَادَىٰهُمَا رَبُّهُمَآ أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَن تِلْكُمَا ٱلشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُل لَّكُمَآ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ لَكُمَا عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"So Satan brought them down from their high position through trickery and deception. When they ate from the tree which they had been forbidden to eat from, their private parts became exposed and visible to them. So they started to fix leaves from Paradise onto themselves in order to cover up. Their Lord called to them: 'Did I not forbid you both from eating from this tree, and did I not warn you that Satan is your clear enemy?'"
"They said: ""O our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we shall certainly be lost.""",22,7,قَالَا رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَآ أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Adam and Eve said: 'O our Lord! We have wronged ourselves by doing what You forbade us from, and surely If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us we will be amongst the losers, losing our share of the worldly life and Hereafter.'"
"""Go,"" said God, ""one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.",23,7,قَالَ ٱهْبِطُوا۟ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Allah told Adam, Eve and Satan: 'Go down from Paradise to the earth, where some of you will be enemies of others, and where you would have a place to settle with enjoyment of what is in the earth until an appointed time.'"
"You will live there, and there will you die,"" He said, ""and be raised from there (On the Day of Doom).""",24,7,قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ,"Allah addressed Adam and Eve and their descendants: 'On this Earth you will live for the length of time I decree for you, and on this Earth you will die. After being buried, you will be taken out from your graves and brought back to life.'"
"O sons of Adam, We have revealed to you a dress that would both hide your nakedness and be an adornment, but the raiment of piety is best. This is one of the tokens of God: You may haply reflect.",25,7,يَٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَٰرِى سَوْءَٰتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"O children of Adam, Allah made for you clothing, necessary for covering your nakedness, and clothing for you to adorn yourselves with, and the clothing of Mindfulness, which is through following what Allah instructs and staying away from what He has not allowed, which is better than the physical types of clothing. What is mentioned here about clothing is from among the signs of Allah, showing His power over everything, so that perhaps people will remember His blessings to them and be thankful for them."
"O sons of Adam, let not Satan beguile you as he did your parents out of Eden, and made them disrobe to expose their disgrace to them. For he and his host can see you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe,",26,7,يَٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ كَمَآ أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا لِيُرِيَهُمَا سَوْءَٰتِهِمَآ إِنَّهُۥ يَرَىٰكُمْ هُوَ وَقَبِيلُهُۥ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا تَرَوْنَهُمْ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"O children of Adam, do not let Satan deceive you by making disobedience look beautiful to you, making you leave covering your nakedness with clothing, or leave the clothing of Mindfulness. Do not be deceived as he tricked your parents, making eating from the tree seem good to them, and the result of that was that he got them expelled from Paradise, and their nakedness became clear to them. Satan and his tribe watch and see you, and you cannot see or watch them, so always be on your guard against him and his tribe. Allah made the satans friends and helpers of those who do not have faith in Allah. As for those who have faith and do good, the satans have no way against them."
"Who say when they commit shameful acts: ""Our ancestors used to do so, and God has enjoined us to do the same."" Say to them: ""God never enjoins a conduct that is shameful. You impute such lies to God as you do not know.""",27,7,وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا۟ فَٰحِشَةً قَالُوا۟ وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَآ ءَابَآءَنَا وَٱللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"If the idolaters commit an indecent act, they defend it, saying they found their fathers doing it and that Allah had commanded them to do it. Tell them O Muhammad: 'Indeed Allah does not command the wrong, rather, He forbids it, so how can you claim such a thing about Him? Or are you O Idolators inventing things about Allah, saying what you do not know about Him?'"
"Tell them: ""My Lord has enjoined piety, devotion in all acts of worship, and calling upon Him with exclusive obedience. For you will be reverted back to what you were (when) created first.""",28,7,قُلْ أَمَرَ رَبِّى بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَٱدْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ كَمَا بَدَأَكُمْ تَعُودُونَ,"Say O Muhammad: 'Indeed Allah commands justice, not indecency or sin. And He commands loyalty to Him in worship generally, and particularly in places of worship, that you call on Him alone, sincere in your dedication to Him.' As He created you from nothing the first time, He will bring you back to life a second time. He Who is able to create you in the first place is able to return you and bring you back to life."
"A Section (among them) were guided, a section were bound to go astray, (for) instead of God they took the devils as their friends; yet they think they are on the right path.",29,7,فَرِيقًا هَدَىٰ وَفَرِيقًا حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةُ إِنَّهُمُ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,"Allah made people into two groups: one group of them He guided, making it easy for them to find guidance and removing the barriers to it; and another He made go astray from the path of truth, because they made the satans their friends and helpers instead of Allah, ignorantly becoming bound to them, considering themselves to be correctly guided to a straight path."
"O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for God does not like the prodigals.",30,7,يَٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ خُذُوا۟ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَكُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ وَلَا تُسْرِفُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"O children of Adam, dress beautifully in every place of worship, and eat and drink, but do not be extravagant. Truly, He does not love those who are extravagant. O children of Adam, wear clean, pure, beautiful, clothes that cover your nakedness when you pray and when you make circumambulation of the Kaaba. Eat and drink whatever you like from the good things that Allah has allowed. But do not be extravagant in this, nor go beyond what is allowed. Allah does not love those who go beyond the limits.."
"Ask them: ""Who forbids you attire that God has given to His creatures, and the good things that He has provided?"" Tell them: ""They are (meant) for believers in the world, and will be theirs on the Day of Judgement."" That is how We explain Our signs to those who know.",31,7,قُلْ مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِۦ وَٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلرِّزْقِ قُلْ هِىَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا خَالِصَةً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Say O Messenger to the idolaters who forbid what Allah has allowed of clothing and food; 'Who has forbidden you from wearing clothes as adornment, and who has forbidden you from eating the good things I have provided you to eat and drink?' Say to them O Messenger: 'These good things to eat and drink and wear are in this world, for the believers; while others may share in them in this world, they are exclusively for the believers on the Day of Judgement when the disbelievers will not have a share in them, because the disbelievers have been forbidden Paradise.' Likewise Allah makes clear His signs and ayahs in this way for people who reflect, because it is they who benefit from them."
"Tell them: ""My Lord has forbidden repugnant acts, whether open or disguised, sin and unjust oppression, associating others with God, of which He has sent down no authority, and saying things of God of which you have no knowledge.""",32,7,قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّىَ ٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَٱلْإِثْمَ وَٱلْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِۦ سُلْطَٰنًا وَأَن تَقُولُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Say O Messenger (peace be upon him) to inform the idolaters who have forbidden what Allah has allowed: 'Indeed Allah has only forbidden lewd indecent acts done openly or secretly, all forms of disobedience, and transgressing unjustly against people in terms of their selves, wealth, or honour. And He has forbidden worshipping others next to Him – for which there is no proof to do so. And He has forbidden that you say things about Him wihout knowledge, in terms of His Names, Attributes, Actions and sacred law."
A term is fixed for every people; and when their appointed time is come there will neither be a moment's delay nor haste.,33,7,وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"Every generation and people are given a fixed time. If their decreed time arrives, they cannot delay it, even by a small amount, and they cannot advance it."
"O sons of Adam, when apostles come to you from among you, who convey My messages, then those who take heed and amend will have neither fear nor regret.",34,7,يَٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ إِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتِى فَمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"O children of Adam, if messengers of your own come to you from Allah, reciting what Allah has revealed to them from His scripture, then follow them and what they bring. Those who are Mindful, following His instructions and staying away from what He has not allowed, making right what they do, there will be no fear upon them on the Day of Judgement, and they will not grieve about the pleasures that passed them by in this world."
"But those who deny Our signs and disdain them, shall belong to Hell, where they will abide for ever.",35,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ عَنْهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"As for the disbelievers, who reject Allah’s signs, and do not have faith in them, too proud to act in accordance with what their messengers bring to them, they are the companions of Hell, where they will live eternally."
"Who could be more wicked than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations? Such as these will receive what is declared in the Book, and when Our angels come to draw out their souls and ask: ""Where are they you worshipped other than God?"" They will answer: ""They have left us and fled;"" and bear witness against themselves for being infidels.",36,7,فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَٔايَٰتِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُم مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَالُوا۟ ضَلُّوا۟ عَنَّا وَشَهِدُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ كَٰفِرِينَ,"The greatest wrongdoer is the person who: invents a lie about Allah, considering Him to have a partner; or says He is deficient in some way; or says something about Him that He has not said; or rejects His clear signs and verses which guide to the correct way of life. Those who do such things will receive the portion of worldly pleasure that is destined for them in the Preserved Tablet, until the angel of death and his helpers come to them to take their souls, and they are asked: 'Where are the gods you used to worship besides Allah, claiming they would help you? Call on those idols if they can benefit you! The idolaters will say to the angels: 'The gods we used to worship have gone, and that we do not know where they are!' Then they will admit that they were disbelievers, but their admission at that time will be a proof against them and will not benefit them."
"""Enter then the Fire,"" will God say, ""with the past generations of jinns and men."" On entering each batch will condemn the other; and when all of them shall have entered one after the other, the last to come will say of those who had come before them: ""O our Lord, they are the ones who led us astray; so give them double chastisement in the Fire."" He will answer: ""For all it will be double; but this you do not know.""",37,7,قَالَ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ فِىٓ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ فِى ٱلنَّارِ كُلَّمَا دَخَلَتْ أُمَّةٌ لَّعَنَتْ أُخْتَهَا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا ٱدَّارَكُوا۟ فِيهَا جَمِيعًا قَالَتْ أُخْرَىٰهُمْ لِأُولَىٰهُمْ رَبَّنَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ أَضَلُّونَا فَـَٔاتِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ قَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تَعْلَمُونَ,"The angels will say: 'Enter you O idolaters the fire of Hell with the crowds of nations of jinn and people who passed away before you in disbelief and error!'. Whenever a nation enters Hell it condemns its sister nation which entered the fire of Hell before it, until they all reach one another and are gathered together. The last of them to enter, who are the lowly people and followers will ask concerning the previous nations who were their leaders and masters: 'O our Lord! These are the ones who led us astray from right guidance, so give them a double punishment, for that they beautified for us the path of misguidance.' Allah will reply to them: 'Each group of you will receive a doubled share of the punishment; but you will not perceive this.'"
"Then the former will say to the latter: ""You have no privilege over us. So taste the punishment for what you had done.""",38,7,وَقَالَتْ أُولَىٰهُمْ لِأُخْرَىٰهُمْ فَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ فَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,"The leaders and chiefs will exclaim: 'You do not have, O followers, over us any preference, therefore deserving any lightening of the punishment, as it is the result of your own actions. You do not have any excuse for having followed what was false. So taste then, O followers, the punishment just as we taste it, because of what you earned through your own disbelief and disobedience."
"Verily for those who deny Our signs and turn away in haughtiness from them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened, nor will they enter Paradise, not till the camel passes through the needle's eye. That is how We requite the transgressors:",39,7,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ عَنْهَا لَا تُفَتَّحُ لَهُمْ أَبْوَٰبُ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلَا يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ حَتَّىٰ يَلِجَ ٱلْجَمَلُ فِى سَمِّ ٱلْخِيَاطِ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Those who reject Allah’s clear signs and verses, and are too proud to follow them, have lost everything, because the gates of heaven will not open to their actions because of their disbelief; nor will they open for their souls when they die. Such people will never enter Paradise until the camel – one of the largest animals – goes into the eye of a needle – one of the smallest things. The aforementioned is impossible, and so is the idea that they will ever enter Paradise. In such a way does Allah reward those who stubbornly do wrong."
For them is a flooring of Hell and a covering (of fire). That is how We requite the iniquitous.,40,7,لَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"For these people who rejected the truth, because they were too proud, is a bed of Hell to lie on, and above them is a covering of torment. This is the way in which Allah rewards those who overstep His limits through their disbelief in Him, and through their turning away from Him."
"As for those who believe and do good, We never burden a soul beyond capacity. They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever.",41,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Yet those who have faith in their Lord and who do good actions to the best of their ability – and Allah does not burden a soul with more than it can bear – they are the companions of Paradise, entering into it and living there eternally."
"Whatever the rancour they may have in their hearts We shall (cleanse and) remove. Streams of running water shall ripple at their feet, and they will say: ""We are grateful to God for guiding us here. Never would we have been guided if God had not shown us the way. The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth."" And the cry shall resound: ""This is Paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds.""",42,7,وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِى صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَقَالُوا۟ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى هَدَىٰنَا لِهَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلَآ أَنْ هَدَىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَنُودُوٓا۟ أَن تِلْكُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةُ أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Their bliss in Paradise is made complete by Allah removing whatever hatred and resentment is in their hearts, with rivers running beneath them. When they come to live there and settle in their homes, they will exclaim whilst recognizing Allah’s blessings on them, praising Him: 'All praise and thanks belongs to Allah Who allowed us to do the good actions which brought us to this place, and we would not have been able to do that if Allah had not enabled us to do so. The messengers of our Lord came with the truth about which there was no doubt, true in its promises of good for the righteous and true in its threats for the wrongdoers. It will then be announced to them: 'This, truly this, is the Paradise which Allah has made you inherit out of His Mercy, for the good actions you used to do seeking the countenance of Allah.'"
"And the inmates of Paradise will call to the residents of Hell: ""We have found that the promise made to us by our Lord was true. Have you also found the promise of your Lord to be true?"" They will answer: ""Yes (it is so)."" Then a crier will call from among them: ""The curse of God be on the vile,",43,7,وَنَادَىٰٓ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ أَن قَدْ وَجَدْنَا مَا وَعَدَنَا رَبُّنَا حَقًّا فَهَلْ وَجَدتُّم مَّا وَعَدَ رَبُّكُمْ حَقًّا قَالُوا۟ نَعَمْ فَأَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌۢ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن لَّعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"The companions of Paradise will call the companions of Hell when they have all entered their places, saying: 'Indeed we have found what our Lord promised us about Paradise to be true, as we have entered into it. Have you found what Allah had promised you about Hell to be true?' The disbelievers will reply: 'We have found what was promised about Hell to be true.' Then a caller will proclaim that the wrongdoers be removed from Allah’s mercy, because the doors of His mercy were open to them and they turned away from them in their worldly life."
"""Who obstruct those who follow the path of God and try to make it oblique, who do not believe in the life to come.""",44,7,ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ كَٰفِرُونَ,"These wrongdoers used to themselves turn away from Allah’s religion, and used to turn others away from it, wanting to make the path of truth seem crooked so that people would not follow it. They also rejected the Afterlife, not believing in it, nor preparing for it."
"There will be a veil between them, and on the wall will be the men (of al-A'raf) who will recognise everyone by their distinguishing marks, and will call to the inmates of Paradise: ""Peace on you,"" without having entered it themselves though hoping to do so.",45,7,وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ وَعَلَى ٱلْأَعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ يَعْرِفُونَ كُلًّۢا بِسِيمَىٰهُمْ وَنَادَوْا۟ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَن سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ,"Between these two groups – the companions of Paradise and the companions of Hell – is a partition called ‘al-A‘rāf’, meaning ‘the Heights’. On this partition are people whose good and bad actions are equal. They know the companions of Paradise by their signs, such as the light on their faces, and the companions of Hell by their signs, such as the darkness on their faces. These people of the partition call the companions of Paradise, honouring them, saying, ‘Peace be upon you’. They do not enter Paradise yet, but they hope to enter it through Allah’s mercy."
"When their eyes fall on the inmates of Hell they will say: ""O Lord, do not place us in the crowd of the vile.""",46,7,وَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ تِلْقَآءَ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلنَّارِ قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,".When their eyes turn to the people who are the companions of Hell, and they see the severe punishment they are afflicted with, they pray: 'O our Lord! Do not put us with the wrongdoers, who disbelieved and worshipped others besides you!"
"Recognising them by their marks the men of al-A'raf will call (to the inmates of Hell): ""Of what use was your amassing (of wealth) of which you were proud?""",47,7,وَنَادَىٰٓ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْأَعْرَافِ رِجَالًا يَعْرِفُونَهُم بِسِيمَىٰهُمْ قَالُوا۟ مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"The companions of the Heights will call to people in Hell who had disbelieved, whom they recognize by their marks: ;It did not benefit you in the slightest when they used to gather together to prevent people from Allah’s path and arrogantly turn away from the truth.'"
"(Then pointing to the inmates of Paradise, they will say): ""Are they not those of whom you had sworn and said: 'God will not have mercy on them?' (And yet they have been told,) 'Enter Paradise where you will have no fear or regret.'""",48,7,أَهَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَقْسَمْتُمْ لَا يَنَالُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَآ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ,"Those who disbelieve will say concerning the believers: 'Are these faithful people those you swore Allah would not show mercy to?' Then these people who have faith will be told to enter Paradise, not fearing what awaits them, and not grieving over the pleasures of the world which passed them by, because of the eternal bliss they find themselves in."
"Those in Hell will call to the inmates of Paradise: ""Pour a little water over us, or give us a little of what God has given you."" They will answer: ""God has verily forbidden these to those who denied the truth.",49,7,وَنَادَىٰٓ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَنْ أَفِيضُوا۟ عَلَيْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ أَوْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The companions of Hell will call the companions of Paradise, begging them to pour some water or provide some of the food they have been given onto them. The companions of Paradise will tell them that Allah has forbidden both of these to the disbelievers, because of their disbelief, and that they will not help them in what Allah has forbidden for them."
"""Who made a sport and frolic of their faith and were lured by the life of the world."" As they had forgotten the meeting of this Day so shall We neglect them today for having rejected Our signs.",50,7,ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ لَهْوًا وَلَعِبًا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ نَنسَىٰهُمْ كَمَا نَسُوا۟ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَٰذَا وَمَا كَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,"These disbelievers are the ones who used to mock and make fun of faith and were deluded by the life of the world, being engrossed in its pleasures and luxuries. On the Day of Judgement, Allah will forget them, and they will be left to suffer the punishment because they forgot the meeting of the Day of Judgement which they neglected despite them having full knowledge of it. They rejected Allah’s signs and proofs in condemnation, despite knowing and recognizing the truth of His message."
"Indeed We had brought to them a Book distinct, replete with knowledge, and guidance and grace for men who believe.",51,7,وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَٰهُم بِكِتَٰبٍ فَصَّلْنَٰهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"And Allah has indeed sent them this Qur’ān, the Scripture revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), explaining it and clarifying all things with His Knowledge. It guides the believers to the right path and to the truth, and is a mercy for them because of what it guides them to, of goodness in this world and in the Afterlife."
"Are they waiting for the exposition of what it speaks of? The day that (Reality) is unravelled, the people who had lost sight of it will say: ""The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth. Do we have any one to intercede for us? If only we could go back to the world, we would act otherwise."" Indeed they have caused themselves harm, and the lies they concocted did not help.",52,7,هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا تَأْوِيلَهُۥ يَوْمَ يَأْتِى تَأْوِيلُهُۥ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ نَسُوهُ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ فَهَل لَّنَا مِن شُفَعَآءَ فَيَشْفَعُوا۟ لَنَآ أَوْ نُرَدُّ فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ قَدْ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"Those who disbelieve in reality only wait for what they have been warned: a painful punishment in the Afterlife as a result of their actions. The believers were also foretold about the reward of that day. Those who ignored the Qur’ān in the life of this world, not acting according to what is in it, will then say: 'Indeed the messengers of our Lord came with the truth, in which there was no doubt. If only there was a mediator who could now plead on our behalf so we could be excused from the punishment. Or if only we could return to the life of the world to do good actions that would save us instead of the bad we committed!' The disbelievers have lost themselves, gaining their own ruin because of their disbelief. Those who they used to worship beside Allah have abandoned them, and can be of no help to them."
"Surely your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans of time, then assumed all power. He covers up the day with night which comes chasing it fast; and the sun and moon and the stars are subject to His command. It is His to create and enjoin. Blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.",53,7,إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى ٱلَّيْلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُۥ حَثِيثًا وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ وَٱلنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَٰتٍۭ بِأَمْرِهِۦٓ أَلَا لَهُ ٱلْخَلْقُ وَٱلْأَمْرُ تَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O people, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, with no precedent. He established Himself on the Throne in a way befitting His Majesty. He made the darkness of the night disappear into the light of the day and the light of the day into the darkness of night, both chasing each other quickly so that neither is delayed. He also created the sun, the moon and the stars all subservient under His dominion. Is the whole of creation not His? Who besides Him is creator? His alone is the command. He is High above any flaw. He is described with the attributes of splendour and perfection- the Lord of the Worlds."
Pray to your Lord in humility and unseen. He does not love the iniquitous.,54,7,ٱدْعُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"O believers, call on your Lord with complete humility, silently and in private, sincere in your prayer, not showing off, and not worshipping others along with Allah in your prayers. He does not love those who overstep the limits in their prayers; and one of the worst ways someone can do this is by invoking others besides Him, as the idolaters do."
And do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed; and pray to Him in awe and expectation. The blessing of God is at hand for those who do good.,55,7,وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَٰحِهَا وَٱدْعُوهُ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Do not ruin things on earth by committing sins after Allah has put it right by sending the messengers (peace be upon them) and establishing things in accordance with His laws. Call on Allah alone, fearing His punishment and hoping for His reward. The mercy of Allah is truly close to those who do good, so be from among them."
"Indeed it is He who sends the winds as harbingers of auspicious news announcing His beneficence, bringing heavy clouds which We drive towards a region lying dead, and send down rain, and raise all kinds of fruits. So shall We raise the dead that you may think and reflect.",56,7,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ بُشْرًۢا بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِۦ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَقَلَّتْ سَحَابًا ثِقَالًا سُقْنَٰهُ لِبَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ فَأَنزَلْنَا بِهِ ٱلْمَآءَ فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِۦ مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ كَذَٰلِكَ نُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"It is Allah who sends the winds as good news of coming rain, until when they carry a cloud heavy with water He drives the cloud to a barren land and sends down rain on it, bringing out all kinds of fruits and crops. The way that this vegetation is brought out is similar to the way the dead will be brought out of the graves and back to life. This is, O people, so that perhaps you will then reflect on the power of Allah and the wonder of His creation, and that He is able to bring the dead to life."
"The soil that is good produces (rich) crops by the will of its Lord, and that which is had yields only what is poor. So do We explain Our signs in different ways to people who give thanks.",57,7,وَٱلْبَلَدُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ يَخْرُجُ نَبَاتُهُۥ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِۦ وَٱلَّذِى خَبُثَ لَا يَخْرُجُ إِلَّا نَكِدًا كَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَشْكُرُونَ,"Good land produces vegetation in abundance, by Allah’s permission. Likewise, the believer understands the teachings they are given and they benefit from them, acting accordingly with righteousness. On the other hand, the rotten, salty land only produces vegetation in small amounts, and there is little goodness in what it produces. Likewise, the disbeliever will not benefit from the true teachings they receive, and will not perform good actions that benefit him. Through such variation Allah reveals His signs and proofs in different ways, to confirm the truth to a people who are thankful for Allah’s blessings, who do not disbelieve them, and who follow their Lord."
"We sent Noah to his people, and he said: ""O people worship God; you have no other god but He; for I fear the retribution of the great Day may fall on you.""",58,7,لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ فَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"Indeed I sent Noah as a messenger to his people calling them to the Oneness of Allah and to leave off worshipping anything besides Him. Noah said to them: 'O people! Worship Allah alone, you have no true God except Him. I fear for you O people, the punishment of a great day if you persist in your disbelief.'"
"The elders of his people replied: ""We see clearly that you have gone astray.""",59,7,قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّا لَنَرَىٰكَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,The leaders and notables among his people said: 'O Noah! Indeed we think you are in clear error.
"""I have not gone astray, O my people,"" he said, ""but have been sent by my Lord, the creator of all the worlds.",60,7,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِى ضَلَٰلَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّى رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Noah told the leaders of his people: 'I am not in error, as you claim, but rather I am on guidance from my Lord, and I am a messenger from Him who is my Lord, your Lord, and the Lord of all creations.'"
"I bring to you the messages of my Lord, and give you sincere advice, for I know from God what you do not know.",61,7,أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَٰلَٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"'I only convey to you the revelation Allah has sent me with. I only want what is good for you when I encourage you to follow what Allah instructed and to receive the reward for doing so, and warn you from what Allah has prohibited and the punishment you would receive for disobeying Him. And I know from Allah may He be Exalted what you do not know, because of the knowledge Allah has given to me through revelation. '"
"Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you, and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear God? You might be treated with mercy.""",62,7,أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ وَلِتَتَّقُوا۟ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"' Do you find it strange O people, that revelation and good teaching has come to you from your Lord on the tongue of a man from amongt yourselves whom you know well?! I have grown up amongst you and I have never been a liar or misguided, nor have I come to you from another people. I have come to warn you about the punishment of Allah so that you might follow His instructions and stay away from what He has prohibited hoping that then you would receive Mercy through having faith in Him.'"
"But they called him a liar, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned the others who rejected Our signs, for they were a people purblind.",63,7,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا عَمِينَ,"However, Noah’s people rejected him, and did not have faith in Allah, but continued in their disbelief. Noah at last asked Allah to destroy the disbelievers. Allah saved Noah and those who were with him and who had faith from drowning, by enabling them to retreat in the Ark. He destroyed those who rejected His signs, and who continued rejecting them, drowning them in a great flood as their punishment. Indeed they were a people whose hearts were blind to the truth."
"And We sent Hud, their brother, to the people of 'Ad. He said: ""O you people, worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed for yourselves?""",64,7,وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُودًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"And I sent to the people of ‘Ād a messenger whose name was Hūd (peace be upon him). Hūd said to them: 'O people! Worship Allah alone, for you have no true God except Him, will you not then be mindful of Him by following His instructions and staying away from what He has prohibited, so that you would be saved from His punishment?'"
"The chiefs of his people who were infidels replied: ""We find you full of folly, and a liar to boot.""",65,7,قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّا لَنَرَىٰكَ فِى سَفَاهَةٍ وَإِنَّا لَنَظُنُّكَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"The leaders and notables among his people who disbelieved in Allah and rejected His messenger said: Indeed we only think you O Hūd as someone foolish and backward, calling us to worship Allah alone, and to leave the worship of our idols. In fact we are certain that you are a liar in claiming that you have been sent by Allah!'"
"""I am not a fool, O people,"" he answered, ""but have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds.",66,7,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِى سَفَاهَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّى رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Hūd replied: “O my people I am not foolish or backward, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.”"
I bring to you the messages of my Lord. I am your sincere friend.,67,7,أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَٰلَٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنَا۠ لَكُمْ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ,"' I am only conveying what Allah had instructed me to deliver to you, that you belief in Allah’s Oneness and His sacred law. I am to you all a trustworthy adviser, delivering what I am instructed, no less or more.'"
"Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you and warns you? Remember, He made you leaders after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed.""",68,7,أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ وَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى ٱلْخَلْقِ بَصْۜطَةً فَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ ءَالَآءَ ٱللَّهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"'Is it strange and amazing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord from a man amongst you and from your likeness, not through an angel or a jinn. Thank Allah and praise Him for having established you on the earth making you successors to the people of Noah who were destroyed because of their disbelief. Thank Allah for having favoured you by making you strong in stature, and remember Allah’s great blessings on you so that you may be succesful, attaining what you desire and avoiding what is feared.'"
"They answered: ""Have you come to say to us that we should worship only one God, abandoning those our ancestors had worshipped? If so, bring on us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true.""",69,7,قَالُوٓا۟ أَجِئْتَنَا لِنَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ وَحْدَهُۥ وَنَذَرَ مَا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,Hūd’s people said: 'Have you come to tell us to worship Allah alone and to leave what our parents and ancestors worshipped! Bring us the punishment you promise if you are telling the truth in what you claim.'
"He replied: ""You have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of God. Why dispute with me about names invented by you and your ancestors for which no sanction was sent down? So wait (for what is to come), I am waiting with you.""",70,7,قَالَ قَدْ وَقَعَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ رِجْسٌ وَغَضَبٌ أَتُجَٰدِلُونَنِى فِىٓ أَسْمَآءٍ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُم مَّا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَٰنٍ فَٱنتَظِرُوٓا۟ إِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُنتَظِرِينَ,"Hūd said: 'Already the punishment of Allah and His Anger is on its way! Do you argue with me about idols you and your fathers have called gods, when they have no basis, since Allah has sent down no proof of their divinity. Wait then for the punishment you ask for, for I am also waiting, for indeed it is on its way.'"
"Then We saved him and those on his side by Our grace, and destroyed to the very last those who rejected Our signs and denied the truth.",71,7,فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَقَطَعْنَا دَابِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"So Allah saved Hūd (peace be upon him), and those of the believers who were with him, through a mercy from Him, and He removed and destroyed those who rejected His signs, who did not have faith and deserved their punishment because of their denial."
"We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh. ""O you people,"" said he, ""worship God, for you have no other god but He. Clear proof has come to you already from your Lord, and this she-camel of God is the token for you. Leave her free to graze upon God's earth, and do not molest her lest a grievous punishment should befall you.",72,7,وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَٰلِحًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ هَٰذِهِۦ نَاقَةُ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ ءَايَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِىٓ أَرْضِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوٓءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah sent to the tribe of Thamūd their brother Ṣāliḥ, to call them to belief in the Oneness of Allah and to worship Him alone. Ṣāliḥ said: 'O People! Believe in Allah alone, you have no other God worthy of being worshipped. I have come to you with a sign proving the truth of what I have brought you: namely a camel which will come out of a rock. It has an allocated time to drink from the water, and for you a seperate time to drink. Allow her to eat within Allah’s land and do not harm her in any way, or a painful punishment would befall you.'"
"Remember, how you were made leaders after the people of 'Ad, and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plains palaces, and carve dwellings out of mountains. So think of the favours of God, and do not act with corruption in the land.""",73,7,وَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ عَادٍ وَبَوَّأَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِن سُهُولِهَا قُصُورًا وَتَنْحِتُونَ ٱلْجِبَالَ بُيُوتًا فَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ ءَالَآءَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"'Praise Allah for making you representatives on the earth after the destruction of the people of ‘Ād who had persevered in disbelief, and thank Him for establishing you in the land so that you could enjoy it and satisfy your desires. You build palaces in the plains and carve houses for yourselves out of the mountains. Remember Allah’s blessings upon you and thank Him for them, and do not to put your efforts into causing corruption on earth and leave off your disbelief in Allah and your disobedience to Him."
"The chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed, asked: ""Do you really know that Saleh has been sent by his Lord?"" They said: ""Indeed we believe in the message he has brought.""",74,7,قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟ لِمَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُمْ أَتَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ صَٰلِحًا مُّرْسَلٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلَ بِهِۦ مُؤْمِنُونَ,"The leaders and important people, who looked down in pride at the people who had faith, those they considered to be weak, asked them: 'Do you really know that Ṣāliḥ is a messenger from Allah?' The believers replied: 'We have sure faith in him, and we act in agreement with what he has brought us.'"
"Those who were arrogant answered: ""We do not believe in what you believe.""",75,7,قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا بِٱلَّذِىٓ ءَامَنتُم بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"The arrogant among his people said: 'Indeed we dibelieve in what you have faith in, O believers, and we will not have faith in it nor act in agreement with its sacred laws.'"
"Then they hamstrung the she-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and said: ""Bring, O Saleh, on us the affliction you promise, if you are one of the sent ones.""",76,7,فَعَقَرُوا۟ ٱلنَّاقَةَ وَعَتَوْا۟ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ وَقَالُوا۟ يَٰصَٰلِحُ ٱئْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"So they killed the camel which they had been forbidden to harmfully touch, too proud to follow Allah’s command. Doubting what Ṣāliḥ had promised would happen, they mocked him saying: 'O Salih! Bring the painful punishment you have told us would afflict us, If you really are a messenger from Allah!'"
"Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.",77,7,فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ فِى دَارِهِمْ جَٰثِمِينَ,"When the punishment the disbelievers had asked for arrived, and they were taken by a great earthquake, so that in the morning they lay fallen, their faces and knees on the earth, none of them escaping from the destruction."
"Saleh turned away from them and said: ""O my people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and warned you; but you do not like those who wish you well.""",78,7,فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَةَ رَبِّى وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تُحِبُّونَ ٱلنَّٰصِحِينَ,"Ṣāliḥ (peace be upon him) turned away from his people, having given up all hope for them. He said: 'O people, I had delivered what Allah had instructed me to deliver to you, and had advised you well, encouraging and warning you, but you were a people who did not have any love for sincere advisers who wanted to lead you to goodness and distance you from evil."
"And We sent Lot, who said to his people: ""Why do you commit this lecherous act which none in the world has committed before?",79,7,وَلُوطًا إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِۦٓ أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُم بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Allah sent Lot to his people to call them to belief in the Oneness of Allah and to stop them from rebelling against Him. He said: 'Do you commit such a forbidden and shameful act as sodomy, when no one before you has committed such a crime!'"
"In preference to women you satisfy your lust with men. Indeed you are a people who are guilty of excess.""",80,7,إِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ,"'Do you go to men to satisfy your lust instead of women, who you were supposed to go to?! Then in that case you have not followed sense or any sound report or even what is natural! Rather you have gone beyond the limits of Allah, overstepping the bounds of moderation, good sense and the natural nobility of humankind."
"His people made no answer, and only said: ""Drive them out of the city. They profess to be pure.""",81,7,وَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوٓا۟ أَخْرِجُوهُم مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ,"His people, who committed this shameless wrong which they had been forbidden from doing, only responded by turning away from the truth, saying: 'Drive Lot and his followers out of your city. They are a people who have kept away from this action of ours, so it is not befitting that they stay living here among us.'"
"But We saved him and his family, except for his wife who was one of those who stayed behind.",82,7,فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱمْرَأَتَهُۥ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"So Allah saved Lot and his family by instructing them to leave the city by night. His family were saved except for his wife, who remained behind in the city and suffered the same punishment as the rest."
And We rained down on them a shower (of Stones). So witness the end of sinners!,83,7,وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَرًا فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Allah brought down upon them a great rain of rocks of baked clay, overturning the city and turning it upside down. So consider what the end of the sinful people of Lot was. Their end was ruin and eternal disgrace."
"Remember, We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib. ""O you people,"" he said, ""worship God, for you have no other god but He. Clear proof has come to you from your Lord; so give in full measure and full weight; do not keep back from people what is theirs, and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed. This is best for you if you believe.",84,7,وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَوْفُوا۟ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا۟ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَٰحِهَا ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"To the tribe of Midian Allah sent their brother Shu‘ayb (peace be upon him). He said: 'O people! Worship Allah alone for you have no God worthy of worship other than Him. A clear proof from Allah has come to you confirming what I bring to you from your Lord is the truth. Give people their rights, by measuring and weighing things correctly, not short-changing people by saying bad things about their goods, or by cheating them, and do not to cause corruption on earth through disbelief and disobedience after things have been set right through the sending of prophets. All of this is better for you and more beneficial if you are believers, because then you would leave disobedience, and draw close to Allah by doing what He has commanded.'"
"Do not lie in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of God those who believe in Him, nor seek obliquity in it. Remember the day when you were few and He increased your numbers. So consider the fate of those who were evil.",85,7,وَلَا تَقْعُدُوا۟ بِكُلِّ صِرَٰطٍ تُوعِدُونَ وَتَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِۦ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ إِذْ كُنتُمْ قَلِيلًا فَكَثَّرَكُمْ وَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"'Do not sit in wait on every road, threatening the people travelling there in order to steal their possessions, and preventing those who want to be guided from the path of Allah, wanting the path of Allah to be crooked so that people would not follow it. Remember the blessings of Allah upon you so that you might be thankful, for you had been few in the land and He increased your numbers. Reflect on what had been the end of those who caused corruption in the earth before you, since their end had been destruction and ruin!'"
"If some of you believe what has been sent through me, and some of you do not, have patience until God decide between us, for He is the best of all judges.""",86,7,وَإِن كَانَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنكُمْ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِۦ وَطَآئِفَةٌ لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُوا۟ فَٱصْبِرُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَنَا وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَٰكِمِينَ,"'And if there is a group among you who believe in what I have brought from my Lord, and another group who did not believe in it, then you, O deniers, should wait to see how Allah judges between the two groups. It would then become clear who stood for the truth and who were liars; and that those who stand for the truth will be saved, while those who are liars will be destroyed.'"
"The arrogant leaders of the people replied: ""We shall drive you away from our land, O Shu'aib, and those who are with you, unless you come back to your faith."" But he remarked: ""Even if we are disgusted with it?",87,7,قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يَٰشُعَيْبُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِى مِلَّتِنَا قَالَ أَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَٰرِهِينَ,"The leaders and important people who were proud among the people of Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) said: 'We will drive you out of our city O Shu'ayb, you and those with you who believe you, unless you and they return back to your old way of life and worship. Shu‘ayb said in astonishment: 'Should we return to a way of life and religion that we hate because we know what falsehood it is based on?!'"
"We shall only be guilty of blaspheming God if we accept your way after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed.""",88,7,قَدِ ٱفْتَرَيْنَا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا إِنْ عُدْنَا فِى مِلَّتِكُم بَعْدَ إِذْ نَجَّىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَآ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّنَا وَسِعَ رَبُّنَا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا ٱفْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْفَٰتِحِينَ,"'If we follow what you believe of disbelief and polytheism after we have been saved from it by Allah’s grace, we would have invented a lie against Him. It would not be appropriate or right for us to return to your false religion unless Allah wills us to do so – as we will do whatever He wills. Allah surrounds everything in knowledge, and so He knows what is right for His slaves. Nothing is hidden from Him. We put our trust in Allah alone, so He will make us firm on the right path and protect us from the ways leading to Hell. O our Lord! Judge between us and these disbelieving people with the truth, and help those who hold to the truth and those who are wronged against those who are wrongdoers. You O Lord are the best of Judges.'."
"The chiefs among his people who did not believe said (to them): ""If you follow Shu'aib and his way you will surely be ruined.""",89,7,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ لَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتُمْ شُعَيْبًا إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا لَّخَٰسِرُونَ,"The important people and leaders of his people who refused the call to believe in the Oneness of Allah, warned people against Shu’ayb and his faith, saying: 'O people, if you follow Shu’ayb’s path, leaving the way of life of our ancestors, you would certainly find ruin through doing so.'"
"Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.",90,7,فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ فِى دَارِهِمْ جَٰثِمِينَ,"So a great earthquake took them; and in the morning they were dead in their homes, fallen on their knees and faces."
They who called Shu'aib a liar (disappeared) as though they had never existed; and those who called Shu'aib a liar were the ones who were ruined!,91,7,ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ شُعَيْبًا كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْا۟ فِيهَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ شُعَيْبًا كَانُوا۟ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Those who rejected Shu’ayb were all destroyed, and it was as if they had never lived in their homes or found enjoyment there.Those who rejected Shu’ayb were the losers, losing themselves and their possessions, whereas those who had faith did not fail in the least, contrary to what those who disbelieved claimed."
"So Shu'aib turned away from them and said: ""O people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and warned you. (But you paid no heed). How can I grieve for a people who do not believe?""",92,7,فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَٰلَٰتِ رَبِّى وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ فَكَيْفَ ءَاسَىٰ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ كَٰفِرِينَ,"Then their prophet Shu‘ayb (peace be upon him) turned from them when they were destroyed saying: 'O people! Indeed I had delivered what my Lord had instructed me to deliver to you, and I had given you good advice; but you had not taken my advice, nor followed my guidance, so how then can I grieve for a people who disbelieved in Allah and insisted on disbelief?'"
There is not a region to which We sent a prophet and did not inflict upon its people adversity and hardship so that they may submit.,93,7,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّبِىٍّ إِلَّآ أَخَذْنَآ أَهْلَهَا بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَضَّرَّعُونَ,"God did not send a prophet to any city, the people of which denied and rejected the truth, except that He tried them with suffering and poverty and illness so that they might humble themselves before God, and leave their pride and disbelief. This was a warning for Quraysh and for all peoples who disbelieve and reject the way of God."
"But when We changed hardship to ease, and they rose and prospered, (they forgot Our favours) and said: ""Our ancestors had also known suffering and joy."" So We caught them unawares.",94,7,ثُمَّ بَدَّلْنَا مَكَانَ ٱلسَّيِّئَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةَ حَتَّىٰ عَفَوا۟ وَّقَالُوا۟ قَدْ مَسَّ ءَابَآءَنَا ٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَٱلسَّرَّآءُ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"After trying them with suffering and illness Allah improved their situation and turned their suffering into well-being and safety, until they became many and their wealth increased, and they said that the bad and good that they had experienced was a normal part of life and that the same thing had happened to their ancestors before them. They did not recognise that there was a lesson to be learned in the difficulties that occurred to them and that there was a test for them in the good that they were given. Then Allah overtook them suddenly with the punishment, while they were unaware of it and did not expect it."
"But if the people of these regions had believed and feared God, We would surely have showered on them blessings of the heavens and the earth; but they only denied, and We punished them for their deeds.",95,7,وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱتَّقَوْا۟ لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبُوا۟ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"If the people of the towns and cities which Allah sent His messengers to had believed in what their messengers brought them, and had been mindful of their Lord, leaving their disbelief and disobedience and following His commands, then Allah would have opened the doors of goodness upon them in every way; but they did not believe and were not mindful of Him. Instead they rejected what their prophets came with. So Allah overtook them with the punishment suddenly because of what they had earned through their sins and disobedience."
Are the people of the region so secure that they lie asleep unaware as Our punishment overtakes them?,96,7,أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا بَيَٰتًا وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ,So do the people who reject the truth in these cities feel safe from the punishment of Allah overcoming them in the night while they are sleeping?
"Or, are the people of the towns so unafraid that (even when) Our retribution comes upon them in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play?",97,7,أَوَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,"Or do they feel safe from the punishment of Allah overcoming them during the day, mid- morning, while they are amusing themselves forgetfully, busy with the life of this world?"
Can they remain secure against the plan of God? Only they feel secure against the plan of God who are certain of being ruined.,98,7,أَفَأَمِنُوا۟ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Look at the blessings Allah has given them of strength and abundance, how He gave them as a means of testing them. Do these people who reject the truth among the people of these cities feel safe from Allah’s plan and His faultless arrangement of things? No one feels safe from Allah’s plan except a people who are lost. Yet those who are successful fear His Planning. They do not become amazed and proud because of what Allah has given to them, but rather see His Generosity to them and are thankful to Him."
"Do not the people who inherited the earth from the (earlier) inhabitants perceive that We could afflict them too for their sins if We pleased, and put seals on their hearts that they may not hear (the voice of truth)?",99,7,أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لِلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ ٱلْأَرْضَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَهْلِهَآ أَن لَّوْ نَشَآءُ أَصَبْنَٰهُم بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَنَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ,"Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after the peoples before them were destroyed because of their sins – a people that they do not learn from, but actually copy in behaviour – that if Allah wanted to overcome them for their disobedience He would do so, as He often does, sealing their hearts so that they do not listen to the lesson and are not benefitted by being reminding of such a warning?"
"These were the (earlier) habitations whose accounts We have given to you. Their apostles came with clear proofs, but they did not believe what they once denied. That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not believe.",100,7,تِلْكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآئِهَا وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانُوا۟ لِيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِمَا كَذَّبُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ كَذَٰلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"These previous nations, of the peoples of Noah, Hūd, Sāliḥ, Lot and Shu’ayb- I relate their narrative to you O Messenger, concerning their rejection of the truth and their stubbornness, and the destruction that befell them, to serve as an example for those who reflect, and a warning for those who take advice. Messengers came to the people of these cities with clear signs of the truth of what they brought, but Allah did not guide them to the truth because of their rejection of it the first time, a just recompense for their rejection despite seeing the clear signs and proofs. In the same way that Allah closed the hearts of the peoples of these cities who rejected their prophets, Allah closes the hearts of those who reject Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him), so that they are not guided to faith. In the same way that God sealed the hearts of the peoples of these towns which rejected their prophets, God seals the hearts of those who reject Muhammad, blessings and peace be upon him, so that they are not guided to faith."
"We did not find many of them faithful to their promises, and found many of them disobedient.",101,7,وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ وَإِن وَجَدْنَآ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَٰسِقِينَ,Allah did not find most of the peoples who were sent messengers to be firm and constant in what He commanded – most of them rebelling against Him.
"So We sent Moses with miracles after (these apostles) to the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they behaved with them high-handedly. See then the end of the authors of evil.",102,7,ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِم مُّوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦ فَظَلَمُوا۟ بِهَا فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"Then Allah sent the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), after these messengers, to Pharaoh and his people with clear miracles showing the truth of what he came with. Yet they only rejected these miracles and disbelieved them. So reflect on what the end of Pharaoh and his people was as a result of their rejection: Allah destroyed them by drowning them, condemning them in this world and in the Afterlife."
"Moses said: ""O Pharaoh, I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds;",103,7,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يَٰفِرْعَوْنُ إِنِّى رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"And Moses said when Allah sent him to Pharaoh: 'O Pharaoh! I have been sent from the Creator of all creation, the Owner and Sustainer of everything.'"
"""I am duty bound to speak nothing of God but the truth I have brought from your Lord a clear sign; so let the people of Israel depart with me.""",104,7,حَقِيقٌ عَلَىٰٓ أَن لَّآ أَقُولَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلْحَقَّ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِبَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعِىَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"Moses said: 'Since I have been sent from Allah it is only appropriate for me to say the truth about Him. I have brought you a clear proof showing the truth of what I say, proving that I am sent from Allah to you. Release the Children of Israel from the slavery and miserable treatment they have suffered and let them leave with me.'"
"He said: ""If you have brought a sign then display it, if what you say is true.""",105,7,قَالَ إِن كُنتَ جِئْتَ بِـَٔايَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Pharaoh said: 'If you have brought a sign, as you claim, then show it to me, if you are telling the truth."
"At this Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it became a live serpent.",106,7,فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,"So Moses threw his stick and it changed into a great snake, clear for all to see."
"And he drew forth his hand, and behold, it looked white to those who beheld it.",107,7,وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُۥ فَإِذَا هِىَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّٰظِرِينَ,"Then he drew out his hand from his shirt, near to his chest or under his arm, and it appeared completely white, not because of illness, but radiating brilliantly to all who saw it because of its extreme whiteness."
"The nobles of Pharaoh said: ""He surely is a clever magician.",108,7,قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسَٰحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,The notables and leaders said once they witnessed the transformation of the stick and the whiteness of his hand: 'Moses is nothing but a skilled and masterful magician.'
"""He wishes to drive you away from the land. So what do you advise?""",109,7,يُرِيدُ أَن يُخْرِجَكُم مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ,'He intends by this to drive you all out from Egypt through his magic.' So Pharaoh asked his chiefs what they advise him to do.
"They said: ""Put him and his brother off (awhile) and send out heralds to the cities",110,7,قَالُوٓا۟ أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَأَرْسِلْ فِى ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَٰشِرِينَ,"They said: 'Delay their case, Moses and his brother Aaron, and send people to the cities of Egypt to call all the magicians.'"
"""To bring all the wise magicians to you.""",111,7,يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَٰحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ,'They will bring to you every skillful and powerful magician.'
"The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said: ""Is there reward for us if we succeed?""",112,7,وَجَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَٰلِبِينَ,"So Pharaoh sent people to call the magicians, and when they came to Pharaoh they asked him if they would have a reward if they were the winners and overcame Moses with their magic."
"""Yes,"" said he, ""you will be among the honoured.""",113,7,قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,Pharaoh replied: 'Yes Indeed! You will be given a reward and you would be brought near to me and of those given important positions.'
"So they said: ""O Moses, you may cast your spell first, or we shall cast ours.""",114,7,قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ نَحْنُ ٱلْمُلْقِينَ,"Due to their pride, they were certain that they would win against Moses. They asked him: 'Choose O Moses if you want to be the first to throw, or if you want us to throw first.'"
"""You cast it first,"" answered Moses. When they cast their spell, they bewitched the eyes of the people and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm.",115,7,قَالَ أَلْقُوا۟ فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَوْا۟ سَحَرُوٓا۟ أَعْيُنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ,"Trusting in Allah that he would overcome them, Moses was not worried about them. He told them to throw their ropes and sticks. When they threw them they cast a mighty spell over the eyes of the people watching the spectacle, so that things looked different to reality, and the people became awed and frightened."
"We said to Moses: ""Throw down your staff;"" and it swallowed up their conjurations in no time.",116,7,وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,Allah then inspired Prophet Moses (peace be upon him): 'Throw your stick O Moses!' So he threw it and the stick changed into a snake and swallowed the ropes and sticks the magicians were using instead of real snakes; destroying for the people the illusion that these were crawling snakes.
"Thus the truth was upheld, and the falsehood that they practised was exposed.",117,7,فَوَقَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"In this way the truth became clear: proving the truth of what Moses was saying, and showing the falsehood of what the magicians had done."
"Thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown, humiliated.",118,7,فَغُلِبُوا۟ هُنَالِكَ وَٱنقَلَبُوا۟ صَٰغِرِينَ,The magicians were defeated and humiliated by Moses in the assembly.
"The sorcerers fell to the ground in homage,",119,7,وَأُلْقِىَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَٰجِدِينَ,"When the magicians saw the greatness of the power of Allah, and his clear signs, they could only fall down, prostrating to Him."
"And said: ""We have come to believe in the Lord of all the worlds,",120,7,قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,The magicians exclaimed: 'We believe in the Lord of all of creation.'
"""The Lord of Moses and Aaron.""",121,7,رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ,"He is the Lord of Moses and Aaron (peace be upon them), alone worthy of worship for all people, and the false gods are not worthy of worship."
"But Pharaoh said: ""You have come to accept belief in Him without my permission! This surely is a plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land. You will soon come to know.",122,7,قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ءَامَنتُم بِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لِتُخْرِجُوا۟ مِنْهَآ أَهْلَهَا فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Pharaoh said threatening them because of their faith in Allah: 'Do you believe in Allah before I have given you permission to do so. This is only a trick you were deceiving people with, and a plot that you and Moses have planned to drive out the people of the city. But soon you will know what the consequences are and what an example I will make of you!'"
"""I will have your hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, and have you all crucified.""",123,7,لَأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُم مِّنْ خِلَٰفٍ ثُمَّ لَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"'I will cut off the right hand and left foot or the left hand and right foot of each of you, and would then crucify you on palm trunks, making an example of you to frighten whoever sees you.'"
"They answered: ""We have (in any case) to go back to our Lord.",124,7,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,"The magicians replied: 'Indeed we will return to our Lord alone, so we are not scared of what you threaten us with.'"
"""The only reason you have to hate us is that we believed in the signs of our Lord as they came to us. O our Lord, give us sufficient endurance that we may die submitting (to You).""",125,7,وَمَا تَنقِمُ مِنَّآ إِلَّآ أَنْ ءَامَنَّا بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّنَا لَمَّا جَآءَتْنَا رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَتَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ,"'You are only finding fault in us because we had faith in the signs of our Lord when they came to us through Moses. If this is our crime, then we stand firmly by it.' Then they turned to Allah in prayer: 'O our Lord! Pour upon us patience so that we will be able to stand firmly for the truth and let us die in a state of surrendering in devotion to You, doing as You command, and following Your Messenger.'"
"And the leaders of Pharaoh's people said to him: ""Would you allow Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and discard you and your gods?"" He replied: ""We shall now slay their sons and spare their women, and subdue them.""",126,7,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ,"The leaders and notables people among Pharaoh’s people urged Pharaoh, provoking him to act against Moses and the believers who were with him. They said: 'Will you leave Moses and his people to spread corruption in the land, abandoning you and your gods, and calling to the worship of Allah alone?' Pharaoh said: 'We will kill the sons of the Children of Israel, and let their women live to serve us, and we have complete power over them.'"
"Said Moses to his people: ""Invoke the help of God and be firm. The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves.""",127,7,قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱصْبِرُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱلْأَرْضَ لِلَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَٱلْعَٰقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Moses advised his people: 'O people, ask for the help of Allah alone to remove hardship from you and to bring good, and be patient with the trial we have being given. For indeed the earth belongs to Allah alone, and it does not belong to Pharaoh or anyone else to do as they please in it. Rather, Allah, according to His will, gives turns to different people to have authority in the land, but the good end on earth is for those who have faith, follow the commands of their Lord and stay away from what He has prohibited – they will achieve the good end despite the tests and trials they are given.'"
"They said: ""We were oppressed before you came, and have been since you have come to us."" He answered: ""It may well be that soon God may destroy your enemy and make you inherit the land, and then see how you behave.""",128,7,قَالُوٓا۟ أُوذِينَا مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَأْتِيَنَا وَمِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ,"The Children of Israel said to Moses (peace be upon him): 'We suffered at the hands of Pharaoh before you came to us and after you have come, with Pharaoh killing our sons and letting our women live.' Moses (peace be upon him) advised them giving them hope of release from their trial: 'It may be that Allah might destroy your enemy, Pharaoh and his people, and establish you on the earth after them, seeing whether you behave with thankfulness or ingratitude.'"
We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed.,129,7,وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَآ ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ بِٱلسِّنِينَ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"And indeed I gave the people of Pharaoh a number of years of drought and famine, testing them with a shortage of fruits and crops, so that they might reflect and realise that this was a punishment from Allah because of their disbelief, and so they might repent to Him."
"Yet when good came their way they said: ""It is our due;"" but when misfortune befell them they put the omen down to Moses and those who were with him. But surely the omen was with God, yet most of them did not understand.",130,7,فَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْحَسَنَةُ قَالُوا۟ لَنَا هَٰذِهِۦ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَطَّيَّرُوا۟ بِمُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُۥٓ أَلَآ إِنَّمَا طَٰٓئِرُهُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Whenever the people of Pharaoh experienced wealth, healthy yields, and a thriving economy, they said: 'We have been given this because we deserve it.' But if a misfortune came upon them, such as a drought or famine, diseases, and other hardships, they would blame their bad fortune on Moses and the Children of Israel who were with him. However, the misfortunes happened to them by the decree and permission of Allah, and neither they nor Moses (peace be upon him) had any part in the affair, apart from Moses's supplications against them. But most of them do not know, saying what happens is due to other things, rather than Allah’s decree."
"They said: ""Whatsoever the sign you have brought to deceive us, we shall not believe in you.""",131,7,وَقَالُوا۟ مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِۦ مِنْ ءَايَةٍ لِّتَسْحَرَنَا بِهَا فَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The people of Pharaoh said to Moses (peace be upon them), out of their stubbornness against the truth: 'Whatever sign or evidence you bring to us and whatever proof of the falsehood of own beliefs you show us, we will not believe you. '"
"So We let loose on them floods and locusts, and vermin, frogs and blood -- how many different signs. But they still remained arrogant, for they were a people full of sin.",132,7,فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلطُّوفَانَ وَٱلْجَرَادَ وَٱلْقُمَّلَ وَٱلضَّفَادِعَ وَٱلدَّمَ ءَايَٰتٍ مُّفَصَّلَٰتٍ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا مُّجْرِمِينَ,"As a punishment for their rejection and stubbornness, I sent floods of water that destroyed their crops and fruits; locusts and weevils that ate their crops and harvests;frogs which filled their dishes and containers, ruining their food, and disturbing their sleep; and turning the water in their wells and rivers into blood. All these were sent as clear and distinct signs, one after another. Despite all of these torments, they were too proud to have faith in Allah or to believe in what Moses (peace be upon him) brought. They were a people who committed wrongs, who would not give up falsehood, and would not be guided to the truth."
"Yet when punishment overtook them, they said: ""O Moses, invoke your Lord for us as you have been enjoined. If the torment is removed, we shall certainly believe in you and let the people of Israel go with you.""",133,7,وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلرِّجْزُ قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَى ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا ٱلرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"When these torments came upon them, they asked Moses (peace be upon him): 'O Moses, call upon your Lord, because of what He has given you of prophethood and Allah’s promise to you that He will remove the torment for our turning to Him, to remove from us the torment, for then we will certainly believe in you, and will send the Children of Israel with you, releasing them from captivity.'"
But no sooner was the punishment withdrawn for a time to enable them to make good their promise than they broke it.,134,7,فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلرِّجْزَ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ هُم بَٰلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ,"But when Allah removed the torment from them for a set time – before they were destroyed through drowning – they went back on their word and did not believe him or send the Israelites with him, remaining firm on their disbelief, and not allowing the Israelites to go with Moses (peace be upon him)."
"So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea for rejecting Our signs and not heeding them.",135,7,فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَكَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا غَٰفِلِينَ,"So when the appointed time came for their destruction, I unleashed My punishment on them and drowned them in the sea because of their rejection of the signs of Allah and because they turned away from the truth about which there was no doubt."
"We then made the people who were weak (and oppressed) successors of the land to the East and the West which We had blessed. Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the children of Israel was fulfilled, for they were patient in adversity; and whatsoever the Pharaoh and his people had fashioned, and the structures they had raised, were destroyed.",136,7,وَأَوْرَثْنَا ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُوا۟ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَٰرِقَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَغَٰرِبَهَا ٱلَّتِى بَٰرَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ عَلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُوا۟ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُۥ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْرِشُونَ,"I made the Children of Israel, who had been humiliated by Pharaoh and his people, inherit the eastern areas of the land and the western areas of it (the lands of the Levant). Allah blessed this land, making it produce the best crops and fruits. So the good word of your Lord was fulfilled O Messenger where Allah says, ‘I wished to favour those who were weak in the earth, and to make them leaders and inheritors’ (Sūrat al-Qaṣaṣ: 5). So God established them in the land because of their patience in the face of the harm they had suffered from Pharaoh and his people, and God destroyed the agriculture and buildings of Pharaoh, and the palaces they had constructed."
"When We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols, they said: ""O Moses, make us also a god like theirs."" ""You are ignorant,"" he replied.",137,7,وَجَٰوَزْنَا بِبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَتَوْا۟ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَىٰٓ أَصْنَامٍ لَّهُمْ قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَى ٱجْعَل لَّنَآ إِلَٰهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ ءَالِهَةٌ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ,"And I made the Children of Israel cross the sea when Moses hit it with his stick and it parted. They passed a people who were worshipping idols, which they worshipped instead of Allah. The Children of Israel said to Moses (peace be upon him): 'O Moses, make us an idol to worship as these people have idols to worship.' Moses said: 'You are a people who are ignorant of the rights that are due to Allah alone concerning the belief in His Oneness and what is due to Him of reverence, and what is inappropriate to ascribe to Him of polytheism and the like.'"
"""These people and their ways will surely be destroyed, for false is what they practise.",138,7,إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مُتَبَّرٌ مَّا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَٰطِلٌ مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"'These people who are worshipping idols are ruined, and all of their works and devotion is false and worthless because they are worshipping other than Allah.'"
"""Do you want me to seek for you,"" he said, ""a god other than God, when He has exalted you over all the nations of the world?",139,7,قَالَ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْغِيكُمْ إِلَٰهًا وَهُوَ فَضَّلَكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Moses said: 'How can I seek for you a god other than the one true God for you to worship, when you have already seen His great signs, and when He has preferred you over all the nations of your time, granting you the destruction of your enemy, and making you leaders in the land and establishing you in it?'"
"""Remember (the day) when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who oppressed and afflicted you, and slew your sons and spared your women. In this was a great trial from your Lord.""",140,7,وَإِذْ أَنجَيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُقَتِّلُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,"And remember O Children of Israel, when I saved you from the humiliation of Pharaoh and his people, who were making you suffer greatly, killing your sons and letting your women live to serve them. Being saved from Pharaoh and his people was a great test from your Lord, to see if you would be thankful."
"We made an appointment of thirty nights with Moses (On Mount Sinai) to which We added ten more; so the term set by the Lord was completed in forty nights. Moses said to Aaron, his brother: ""Deputise for me among my people. Dispose rightly, and do not follow the way of the authors of evil.""",141,7,وَوَٰعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ ثَلَٰثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَٰهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَٰتُ رَبِّهِۦٓ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِأَخِيهِ هَٰرُونَ ٱخْلُفْنِى فِى قَوْمِى وَأَصْلِحْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"And Allah appointed for Moses a place of meeting of thirty nights in order to speak with him, and then He perfected it by adding ten more, so that there were forty nights all together. Moses told his brother Aaron, when he was leaving for this retreat alone with His Lord: 'O Aaron, take my place as leader among my people, and do what is right, governing them wisely and treating them kindly, and not following the path of those who cause corruption, nor committing disobedience, nor helping the wrongdoers.'"
"When Moses arrived at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: ""O Lord, reveal Yourself to me that I may behold You."" ""You cannot behold Me,"" He said. ""But look at the mountain: If it remains firm in its place you may then behold Me."" But when his Lord appeared on the mountain in His effulgence, it crumbled to a heap of dust, and Moses fell unconscious. When he came to, he said: ""All glory to You. I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe.""",142,7,وَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَٰتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِىٓ أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَىٰنِى وَلَٰكِنِ ٱنظُرْ إِلَى ٱلْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُۥ فَسَوْفَ تَرَىٰنِى فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُۥ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُۥ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَٰنَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"When Moses came to meet his Lord for the appointment he had been assigned, which was a full forty nights, and his Lord spoke to him giving him instructions and prohibitions and so on, Moses desired to see his Lord, so he asked to see Him. Allah the Exalted replied: 'You will not see Me in the life of this world, because you will not be able to endure that, but look instead at the mountain when I reveal Myself to it, if it remains in its place and is not affected then You will be able to see Me; but if it becomes flattened, then you will not be able to see Me in the life of this world.' Then when Allah revealed Himself to the mountain it crumbled to dust, and Moses fell down unconscious. When he recovered from his unconsciousness, he said: 'I declare Your Perfection O Lord, and that You are far above any deficiency being ascribed to You, and I turn to You asking for forgiveness for having asked to see You in this world, and I am the first of my people to believe.'"
"Said (the Lord): ""O Moses, I raised you above all men by sending My messages and speaking to you; so receive what I give you, and be grateful.""",143,7,قَالَ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنِّى ٱصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِرِسَٰلَٰتِى وَبِكَلَٰمِى فَخُذْ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُكَ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"Allah told Moses: 'O Moses, I have chosen you and preferred you over other people through the message which I have sent you with, and by My speaking to you directly. Take then the great honour which I have given you, and be among those who are thankful to Allah for such a great gift.'"
"And We wrote down on tablets admonitions and clear explanations of all things for Moses, and ordered him: ""Hold fast to them, and command your people to observe the best in them. I will show you the abode of the wicked.",144,7,وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْأَلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلًا لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُوا۟ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُو۟رِيكُمْ دَارَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Allah wrote for Moses in the Tablets everything that the Israelites would need for their spiritual and worldly affairs – instruction for those who would be instructed and an explanation of laws that needed explanation. He told Moses to take hold of them firmly and with determination, and to instruct his people, the Israelites, to take hold of the most excellent instructions that they contained, with the promise of the greatest reward for doing what they were instructed in the most perfect way, and to do so with patience and forgiveness. Allah told Moses that He would show them the destiny of those who went against His commands and who disobeyed Him, and the ruin and loss that they would receive as a result."
"I will turn those away from My signs who behave unjustly with arrogance in the land so that even though they see all the signs they will not believe in them; and if they see the path of rectitude, will not take it to be a way; and if they see the way of error take it to be the (right) path. This is so for they have called Our messages lies, and have been heedless of them.""",145,7,سَأَصْرِفُ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهَا وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ سَبِيلَ ٱلرُّشْدِ لَا يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ سَبِيلَ ٱلْغَىِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَكَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا غَٰفِلِينَ,"Those who are unjustly proud towards the servants of Allah and the truth will be turned away by Allah from thinking about His signs on the horizons and within themselves and from understanding His verses even if they see every sign, they will not believe in them, because of their rejection of these signs and their turning away from them, and for opposing Allah and His Messenger. If they see the path of truth which leads to the pleasure of Allah, they do not follow it, and do not like it; and if they see the way of misguidance and error leading to Allah’s displeasure, they follow it. This only happens to them because they rejected the great signs and verses of Allah proving the truth of what the messengers came with, and did not pay any attention to them."
Vain are the acts of those who deny Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter. Can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did?,146,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَلِقَآءِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Those who rejected the signs of Allah proving the truth of the messengers, and denied that they would meet with Allah on the Day of Judgement, their good actions will come to nothing, because they were not based on faith; and they will be repaid for their disbelief in Allah and for associating partners with Allah – the repayment for which is living eternally in the fire of Hell."
"In the absence of Moses his people prepared the image of a calf from their ornaments, which gave out the mooing of a cow. Yet they did not see it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the right path. Even then they took it (for a deity) and did wrong.",147,7,وَٱتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُۥ خُوَارٌ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّهُۥ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ وَلَا يَهْدِيهِمْ سَبِيلًا ٱتَّخَذُوهُ وَكَانُوا۟ ظَٰلِمِينَ,"After Moses had gone to meet with his Lord, his people took to worshipping a statue of a calf made from their ornaments, not possessing any soul, but which made a sound. Did they not know that this calf could not speak to them or guide them to any good way, material or spiritual, and that it could not bring anything of benefit to them or remove anything harmful from them? But they took to worshipping it and wronged themselves by doing so."
"Then they were filled with remorse and saw that they had erred and said: ""If our Lord does not forgive us we will surely be lost.""",148,7,وَلَمَّا سُقِطَ فِىٓ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَرَأَوْا۟ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ ضَلُّوا۟ قَالُوا۟ لَئِن لَّمْ يَرْحَمْنَا رَبُّنَا وَيَغْفِرْ لَنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"When they regretted their actions and did not know how to make-up for their wrongdoing, realising that they had gone astray from the straight path by worshipping the calf besides to Allah, they said: 'If our Lord does not have mercy on us, by enabling us to do as He instructed, and if He does not forgive us for having worshipped the calf, then we would certainly be among the losers in the life of this world and in the Afterlife.'"
"When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: ""How wickedly you behaved in my absence. Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?"" And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. ""O son of my mother,"" said (Aaron), ""these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors.""",149,7,وَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسَىٰٓ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ غَضْبَٰنَ أَسِفًا قَالَ بِئْسَمَا خَلَفْتُمُونِى مِنۢ بَعْدِىٓ أَعَجِلْتُمْ أَمْرَ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَلْقَى ٱلْأَلْوَاحَ وَأَخَذَ بِرَأْسِ أَخِيهِ يَجُرُّهُۥٓ إِلَيْهِ قَالَ ٱبْنَ أُمَّ إِنَّ ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱسْتَضْعَفُونِى وَكَادُوا۟ يَقْتُلُونَنِى فَلَا تُشْمِتْ بِىَ ٱلْأَعْدَآءَ وَلَا تَجْعَلْنِى مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Moses returned to his people from his meeting with His Lord full of anger and sadness upon finding them worshipping the calf. He said: 'What an evil condition you have fallen into after me O people, which leads only to ruin and misery! Were you tired of waiting for the appointed time of your Lord assigned for me – the forty nights – so you started to worship the calf!' Moses threw the Tablets down because of his extreme anger and sadness, and took his brother Aaron by the head and beard and dragged him, because he had been with them and had not been able to stop them from worshipping the calf. Aaron said to his brother Moses: 'O son of my mother, indeed the people considered me to be weak, not respecting me, and they had almost killed me; so do not punish me in a way that would make my enemies rejoice, and do not to include me out of your anger among the people who had done wrong by worshipping other than Allah.'"
"(Moses) said: ""O Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your grace, for You are the most compassionate of all.""",150,7,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِى وَلِأَخِى وَأَدْخِلْنَا فِى رَحْمَتِكَ وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"Moses said supplicating to his Lord: 'O Lord, forgive me and me brother Aaron, and enter us into Your Mercy, surrounding us with it, for You are to us the most Merciful of those who have mercy.'"
"Surely those who have taken the calf (as a god) will suffer the anger of their Lord, and disgrace in the world. That is how We requite those who fabricate lies.",151,7,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ ٱلْعِجْلَ سَيَنَالُهُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَذِلَّةٌ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُفْتَرِينَ,"Without doubt, those who worshipped the calf will receive their Lord’s anger, and will have humiliation in this life, for displeasing their Lord and not acting according to His Command. That is how Allah rewards those who invent lies about Allah."
"Yet those who do wrong, then repent and believe, are forgiven, for your Lord is forgiving and kind.",152,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ عَمِلُوا۟ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ ثُمَّ تَابُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِهَا وَءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Those who do wrong by associating others with Allah and committing sins, and then repent out of sincere faith, repenting from polytheism to having faith in Him alone, and repenting from disobedience to doing good actions, giving up all kinds of sins whilst seeking His forgiveness-Allah will be forgiving and merciful to them, erasing and overlooking what they have done."
When his anger subsided Moses picked up the tablets. Inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their Lord.,153,7,وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ عَن مُّوسَى ٱلْغَضَبُ أَخَذَ ٱلْأَلْوَاحَ وَفِى نُسْخَتِهَا هُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِرَبِّهِمْ يَرْهَبُونَ,"When the anger of Moses (peace be upon him) had subsided and he calmed down, he picked up the Tablets, which he had thrown down in anger. These Tablets contained guidance and an explanation of the truth; a mercy for those who stand in fear of their Lord, and are mindful of His consequences."
"Moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment (on Mount Sinai). When they arrived they were seized by a tremor. (Moses) said: ""O Lord, if You had so pleased You could have annihilated them and me before this. Will You destroy us for something the foolish among us have done? This is but a trial from You whereby You will lead whom You will astray and guide whom You please. You are our saviour, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of forgivers.",154,7,وَٱخْتَارَ مُوسَىٰ قَوْمَهُۥ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلًا لِّمِيقَٰتِنَا فَلَمَّآ أَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ قَالَ رَبِّ لَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكْتَهُم مِّن قَبْلُ وَإِيَّٰىَ أَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَّآ إِنْ هِىَ إِلَّا فِتْنَتُكَ تُضِلُّ بِهَا مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَهْدِى مَن تَشَآءُ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْغَٰفِرِينَ,"Moses chose seventy of the best men among his people to ask for forgiveness for what the foolish among them had done in worshipping the calf. Allah appointed a time and place for them, though when they reached there they became bold and asked Moses to let them see Allah with their eyes. So an earthquake seized them, and they were struck down and killed by the strength of it. So Moses begged his Lord, saying: 'O Lord, if You had willed to destroy them and myself before they had come to You, You could have done so. Would You destroy us because of what the foolish amongst us have done. What my people have done in worshipping the calf, was only a trial and test by which You led astray whom You willed, and guided whom you willed. You are our Protector, so forgive us our sins, and have mercy on us, for You are the best of those who forgive and overlook.'"
"Enjoin for us good in the world, and good in the world to come. We turn to You alone."" And the Lord said: ""I punish only those whom I will, but My mercy enfolds everything. I shall enjoin it for those who take heed for themselves, who pay the zakat and believe in My signs,",155,7,وَٱكْتُبْ لَنَا فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ إِنَّا هُدْنَآ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ عَذَابِىٓ أُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَنْ أَشَآءُ وَرَحْمَتِى وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَسَأَكْتُبُهَا لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"' And make us among those You have favoured with Your blessings and well-being, enabling us to do good works. And make us from among Your righteous servants for whom You have prepared Paradise. Indeed we turn to You in repentance, admitting our mistakes.' Allah said: 'I give My punishment to whom I will; those who do the actions leading to misery, and My Mercy surrounds all things in this world. There is no created being or object that My Mercy has not reached, immersed in My Grace and Kindness. I will decree My Mercy in the Afterlife for those who are mindful of Me, following what I instruct and staying away from what I have prohibited, giving charity from their wealth as they have been ordered, and who have faith in My signs.'"
"Who follow the messenger, the gentile Prophet, described in the Torah and the Gospel, who bids things noble and forbids things vile, makes lawful what is clean, and prohibits what is foul, who relieves them of their burdens, and the yoke that lies upon them. Those who believe and honour and help him, and follow the light sent with him, are those who will attain their goal.""",156,7,ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلرَّسُولَ ٱلنَّبِىَّ ٱلْأُمِّىَّ ٱلَّذِى يَجِدُونَهُۥ مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِى ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَٱلْإِنجِيلِ يَأْمُرُهُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَىٰهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْخَبَٰٓئِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَٱلْأَغْلَٰلَ ٱلَّتِى كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ ٱلنُّورَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ مَعَهُۥٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"The ones just described are those who follow Muhammad (peace be upon him), the illiterate prophet who cannot read or write, and who is only inspired by His Lord. The name and description of the Prophet and what is revealed to him is to be found in the Torah, revealed to Moses (peace be upon him), and the Gospel, revealed to Jesus (peace be upon him). Muhammad instructed people to that which is good and right, and forbade those things that sound minds, those with a sound nature, know to be bad: allowing them the good food and drink and relationships which are not harmful, and making unlawful those things which are bad. He also removed the difficult commandments revealed as obligations to previous communities, such as having to kill the one who killed someone else accidentaly. Those who believed in him from among the Israelites and others, respecting and honouring him and helping him against the disbelievers who were his enemies, following the Qur’ān which was revealed to him, they are the successful ones who will attain what they desire and attain safety from what they fear."
"Say: ""O men, I am verily the apostle of God to you all. His whose kingdom extends over the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He, the giver of life and death. So believe in God and the messenger, the gentile Prophet, sent by Him, who believes in God and His messages. Obey him; you may haply be guided aright.""",157,7,قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ فَـَٔامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ٱلنَّبِىِّ ٱلْأُمِّىِّ ٱلَّذِى يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَٱتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Allah tells the Prophet (peace be upon him) to inform people that he is the messenger of Allah to them all, both Arabs and non-Arabs. Allah alone controls the heavens and the earth. There is nothing worthy of worship other than Him, glory be to Him. He brings the dead to life, and causes what is alive to die. People should have faith in Allah and in Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Prophet, His Messenger, who cannot read or write, and who came only with what His Lord revealed to him, in order to guide them to what is good for them in this world and in the Afterlife."
"Among the people of Moses is a section that shows the way to the truth, and deals justly in accordance with it.",158,7,وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰٓ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَبِهِۦ يَعْدِلُونَ,"There is a group from the people of Moses amongst the Israelites who stand for the truth, and guide people to it, and who are just in their rulings between people through it."
"We divided them into twelve (different) tribes. When his people asked for water, We said to Moses: ""Strike the rock with your staff;"" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and We made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): ""Eat of the good things We have provided for you."" But (by disobeying) they did not harm Us, they harmed themselves.",159,7,وَقَطَّعْنَٰهُمُ ٱثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا أُمَمًا وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰٓ إِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَىٰهُ قَوْمُهُۥٓ أَنِ ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنۢبَجَسَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْغَمَٰمَ وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٰكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Allah divided the Israelites into twelve tribes. Then, when his people were asking him to call upon Allah to give them water, He inspired Moses to hit the stone with his stick. Moses hit it and twelve springs gushed out of it, which was the same number as the number of tribes. Each of the tribes knew which one was their own drinking place, which none of the other tribes shared with them. Allah shaded them with clouds which followed them where they moved and stopped with them. He also sent them manna, which was similar like gum with a sweet taste, and quails, or a bird similar to quails, and told them to eat of the good things He had provided for them. They did not wrong Allah through their disobedience and ingratitude for the blessings they were given, not appreciating them as they should have been, but they wronged themselves, bringing themselves to ruin through going against the commands of Allah and not acknowledging His blessings to them."
"And when it was said to them: ""Live in this land and eat of its produce wheresoever you like, and ask for remission of your sins, but pass through the gates with submission (and not pride), We shall forgive your trespasses, and give to those who are righteous abundance,""",160,7,وَإِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱسْكُنُوا۟ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ وَكُلُوا۟ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ وَقُولُوا۟ حِطَّةٌ وَٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطِيٓـَٰٔتِكُمْ سَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Allah told the Israelites to enter Jerusalem, and to eat from any of the fruits of the town, whenever they wished, and to ask Allah to remove their disobedience from them. He told them to enter the gate in humility, and that He would forgive them for their mistakes and would increase those who do good in the good things of this world and of the Afterlife."
The wicked among them changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word unpronounced; so We sent from heaven retribution on them for all their wickedness.,161,7,فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ قَوْلًا غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِجْزًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَظْلِمُونَ,"But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were told to say, and said ‘A grain in a rite’, instead of asking for forgiveness, as they had been instructed to; and they changed what they had been told to do by entering whilst dragging themselves on their rears, rather than entering in humility to Allah, lowering their heads. So Allah sent them a punishment from the heaven because of their disobedience."
"Enquire of them about the town situated by the sea where, when they did not keep the Sabbath, the fish came up to the surface of the water for them; but on days other than the Sabbath the fish did not come. We tried them in this way, for they were disobedient.",162,7,وَسْـَٔلْهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِى كَانَتْ حَاضِرَةَ ٱلْبَحْرِ إِذْ يَعْدُونَ فِى ٱلسَّبْتِ إِذْ تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ يَوْمَ سَبْتِهِمْ شُرَّعًا وَيَوْمَ لَا يَسْبِتُونَ لَا تَأْتِيهِمْ كَذَٰلِكَ نَبْلُوهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْسُقُونَ,"Ask the Jews about how Allah punished some of the Israelites. Remind them of the story of the town which was near to the sea where they used to overstep the limits of Allah: fishing on the Sabbath after they had been forbidden from doing so. Allah tested them by making the fish come to them so that they could see them clearly on the surface of the sea on Saturday, and then making them disappear from view during the rest of the week. Allah gave them this trial because of their disobedience and wrongdoing. So eventually they decided to fish by setting up their nets thereby using a trick, so that the fish would fall into them on Saturday and they could take them and eat them on Sunday."
"When a Section of them said: ""Why do you admonish a people whom God is about to destroy or to punish severely?"" They replied: ""To clear ourselves of blame before your Lord, and that they may fear God.",163,7,وَإِذْ قَالَتْ أُمَّةٌ مِّنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمًا ٱللَّهُ مُهْلِكُهُمْ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا قَالُوا۟ مَعْذِرَةً إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"Mention, O Messenger, when a group among them forbade them from doing what was wrong, cautioning them against it. Another group remarked: 'Why are you advising those whom Allah is going to destroy in this world because of their disobedience, or punish with a firm punishment on the Day of Judgement?' Those advising replied: 'This advising of ours is to be free from blame before Allah, through doing what He commanded us to do of instructing what is right and forbidding what is wrong, so that He would not take us to account for not doing so; and, perhaps, those we advise might benefit from the advice, and give up their disobedience.'"
"But when they forgot to remember the warning, We saved those who prohibited evil, but inflicted on the wicked a dreadful punishment -- requital for their disobedience.",164,7,فَلَمَّا نَسُوا۟ مَا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِهِۦٓ أَنجَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلسُّوٓءِ وَأَخَذْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ بِعَذَابٍۭ بَـِٔيسٍۭ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْسُقُونَ,"When the wrongdoers turned away from what those who advised them had reminded them of, and they would not give up their disobedience, Allah saved the group which had forbidden disobedience from the punishment, and afflicted those who transgressed the limits by fishing on the Saturday with a firm punishment, because they were not obedient to Allah and persisted in their rebellion."
"When they persisted in doing what they had been forbidden, We said to them: ""Become (like) apes despised.""",165,7,فَلَمَّا عَتَوْا۟ عَن مَّا نُهُوا۟ عَنْهُ قُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا۟ قِرَدَةً خَٰسِـِٔينَ,"When they overstepped the limits, rebelling against Allah out of pride and stubbornness, and they would not be advised, Allah told them: 'O you disobedient ones! Be you monkeys, humiliated!' So they became what He willed, because when He wills something He only says to it ‘Be!’ and it is."
"And your Lord declared He would send men against them who would inflict dreadful suffering on them till the Day of Doom, for your Lord is swift in retribution, though He is certainly forgiving and kind.",166,7,وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مَن يَسُومُهُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Mention, O Messenger, when Allah declared in clear terms that He would put over the Jews those who would humiliate and humble them in this life until the Day of Judgement. Your Lord is quick with the punishment for those who go against Him, sometimes punishing them in the worldly life. Yet He is Forgiving to whoever repents to Him from among His servants, and is Merciful to them."
"We dispersed them in groups over the earth, some righteous, some otherwise; and We tried them with good things and bad, that they may haply turn back.",167,7,وَقَطَّعْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أُمَمًا مِّنْهُمُ ٱلصَّٰلِحُونَ وَمِنْهُمْ دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ وَبَلَوْنَٰهُم بِٱلْحَسَنَٰتِ وَٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"And I broke and separated them up in the earth, dividing them into communities, after they had been united. Among them were those who were righteous and who upheld the rights of Allah and the rights of His creatures; among them were those who were moderate; and among them were those who were excessive in their disobedience. Allah tested them with ease and difficulty, so that they might return from what they were doing."
"Then after them a new generation inherited the Book. They took to the things of this base world, and said: ""We shall (surely) be forgiven this."" Yet they will accept similar things if they came their way again. Had they not been covenanted in the Book to say nothing in the name of God but the truth? And they have read this in it. The abode of the life to come is better for those who fear God. Can they not comprehend?",168,7,فَخَلَفَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ وَرِثُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَٰذَا ٱلْأَدْنَىٰ وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مِّثْلُهُۥ يَأْخُذُوهُ أَلَمْ يُؤْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَٰقُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَن لَّا يَقُولُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلْحَقَّ وَدَرَسُوا۟ مَا فِيهِ وَٱلدَّارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Then an evil people followed after these people, receiving the Torah from those who came before them. They read it but did not act according to what was in it, taking the miserable goods of this life as a bribe to distort the scripture of Allah; and they gave judgements which were not according to what was revealed in the scripture, convincing themselves that Allah would forgive them their sins. If some petty worldly gain should come their way, they would take it every time. Did Allah not make promises and contracts with these people that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth, without distorting or changing anything? Their failure to act according to what was in the scripture was not due to ignorance, but was in full knowledge, because they had studied what was in the scripture and knew it, which meant that their disobedience was greater. Yet the home of the Afterlife and its eternal bliss is far better than any passing gain that they may have been given as a bribe. It is for those who are Mindful, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited. Do those who take these insignificant goods not understand that what Allah has prepared for those who are mindful in the Afterlife is far better and more lasting?"
"As for those who adhere to the Book and are firm in devotion, We shall certainly not let the wages of those who are upright to go waste.",169,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُمَسِّكُونَ بِٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِينَ,"Those who hold tightly to the scripture and act according to it, establishing the prayer as it should be established and in its set times, Allah will reward their actions – Allah does not allow the reward of those who act well to be lost."
"The day We shook the mountain above them like an awning, and they feared it would fall over them, (We said): ""Hold fast to what We have given you, and bear in mind what is (said) therein so that you may take heed.""",170,7,وَإِذْ نَتَقْنَا ٱلْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُۥ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُۥ وَاقِعٌۢ بِهِمْ خُذُوا۟ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"Mention, O Muhammad, when Allah raised the mountain above the Israelites when they refused to accept what was in the Torah. Then the mountain became like a cloud, casting a shadow over them, and they were sure it would fall upon them. They were told to firmly and seriously hold onto what Allah had revealed to them, and to remember the rulings that He had made law for them, and not to forget this, so that they might be Mindful."
"When your Lord brings forth from their loins the offspring of the children of Adam, He makes them witnesses over themselves, (and asks): ""Am I not your Lord?"" 'Indeed,' they reply. 'We bear witness,' -- lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ""We were not aware of this;""",171,7,وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِنۢ بَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ شَهِدْنَآ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هَٰذَا غَٰفِلِينَ,"Mention, O Muhammad, when your Lord took from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them acknowledge, bearing witness to His lordship, making it part of their innate nature to acknowledge that He created them and that He is their Lord. He said to them, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ and they replied, ‘Yes, we bear witness’. Allah said: 'I asked you this question so that you would not deny the proofs of Allah on the Day of Judgement, saying that you did not have any knowledge of it."
"Or, lest they should say: ""It were our fathers who had ascribed compeers to God; we are only their offspring. Will You destroy us for the deeds of those who dealt in vanities?""",172,7,أَوْ تَقُولُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَآ أَشْرَكَ ءَابَآؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا ذُرِّيَّةً مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ أَفَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,"'Lest you might say that your ancestors were the ones who broke the promise, taking others as partners with Allah, and that you were just following them. In this way, you would say: 'O our Lord! Will You destroy us for what our ancestors did, making our actions worthless because of taking others as partners with You?! Indeed we carry no sin because we were just following our ancestors and had no knowledge.'"
That is how We explain Our signs distinctly so that they may come back (to the right path).,173,7,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"So just as I made clear the signs and evidences for the previous nations, I make clear the lessons for these people (Quraish) so that they might repent from worshiping others as partners with Allah to believing in Him alone and worshipping Him alone, as they had agreed aforetime before they broke their promise."
"Relate to them the plight of the man whom We gave Our signs, but he passed them by, so that Satan came after him, and he went astray.",174,7,وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُ ءَايَٰتِنَا فَٱنسَلَخَ مِنْهَا فَأَتْبَعَهُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَاوِينَ,"Recite to the Israelites the news of the man from among them who Allah gave His signs to, so that he knew and understood the truth which they directed him to. But he did not act according to them, leaving them and removing himself away from them, so that Satan became his close companion, and he became one of those who go astray and are ruined, after he had been one of those who were rightly-guided and on the path to being saved."
"We wished to exalt him, but he loved baseness and followed his lust. His likeness is that of a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away, and still hangs it out if you leave him alone. Such is the case of the people who deny Our signs. Narrate this history to them; they may haply reflect.",175,7,وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَرَفَعْنَٰهُ بِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّهُۥٓ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ فَمَثَلُهُۥ كَمَثَلِ ٱلْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث ذَّٰلِكَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَٱقْصُصِ ٱلْقَصَصَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"If Allah had desired, He would have made this person benefit through these signs, enabling him to act according to them, so that he would be raised up in this world and in the next. But he chose what led to his failure, being attracted to the desires of the worldly life, and preferring them to the Afterlife. His example in his extreme greed for this world is like the example of a dog, which pants with its tongue constantly, whether it is resting or whether it is chased away. This example is the example of the people who are astray because of rejecting Allah’s signs. So relate the stories to them O Messenger so that they may think and reject their denial of the truth and their misguidance."
Evil is the case of those who deny Our signs and wrong themselves.,176,7,سَآءَ مَثَلًا ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَأَنفُسَهُمْ كَانُوا۟ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Is there anything worse than a people who reject Allah’s signs and proofs, not believing them, wronging themselves through doing so and only gaining their own ruin."
He alone is guided whom God shows the way; and whom He leads astray is surely lost.,177,7,مَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِى وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Whoever Allah allows to be guided to the right path is truly guided, because they chose the path of their Lord; and whoever Allah does not lead to His path, sending them away from it because of their deviation and bad actions, those are the true losers, who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Judgment – is that not complete loss?"
"Many of the jinns and human beings have We destined for Hell, who possess hearts but do not feel, have eyes but do not see, have ears but do not hear, like cattle, even worse than them. They are people unconcerned.",178,7,وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ ءَاذَانٌ لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ كَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰفِلُونَ,"And I made for the Hellfire, many people from Humankind and the Jinn, because of My Knowledge that they would do the actions of the people of Hell. They have hearts by which they do not understand what will benefit them and what will harm them; eyes which they do not use to see the signs of Allah within themselves and upon the horizons, so that they can learn from them; and they have ears which they do not use to listen to the verses of Allah, so that they might reflect over them. Such people resemble cattle in their lack of sense – rather, they are even more astray. They are oblivious to faith in Allah and the Last day."
"All the names of God are beautiful, so call Him by them; and leave those alone who act profanely towards His names: They will be retributed for their deeds.",179,7,وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا وَذَرُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِىٓ أَسْمَٰٓئِهِۦ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"To Allah, glory be to Him, belongs the most beautiful names which show His majesty and perfection. So use them to call on Allah when you ask for whatever you wish for. Also leave those who turn away from the truth of these names by assigning them to false dieties, or denying them, or distorting their meanings. Allah will repay those who do this with a painful punishment."
"Yet there are among those We have created people who lead (others) to the truth, and act justly in its light",180,7,وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَبِهِۦ يَعْدِلُونَ,"Among those Allah created are a nation which is guided by the truth, calling others to it so that they are also guided, and through the truth they are just in their judgement. They are the leaders of guidance whom Allah blessed with faith and good works."
We shall punish those who deny Our revelations slowly in a way that they will not know.,181,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Those who deny My signs, not having faith in them and rejecting them, I will continue to provide for them in the worldly life, not to honour them, but to lead them on gradually until they go further astray. Then they will be overtaken by the punishment when they do not expect it."
I will just give them respite. My plan is certainly invincible.,182,7,وَأُمْلِى لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ,"I delay the punishment of such people until they think they will not receive a punishment, so they keep increasing in their rejection and disbelief, thus their punishment also increases. My Planning is Strong-I outwardly display to them Kindness, but I intend for them to be forsaken."
Have they not bethought themselves their companion is not mad? He is only a plain admonisher.,183,7,أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُوا۟ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Do those who reject the signs of Allah and His Messenger not think about things? If they used their minds it would be clear to them that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not crazy. He is a messenger from Allah, Who sent him to give a clear warning about the punishment of Allah."
"Have they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by God, (to educe) that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close? In what lore after this would they then believe?",184,7,أَوَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا۟ فِى مَلَكُوتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ قَدِ ٱقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍۭ بَعْدَهُۥ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Do these people learn nothing from seeing Allah’s control of the heavens and the earth, and all the animals and plants and other things that Allah created in them, and their own life spans, the end of which may be near, so that they might repent to Allah before the time has gone? If they do not have faith in the Qur’ān and the promises it contains, what other book will they believe in?"
"Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way, for He leaves them to wander perplexed in their wickedness.",185,7,مَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَا هَادِىَ لَهُۥ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"Whoever Allah does not guide to the truth, sending them away from the right path, then there is no guide to direct them back to guidance. Allah leaves them in their misguidance and disbelief, wandering blindly, not being guided to anything that will ultimately benefit."
"They ask you about the Hour: ""When is its determined time?"" Say: ""Only my Lord has the knowledge. No one can reveal it except He. Oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth. When it comes, it will come unawares."" They ask you about it as if you were in the know. You tell them: ""Only God has the knowledge."" But most people do not know.",186,7,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلسَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَىٰهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّى لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ ثَقُلَتْ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Those who reject the truth and proud ask you about the Hour, asking when its appointed time is. Say to them O Muhammad: 'I do not have knowledge of it, nor anyone else; but Allah alone has knowledge of it. Only Allah will reveal its decreed time. Its appearance is hidden from all of those in the heavens and earth, and it will only come upon them unexpectedly.' They ask you O Muhammad about the Hour as if you are eager to know it, not realising that you did not ask about it because of your knowledge of your Lord. Say to them O Muhammad: 'The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone, but most people do not know this.'"
"Tell them: ""I am not master of my own gain or loss but as God may please. If I had the knowledge of the Unknown I would have enjoyed abundance of the good, and no evil would have touched me. I am only a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for those who believe.""",187,7,قُل لَّآ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِى نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا إِلَّا مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْ كُنتُ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ لَٱسْتَكْثَرْتُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْرِ وَمَا مَسَّنِىَ ٱلسُّوٓءُ إِنْ أَنَا۠ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Say to them O Muhammad: 'I do not have the ability to bring good to myself, or to remove any harm from myself, except by Allah’s will. The dominion of these things belongs to Allah alone, and I only know what Allah taught me. I do not know the unseen, because if I did, I would have used what I know to serve my own interests, and to protect myself from misfortune, due to knowing about things before they happened. I am only a messenger from Allah, warning of a painful punishment, and bringing good news of Allah’s generous reward for a people who have faith, believing that I am a messenger from Him, and in what was revealed to me.'"
"It is He who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, that you may live as companions. When the man covered the woman she conceived a light burden and carried it about. And when she was heavy (with child) they prayed together to their Lord: ""If You bestow a healthy son on us we shall truly be grateful.""",188,7,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا لِيَسْكُنَ إِلَيْهَا فَلَمَّا تَغَشَّىٰهَا حَمَلَتْ حَمْلًا خَفِيفًا فَمَرَّتْ بِهِۦ فَلَمَّآ أَثْقَلَت دَّعَوَا ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُمَا لَئِنْ ءَاتَيْتَنَا صَٰلِحًا لَّنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"It is He who created you from one soul, Prophet Adam (peace be upon him), and created from Adam (peace be upon him) his wife, Eve, creating her from his rib, so he would be close friends with her, and find peace with her. When he had relations with her she became pregnant with a light load, not noticed because it is at the beginning of the pregnancy. A woman continues with the pregnancy going about things without finding it heavy, until she becomes heavy with it when it has grown in her belly, the two of them call upon their Lord, saying: 'O our Lord, if You grant us a healthy child, we will be thankful for Your blessings.'"
"But when they were given a healthy son, they started ascribing to other powers a share in what God had bestowed on them. But God is above what they ascribe to Him.",189,7,فَلَمَّآ ءَاتَىٰهُمَا صَٰلِحًا جَعَلَا لَهُۥ شُرَكَآءَ فِيمَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمَا فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"But when Allah responds to their prayer, and gives them a healthy child as they asked, they ascribe partners to Allah in what He gave to them when Allah is far above having any partner, and is alone in His divinity."
"Do they associate those with Him who cannot create a thing, and are themselves created,",190,7,أَيُشْرِكُونَ مَا لَا يَخْلُقُ شَيْـًٔا وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ,"Do they consider these idols and other things to be partners with Allah being worthy of worship, when they know that these idols create nothing. Rather, they were created themselves, so how can they consider them to be partners with Allah in divinity?"
"Who can neither help them, nor help themselves?",191,7,وَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ لَهُمْ نَصْرًا وَلَآ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَنصُرُونَ,"These things that are worshipped instead of Allah cannot help those who worship them, and cannot even help themselves, so worshipping them is clearly foolish and ignorant."
If you call them to guidance they will not follow you. It is all the same if you call them or hold your tongue.,192,7,وَإِن تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ لَا يَتَّبِعُوكُمْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ أَدَعَوْتُمُوهُمْ أَمْ أَنتُمْ صَٰمِتُونَ,"And If you call these idols which you take as gods to guidance, they will not respond to what you call them to, nor can they follow you. It is the same whether you call them, or keep silent, because they are just objects, and are not conscious: they do not hear, and they cannot speak."
"Those whom you invoke besides God are created beings like you. So call on them and let them answer your call, if what you say is true.",193,7,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ فَٱدْعُوهُمْ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Those you call upon instead of Allah were created by Allah, and belong to Him, so they are the same as you in that way, although you are better in that you are living, and are able to speak and walk, and hear and see, while your idols are not so. Call on them and let them respond to you if you are telling the truth in what you say about them."
"Do they have feet to walk on, or hands to hold with, or eyes to see and ears to hear with? Say to them: ""Call your compeers, and work out a plot against me, and do not give me time.",194,7,أَلَهُمْ أَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا قُلِ ٱدْعُوا۟ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ ثُمَّ كِيدُونِ فَلَا تُنظِرُونِ,"Do these idols which they take as gods have feet to walk with, or hands to act with and strike? Or do they have eyes to see with, or ears to hear with? If they are incapable of doing these things, how can you worship them, hoping for benefit from them, or to protect yourself from harm? Say O Messenger: 'Call upon your partners all together, and plot whatever you will against me, and give me no respite.'"
My saviour is God who has revealed this Book; and He protects those who are upright;,195,7,إِنَّ وَلِۦِّىَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَهُوَ يَتَوَلَّى ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Truly, my protector is Allah, Who keeps me safe, so that I need no one besides Him. I fear nothing from your idols, because Allah sent down the Book as a guidance to people; and it is He Who protects those who do good among His creation, keeping them safe and helping them."
While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves.,196,7,وَٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَكُمْ وَلَآ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَنصُرُونَ,"Those you call upon O idolators from amongst these idols, are not able to help you, and are not able to help themselves. For they are utterly incapable, unable to do anything. So how can you call upon them instead of calling upon Allah?"
"When you call upon them for guidance, they do not hear. When you think they are looking at you, (in fact) they cannot see.""",197,7,وَإِن تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ لَا يَسْمَعُوا۟ وَتَرَىٰهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ,"If you call your idols which you worship instead of Allah to the right path and steadfastness, they will not hear you calling them. You see them facing you with painted eyes, objects that cannot see! For they used to make statues in the form of people and animals, with hands, feet and eyes, but they were just objects, inanimate and unable to move."
"Cultivate tolerance, enjoin justice, and avoid the fools.",198,7,خُذِ ٱلْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"Accept from people O Messenger what they are able to do, the actions and conduct that is easy for them, and do not require them to do things that are too difficult for them, because that will drive them away. Instruct them to speak in a beautiful way and to do good actions, and turn away from those who are foolish and do not face them in their ignorance, returning like for like. Whoever harms you, do not harm them; and whoever denies you something, do not deny them."
"If you are instigated by the Devil to evil seek refuge in God, for God hears all and knows everything.",199,7,وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ نَزْغٌ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"And If you feel that Satan is bringing you an evil suggestion or stopping you from doing good, then ask Allah for protection and seek refuge with Him. He hears whatever you say, and is aware of you when you seek protection, and He will protect you from him."
"Verily those who fear God think of Him when assailed by the instigations of Satan, and lo! they begin to understand,",200,7,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ إِذَا مَسَّهُمْ طَٰٓئِفٌ مِّنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ تَذَكَّرُوا۟ فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْصِرُونَ,"Those who are mindful of Allah, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, when an evil suggestion comes to them from Satan to do something wrong, they remember the might of Allah and His punishment for the wrongdoers and His reward for those who do good. They turn away from their disobedience, turning to Allah asking for forgiveness, so that they do the right thing, seeing clearly what they were doing wrong, and hold back from doing it."
"Even though their (devilish) brothers would like them to continue in error, and would not desist.",201,7,وَإِخْوَٰنُهُمْ يَمُدُّونَهُمْ فِى ٱلْغَىِّ ثُمَّ لَا يُقْصِرُونَ,"The brothers of the satans, who commit immorality and disbelieve, are drawn by the satans into greater error, committing sin after sin. They do not stop in their efforts: neither the satans with their misguidance nor those who are immoral and who follow them, committing evil."
"And when you do not bring a (Qur'anic) verse to them, they say: ""Why don't you make one up?"" Say: ""I follow only what my Lord reveals to me."" These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.",202,7,وَإِذَا لَمْ تَأْتِهِم بِـَٔايَةٍ قَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا ٱجْتَبَيْتَهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَتَّبِعُ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ مِن رَّبِّى هَٰذَا بَصَآئِرُ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"And If you O Messenger come with a sign, they reject it and turn away from it; and if you do not come to them with a sign, they ask why he did not produce one. Say to them O Messenger: 'It is not up to me to just come with a sign. Rather, I only follow what was revealed to me from Allah: the Qur’ān which I recite to you, an evidence and proof from Allah your Creator, the arranger of your lives, a guidance and mercy for the believers among His creation. As for those who do not have faith, then they are lost and wretched.'"
When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.,203,7,وَإِذَا قُرِئَ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ فَٱسْتَمِعُوا۟ لَهُۥ وَأَنصِتُوا۟ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"When the Qur’ān is recited, listen to it being recited: do not talk, and do not busy yourself with something else, so that Allah may have mercy on you."
"Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.",204,7,وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ فِى نَفْسِكَ تَضَرُّعًا وَخِيفَةً وَدُونَ ٱلْجَهْرِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلْءَاصَالِ وَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْغَٰفِلِينَ,"And remember Allah your Lord, humbly, with lowliness before Him, and with fear and awe. Call upon him in a moderate manner, not too loudly, at the beginning and end of the day, because of the special qualities of these times, and do not be among those who neglect the remembrance of Allah the Exalted."
"Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him'.",205,7,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِۦ وَيُسَبِّحُونَهُۥ وَلَهُۥ يَسْجُدُونَ,"The angels who are with your Lord are never too proud to worship Him, Glory be to Him. Rather, they devote themselves to worship with dedication, never tiring, glorifying Him day and night, and prostrating to Him."
"THEY ASK YOU of (benefits accruing as) spoils of war. Tell them: ""The benefits belong to God and His Messenger."" So fulfil your duty to God and keep peace among yourselves. Obey God and the Prophet, If you really believe.",0,8,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْأَنفَالِ قُلِ ٱلْأَنفَالُ لِلَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَصْلِحُوا۟ ذَاتَ بَيْنِكُمْ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Your Companions ask you O Messenger about the gains of war and how to distribute it, and who it should be for. Say to them: 'The gains of war are for Allah and His Messenger to distribute, and it is only incumbent on you to accept and comply in the matter, so be mindful of Allah, following what He instructed and staying away from what He had prohibited, correct disagreements between yourselves and mend bad relations, and develop good terms with each other through treating each other in a good way and forgiving each other. Follow Allah and His Messenger if you are true believers, for surely faith leads to doing good and staying away from disobedience.' This matter came up after the Battle of Badr."
"Only they are true believers whose hearts fill up with awe when the name of God is mentioned; and their faith is further strengthened when His messages are read out to them; and those who place their trust in their Lord,",1,8,إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُهُۥ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَٰنًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,"The true believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel awe of Him in their hearts, which make them do good actions. When the verses of Allah are read to them they reflect on them and it increases their faith, and they rely on Allah alone to bring them what is in their interests and to protect them from what is bad for them."
"Who are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them,",2,8,ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"Those who regularly establish the prayer, as it should be established, and in its set times, and who spend from what Allah has provided-on what is obligatory as well as what is recommended."
"Are true believers. There are for them (high) ranks with their Lord, and pardon and noble provision.",3,8,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقًّا لَّهُمْ دَرَجَٰتٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Such people are true believers, combining the qualities of inner faith and outer surrender. Their reward is in having a high rank with their Lord, forgiveness for their disobedience, and a generous provision, which is the bliss that Allah has prepared for them."
"As your Lord sent you from your home (to fight) for the true cause, a section of the faithful were averse,",4,8,كَمَآ أَخْرَجَكَ رَبُّكَ مِنۢ بَيْتِكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقًا مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ لَكَٰرِهُونَ,"Just as Allah took away the decision about the division of the gains of war from the Companions after their disagreement about how to distribute it, and made the decision for Himself and His Messenger (peace be upon him), He also instructed the Messenger (peace be upon him), through inspiration, to go out from Medina to meet the idol worshippers, although a group of the believers disliked this."
"Who argued with you about the matter even after it had become quite clear, as if they were being pushed into (the arms of) death as they waited.",5,8,يُجَٰدِلُونَكَ فِى ٱلْحَقِّ بَعْدَمَا تَبَيَّنَ كَأَنَّمَا يُسَاقُونَ إِلَى ٱلْمَوْتِ وَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ,"This group of the believers argued with the Messenger about fighting the idolaters, after it had been made clear to them that it had to happen, as if they were being driven to death, looking at it with open eyes. Their reaction was due to their strong dislike of going out to fight, because they were not prepared or ready for it."
"Though God promised that one of two columns (would fall to you), you desired the one that was not armed. But God wished to confirm the truth by His words, and wipe the unbelievers out to the last,",6,8,وَإِذْ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِحْدَى ٱلطَّآئِفَتَيْنِ أَنَّهَا لَكُمْ وَتَوَدُّونَ أَنَّ غَيْرَ ذَاتِ ٱلشَّوْكَةِ تَكُونُ لَكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُحِقَّ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَيَقْطَعَ دَابِرَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Allah reminds the believers who were arguing about when Allah promised them success over one of the groups of the idolaters: either the caravan with its sizeable wealth, so that they could take its bounty, or a group of fighters whom they would encounter and achieve victory over them; but they had wanted it to be the caravan, as this would be easy to take without having to fight. Yet Allah willed for the truth to be established through commanding them to fight, to kill the leaders of the idolaters, and to capture many of them so that the strength of Islam would become clear."
"So that Truth may be affirmed and falsehood negated, even though the sinners be averse.",7,8,لِيُحِقَّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيُبْطِلَ ٱلْبَٰطِلَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"This occurred so that Allah may establish the truth by making Islam and its people victorious, and for Him to make clear the error of falsehood, even if the idolaters disliked this."
"Remember when you prayed to your Lord for help, He heard you and said: ""I shall send a thousand angels following behind you for your aid.""",8,8,إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ أَنِّى مُمِدُّكُم بِأَلْفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ مُرْدِفِينَ,"Remember the day of Badr, when the Muslims asked for help from Allah for victory over their enemies, and Allah responded to them, reinforcing and helping them with a thousand angels, following one after another."
"He gave you the good news only to reassure your hearts, for victory comes from God alone, and certainly God is all-mighty and all-wise.",9,8,وَمَا جَعَلَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا بُشْرَىٰ وَلِتَطْمَئِنَّ بِهِۦ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَمَا ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلَّا مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Allah made the reinforcement of the Muslims with angels a form of good news for them: that He was helping them against their enemies, reassuring their hearts that they would have victory over them. Victory does not come because of having great numbers of fighters, or having large amounts of weapons and preparations; rather, it comes only from Allah, Glory be to Him. Allah is Mighty in His power, no one has power over Him, and He is Wise in His law and His decree."
"A blanketing sleep came over you as a (measure of) security from Him, and He sent down rain from the skies to cleanse you, and to remove the plague of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts and steady your steps.",10,8,إِذْ يُغَشِّيكُمُ ٱلنُّعَاسَ أَمَنَةً مِّنْهُ وَيُنَزِّلُ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً لِّيُطَهِّرَكُم بِهِۦ وَيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمْ رِجْزَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ وَلِيَرْبِطَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتَ بِهِ ٱلْأَقْدَامَ,"And remember O believers when Allah made you fall asleep on that occasion, giving you a feeling of safety and peace from the fear you had of your enemy. He sent down rain from the sky on you, to purify you, and to remove the evil suggestions of Satan from you and to make your hearts strong, so you would be patient when you met the enemy in battle. It also made your feet firm, by making the sandy ground hard so that your feet would not sink and slip on it."
"And the Lord said to the angels: ""I am with you; go and strengthen the faithful. I shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror. So smite them on their necks and every joint, (and incapacitate them),""",11,8,إِذْ يُوحِى رَبُّكَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ أَنِّى مَعَكُمْ فَثَبِّتُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ سَأُلْقِى فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلرُّعْبَ فَٱضْرِبُوا۟ فَوْقَ ٱلْأَعْنَاقِ وَٱضْرِبُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ كُلَّ بَنَانٍ,"Remember O Prophet when Allah inspired the angels, who He reinforced the believers with in the Battle of Badr, telling the angels: I am with you. aiding you with help and support, so strengthen the determination of the believers in fighting their enemy. I will cast great fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Strike then the necks of the disbelievers to kill them and hit their joints and limbs to hinder them from fighting."
For they had opposed God and His Apostle; but whosoever opposes God and his Apostle (should know) that God is severe in retribution.,12,8,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"What happened to the disbelievers, when they were killed and their limbs were struck, was because they went against Allah and His Messenger. They did not follow what they were instructed to do, and did not stop doing what they were told not to do. Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, Allah is firm with the punishment for them in this world, with death and capture, and in the Afterlife, with the fire of Hell."
"For you is this (punishment) to taste, for the infidels the torment of Hell.",13,8,ذَٰلِكُمْ فَذُوقُوهُ وَأَنَّ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,"That is the punishment for you, O you who oppose Allah and His Messenger, so taste it, for it has been hastened to you in the life of this world. In the Afterlife, you will have the punishment of the fire of Hell if you die stubbornly denying the truth."
"O believers, when you meet unbelievers on the field of battle, do not turn your backs to them.",14,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا لَقِيتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ زَحْفًا فَلَا تُوَلُّوهُمُ ٱلْأَدْبَارَ,"O you who believe in Allah and who follow His Messenger, if you meet the idolaters approaching them in battle, then do not turn your backs to them and run away; but be patient when facing them, and firm when you meet, because Allah is with you with His help and support."
"For any one who turns his back on that day, except to manoeuvre or rally to his side, will bring the wrath of God on himself, and have Hell as abode; and what an evil destination!",15,8,وَمَن يُوَلِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ دُبُرَهُۥٓ إِلَّا مُتَحَرِّفًا لِّقِتَالٍ أَوْ مُتَحَيِّزًا إِلَىٰ فِئَةٍ فَقَدْ بَآءَ بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَىٰهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"And whoever turns their back running away- unless they are withdrawing as a strategy with the intention of turning back to fight, or doing it to join a group of Muslims in order to help them-then certainly, he will earn the anger of Allah, and his place in the Hereafter will be Hell; what a miserable destination and final destiny!"
"It was not you who killed them, but God did so. You did not throw what you threw, (sand into the eyes of the enemy at Badr), but God, to bring out the best in the faithful by doing them a favour of His own. God is all-hearing and all-knowing.",16,8,فَلَمْ تَقْتُلُوهُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَتَلَهُمْ وَمَا رَمَيْتَ إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَمَىٰ وَلِيُبْلِىَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْهُ بَلَآءً حَسَنًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"For you did not O believers, kill the idolaters on the day of Badr because of your power and might, but rather Allah supported you in that. And you O Prophet did not throw sand at the idolaters, rather it was Allah, Who made what you throw reach them. Allah tested the believers by blessing them with victory over their enemies, despite their small numbers of fighters and weapons, so that they might be thankful to Him. Indeed Allah listens to your prayers and what you say, and He knows what you do, and what is best for you."
"That was that, but remember God will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible.",17,8,ذَٰلِكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُوهِنُ كَيْدِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The killing of the idolaters, your throwing, so that they were defeated, as well as Allah’s kindness to the believers giving them victory over their enemy, was all from Allah. Allah makes weak the plans of those who disbelieve and who plot against Islam."
"You had asked for a judgement, so the judgement has come to you (In the form of victory for the faithful). So, if you desist it will be better for you. If you come back to it, We shall do the same, and your forces, however large, will not be of the least avail, for God is with those who believe.",18,8,إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُوا۟ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُوا۟ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَعُودُوا۟ نَعُدْ وَلَن تُغْنِىَ عَنكُمْ فِئَتُكُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَلَوْ كَثُرَتْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"If you ask O idolaters, for the punishment and might of Allah to fall upon the wrongdoers who overstep the limits, then Allah has already made what you asked afflict you, sending down on you what was a lesson for you and for the mindful. If you stop asking for this it would be better for you, so that He might give you time, not giving you what you deserve immediately. But if you return to asking for a judgement and fighting the believers, Allah would also return by afflicting you with punishment and helping the believers. Your people and helpers would not be of any good to you, even if they are many and well prepared and the believers were few in number. Allah is with the believers, helping and supporting them, and whomever Allah assists, then no one will be able to defeat them."
"O believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him when you hear (him speak);",19,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَلَا تَوَلَّوْا۟ عَنْهُ وَأَنتُمْ تَسْمَعُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, obey Allah and His Messenger, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, not turning away from Him or going against His laws, and doing what He has forbidden especially whilst you are listening to the verses of Allah being recited to you."
"And do not be like those who say: ""We have heard,"" but do not hear.",20,8,وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا وَهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ,"And do not be O you believers, like the hypocrites and idolators who when the verses of Allah are recited to them, say that they have heard the Qur’ān that has been recited to them, when they have not listened in a reflective way, learning from it so that they would benefit from what they heard."
The worst of creatures in the eyes of God are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense.,21,8,إِنَّ شَرَّ ٱلدَّوَآبِّ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلْبُكْمُ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"The worst of creatures on the face of the earth in the sight of Allah are those who are deaf to the truth, not listening to it and accepting it; and dumb, not acknowledging the truth or calling to it, because they do not understand what Allah instructs or forbids."
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear. Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away (in obduracy).,22,8,وَلَوْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لَّأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّوا۟ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"If Allah knew that there was good in these idolaters who reject the truth, He would have made them listen in a way that was beneficial to them, so that they would understand the proof and evidence; but He knows that there is no good in them, and that if He made them hear, they would still turn away stubbornly, rejecting what they heard."
"O believers, respond to the call of God and His Prophet when he calls you to what will give you life (and preservation). Remember that God intervenes between man and his heart, and that you will be gathered before Him.",23,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحُولُ بَيْنَ ٱلْمَرْءِ وَقَلْبِهِۦ وَأَنَّهُۥٓ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, respond to Allah and His Messenger, being dedicated to the instructions and staying away from what is prohibited, since their is life for you in that. And be aware that Allah has power over everything, and He has power over you; so He is able to hinder you from following the truth after you had rejected it. So you should hurry to comply without delay, and be mindful that you will be gathered to Allah alone on the Day of Judgement, and will be rewarded for the actions that you did in this world."
"Beware of sedition, which does not affect the oppressors alone among you, and know that the punishment of God is severe.",24,8,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ فِتْنَةً لَّا تُصِيبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنكُمْ خَآصَّةً وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"Beware of suffering that does not only reach those who do wrong among you, but reaches you and others as well. This is when disobedience becomes widespread and is not prevented. Be sure that Allah is strong with the punishment for those who go against Him, so beware of opposing Him."
"Remember, when you were few and powerless in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful.",25,8,وَٱذْكُرُوٓا۟ إِذْ أَنتُمْ قَلِيلٌ مُّسْتَضْعَفُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ تَخَافُونَ أَن يَتَخَطَّفَكُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ فَـَٔاوَىٰكُمْ وَأَيَّدَكُم بِنَصْرِهِۦ وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Remember when the believers were in Makkah, and they were few, and the people of Makkah considered them to be weak and overpowered them. They were scared that their enemies would capture them; but Allah brought them together to a safe place, which was Medina, and made them strong, helping them against their enemies on the battlefields, for example at Badr, and giving them good things, among them the war gains they got from their enemies. This was all so that they might be thankful to Allah for His blessings, that He might increase them, and for them not to be ungrateful so that He removes the blessings from them and punishes them."
"O you who believe, do not be faithless to God and His Apostle, nor violate your trusts knowingly.",26,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَخُونُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ وَتَخُونُوٓا۟ أَمَٰنَٰتِكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not betray Allah and His Messenger by disobeying the commands and failing to stay away from the prohibitions. You must not knowingly betray your trusts, such as debts and so on."
"Know that your worldly possessions and your children are just a temptation, and that God has greater rewards with Him.",27,8,وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَآ أَمْوَٰلُكُمْ وَأَوْلَٰدُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُۥٓ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Be aware O believers that your wealth and children are a test for you, and your conduct with them may prevent you from performing good actions for your Afterlife, or lead to betraying your trusts. Know that with Allah is a great reward, so be careful not to lose this reward because of becoming engrossed with them, and you cheating the people because of them."
"O believers, if you follow the path shown by God, He will give you a standard (of right and wrong), and overlook your sins, and forgive you. God is abounding in benevolence.",28,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن تَتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"O you who believe in Allah and His messengers, know that if you are Mindful, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, He will give you the ability to discriminate between truth and falsehood, so you will not be confused as regards to them, and He will erase from you the evil you have committed, and forgive your sins. To Allah belongs immense bounty, and from His great bounty is His Paradise which He has prepared for those who are Mindful among His creation."
"Remember, when the infidels contrived to make you a prisoner or to murder or expel you, they plotted, but God also planned; and God's plan is the best.",29,8,وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلْمَٰكِرِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when the idolaters joined forces against you, plotting to kill or imprison you, or to drive you out of your homeland to another place. They plotted, and Allah turned their plot upon themselves, and Allah plans, and He is the best of planners."
"When Our messages were read out to them, they said: ""We have heard. We could certainly compose (writings) like them if we choose. They are but only tales of long ago.""",30,8,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا قَالُوا۟ قَدْ سَمِعْنَا لَوْ نَشَآءُ لَقُلْنَا مِثْلَ هَٰذَآ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"If Allah’s words are recited to them, they say – stubborn against the truth, considering themselves above it, and disbelieving – that they have heard something similar before, and that if they wanted to say something similar to the Qur’ān they could, saying that the Qur’ān is just the fables of earlier peoples."
"They had also said: ""If this be the truth from you, O God, then rain down on us stones from the skies, or inflict a grievous punishment upon us.""",31,8,وَإِذْ قَالُوا۟ ٱللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَٰذَا هُوَ ٱلْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَوِ ٱئْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Remember when the idolaters said to Allah that if what Muhammad brought was true, then He should rain rocks down from the sky to destroy them, or bring them a painful punishment. They said this going to extremes in their denial and rejection."
"But God would not choose to punish them while you are in their midst, nor afflict them when they are seeking forgiveness.",32,8,وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ مُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ,"But Allah would not punish your nation O Muhammad, with a punishment that destroyed them while you are living among them, for you living among them keeps them safe from this punishment. And Allah would not punish them as long as they asked Him for forgiveness for their sins."
"But what is there so special they have that God should not punish them when they obstruct people from the Holy Mosque, though they are not its (appointed) guardians? Its guardians could be only those who are pious and devout. But most of them do not know.",33,8,وَمَا لَهُمْ أَلَّا يُعَذِّبَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَمَا كَانُوٓا۟ أَوْلِيَآءَهُۥٓ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"What prevents them being punished when they have unjustly stopped people from performing both the circling (ţawāf) and the prayer in the Sacred Mosque – actions deserving of punishment? The idolaters are not Allah’s allies. The allies of Allah are only those who are mindful of Him by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Most of the idolaters do not know this, as they claim they are Allah’s allies when they are not."
Their worship in the House of God has been no more than whistling and clapping. So they have to taste the punishment for disbelief.,34,8,وَمَا كَانَ صَلَاتُهُمْ عِندَ ٱلْبَيْتِ إِلَّا مُكَآءً وَتَصْدِيَةً فَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,"The prayer of the idolaters at the Sacred Mosque was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste, O idolaters, the punishment of being killed or taken prisoner on the day of Badr because of your disbelief in Allah and rejection of His Messenger."
"Those who disbelieve spend their possessions on turning men away from God. They will go on spending and rue it in the end, and will be subdued. But those who remain disbelievers shall be gathered into Hell",35,8,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ لِيَصُدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَسَيُنفِقُونَهَا ثُمَّ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسْرَةً ثُمَّ يُغْلَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ يُحْشَرُونَ,"Disbelievers in Allah spend their wealth to prevent people from Allah’s religion, but they will not achieve their goal. The end result of their spending of wealth in this way will be sadness, because they will lose their wealth and fail in their goal; and then they will be defeated by the believers. Disbelievers in Allah will be driven to Hell on the Day of Judgement and will enter it to live there eternally."
"That God may separate the bad from the good, and link the wicked together and cast them into Hell. These are verily the people who will lose.",36,8,لِيَمِيزَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِ وَيَجْعَلَ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بَعْضَهُۥ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فَيَرْكُمَهُۥ جَمِيعًا فَيَجْعَلَهُۥ فِى جَهَنَّمَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Disbelievers who spend their wealth to prevent people from the path of Allah will be driven to the fire of Hell, so that Allah may isolate the wicked group of disbelievers from the pure group of believers, and so that He may place bad people, actions and wealth on top of one another in a pile and place them in the fire of Hell. They are the losers, because they will lose their souls and their families on the Day of Judgement."
"You tell the unbelievers in case they desist whatever has happened will be forgiven them. If they persist, they should remember the fate of those who have gone before them.",37,8,قُل لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِن يَنتَهُوا۟ يُغْفَرْ لَهُم مَّا قَدْ سَلَفَ وَإِن يَعُودُوا۟ فَقَدْ مَضَتْ سُنَّتُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"Say, O Messenger, to those of your people who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger that if they stop disbelieving in Allah and His Messenger and preventing the believers from Allah’s path, then Allah will forgive their past sins, because Islam wipes out what is before it; but if they return to their disbelief, then Allah’s way of dealing with earlier people has already come as a warning: when they rejected and continued in their disbelief, He swiftly punished them."
"So, fight them till all opposition ends, and obedience is wholly God's. If they desist then verily God sees all they do.",38,8,وَقَٰتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ ٱلدِّينُ كُلُّهُۥ لِلَّهِ فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"O believers, fight your disbelieving enemies until there is no more idolatry or Muslims being stopped from Allah’s religion, when religion and obedience is for Allah alone without any partner being put alongside Him. If the disbelievers stop their idolatry and preventing Muslims from Allah’s religion, then leave them, because Allah sees what they do and nothing is hidden from Him."
"But if they are obstinate, know that God is your helper and protector: How excellent a helper, and how excellent a protector is He!",39,8,وَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ نِعْمَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ ٱلنَّصِيرُ,"If they turn away from the order to leave disbelief and preventing others from Allah’s religion, then be certain, O believers, that Allah will help you against them. What an excellent protector He is for the one He protects, and what an excellent helper He is for the one He helps! Whoever He protects will be successful and whoever He helps will be victorious."
"Know that one-fifth of what you acquire as booty (of war) is for God and His Apostle, and for relatives and orphans, the poor and wayfarers, if you truly believe in God and what We revealed to Our votary on the day of victory over the infidels when the two armies clashed (at Badr). For God has the power to do any thing.",40,8,وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُۥ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءَامَنتُم بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْفُرْقَانِ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Know, O believers, that whatever you take by force from the disbelievers when striving in Allah’s path shall be divided into five. Four-fifths shall be distributed to those who strove in Allah’s path and the remaining fifth shall be further divided into five portions and distributed equally between the following: Allah and His Messenger, to be spent on the general expenses of the Muslims; the relatives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the Children of Hāshim and the Children of Al-Muţţalib; orphans; the poor and destitute; and travellers who are stranded. Obey this if you have faith in Allah and what He revealed to His servant, Muhammad (peace be upon him), on the day of the Battle of Badr, when Allah made a clear distinction between truth and falsehood by giving you victory over your enemies."
"(That day) when you were at one end of the valley, (the unbelievers) at the other, and the caravan below you (on the lowland by the coast), you would surely have declined to fight if (the Makkans) had offered you battle. (But the battle did take place) that God may end the matter which had been accomplished, so that he who had to die may perish after a clear demonstration, and he who had to live may survive in the light of positive proof, for God hears all and knows everything.",41,8,إِذْ أَنتُم بِٱلْعُدْوَةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُم بِٱلْعُدْوَةِ ٱلْقُصْوَىٰ وَٱلرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدتُّمْ لَٱخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِى ٱلْمِيعَٰدِ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَقْضِىَ ٱللَّهُ أَمْرًا كَانَ مَفْعُولًا لِّيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَنۢ بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَىٰ مَنْ حَىَّ عَنۢ بَيِّنَةٍ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Remember, O believers, when you were on the near side of the valley that was facing Medina, the idolaters were on the far side that was facing Makkah and the caravan was at a spot lower than you facing the Red Sea. If you and the idolaters made an appointment with each other to meet at Badr, neither of you would have kept to it: your lack of numbers as compared to your enemy would have kept you back, and the fear of facing Allah’s Messenger would have kept them back. But Allah, may He be glorified, gathered you at Badr without an appointment, so that He may carry out a matter that was already determined: the victory of the believers and the defeat of the disbelievers – bringing honour to His religion and humiliation to idolatry. This was so that those who died from amongst them would die after evidence was established by the believers’ victory against them, despite their lack of numbers and preparation, and so that those who lived would live with clear evidences that Allah made obvious to them, and no one would have any evidence against Allah that they could use as an argument. Allah hears the statements of everyone and knows their actions. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will repay them for that."
"God showed (the Makkans) to be few in your dream, for if He had shown them to be many you would surely have lost courage and disagreed about the (wisdom) of the battle. But God spared you this, for He surely knows what is in the hearts of men.",42,8,إِذْ يُرِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِى مَنَامِكَ قَلِيلًا وَلَوْ أَرَىٰكَهُمْ كَثِيرًا لَّفَشِلْتُمْ وَلَتَنَٰزَعْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَمْرِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَلَّمَ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Remember, O Messenger, Allah’s favour upon you, and upon the believers, when He showed you a dream in which the idolaters were few in number. You informed the believers about this and they took it as a good sign, and their determination to face the enemy in battle was strengthened. If Allah had shown the idolaters to you to be many, the determination of your Companions would have become weak and they would have become afraid of fighting. But Allah saved you all from that and protected them from losing courage. He therefore made them seem few in number in the eye of His Messenger (peace be upon him). He knows what the hearts contain and what the souls hide."
"When you faced them He made (the enemy) seem few to you in numbers, and made you appear fewer in their eyes, (it was) so that God could accomplish what had been decreed; for all things rest with God.",43,8,وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ ٱلْتَقَيْتُمْ فِىٓ أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلًا وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِىٓ أَعْيُنِهِمْ لِيَقْضِىَ ٱللَّهُ أَمْرًا كَانَ مَفْعُولًا وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"Remember, O believers, when Allah showed the idolaters to you, when you met them, as few and made you bravely go forward towards fighting them; and He made you seem few in their eyes, so that they came forward to fight you, without thinking of leaving. This was so that Allah could bring about a matter that was predetermined by taking retribution from the idolaters by them being killed or taken prisoners, and by favouring the believers with victory and defeat of their enemies. All matters are returned to Allah alone and He will repay the one who does evil for his wrongdoing and the one who does good for his good deeds."
"O believers, when you meet an army, stand firm, and think of God a great deal that you may be blessed with success.",44,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا لَقِيتُمْ فِئَةً فَٱثْبُتُوا۟ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, when you fight against a group of disbelievers be patient when you meet them and do not become cowardly. Remember Allah much and call on Him, because He is the One Who can help you against them; and pray to Him to grant you what you desire and protect you from what you fear."
"Obey God and His Apostle, and do not disagree among yourselves or you will be unmanned and lose courage. Persevere, for God is with those who endure.",45,8,وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَلَا تَنَٰزَعُوا۟ فَتَفْشَلُوا۟ وَتَذْهَبَ رِيحُكُمْ وَٱصْبِرُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Observe Allah’s obedience and the obedience of His Prophet in all of your statements, actions and circumstances. Do not argue with one another because dispute leads to weakness, cowardliness and the diminishing of your strength. Be patient when facing the enemy because Allah supports and assists the patient. Whoever Allah is with will definitely be victorious."
"Do not be like those who went out of their homes full of their own importance, ostentatiously, trying to hinder others from the way of God. But God encompasses all they do.",46,8,وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِهِم بَطَرًا وَرِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,"Do not be like those idolaters who left Makkah full of pride, showing off to people, and who prevent people from Allah’s religion and stop them from entering into it. Allah is All-Aware of what they do. No action of theirs is hidden from Him and He will repay them for that."
"Satan made their deeds look alluring to them, and said: ""None will prevail over you this day, for I shall be near at hand."" Yet when the two armies appeared face to face, he turned back and fled, saying: ""I am not with you, for I can see what you cannot perceive. I fear God, for His punishment is severe.""",47,8,وَإِذْ زَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ وَقَالَ لَا غَالِبَ لَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَإِنِّى جَارٌ لَّكُمْ فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَتِ ٱلْفِئَتَانِ نَكَصَ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَقَالَ إِنِّى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّنكُمْ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰ مَا لَا تَرَوْنَ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"Remember, O believers, Allah’s favour on you when Satan made the actions of the idolaters seem good to them and encouraged them to face the Muslims in battle by saying to them, ‘No one can defeat you today because I am your supporter and I will protect you from your enemy’. When the two parties – the believers who had the angels as their support and the idolaters who had Satan who was going to desert them – met, Satan turned back fleeing and said to the idolaters: I have nothing to do with you. I can see the angels who have come to support the believers and I am afraid that Allah will destroy me. Allah’s punishment is harsh and no one is able to bear it."
"The hypocrites, and those who had doubts in their hearts, said: ""Their faith has misled them."" But whoever places his trust in God will find God mighty and wise.",48,8,إِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ غَرَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ دِينُهُمْ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Remember when the hypocrites and those of weak faith were saying: The religion of these people – which promised them victory over their enemies despite their lack of numbers and preparation as compared to the huge number and the strength of their enemies – has deceived them. They have not understood that the person who places reliance upon Allah alone and who has faith in the victory that Allah has promised, Allah will assist such a person and will never desert them no matter how weak they may be. Allah is Mighty and no one can overcome Him. He is Wise in His decree and sacred laws."
"If you could only see the infidels as the angels draw away their souls and strike their faces and their backs, (saying): ""Taste the torment of burning",49,8,وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَٰرَهُمْ وَذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,"If only you, O Messenger, could see those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers at the time when the angels remove their souls, striking their faces when they face towards them and striking their backs when they try to run away, and saying to them: Taste, O disbelievers, the burning punishment! If you had to see that, you would see a serious heart-wrenching sight."
"For what you have brought upon yourselves."" God is surely not unjust to His creatures, (they are unjust to themselves).",50,8,ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,"The cause of that painful punishment at the time when your souls are taken out and the burning punishment in your graves and in the Afterlife is because of the evil actions you performed in the world. Allah does not wrong people, but passes judgement on them with fairness. He is not unjust to His slaves."
"Their case is like that of Pharaoh's people, and of those before them, who denied the revelations of God, and were punished for their sins by God, and God is all powerful and Severe His punishment.",51,8,كَدَأْبِ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"These disbelievers were not the only ones to be punished this way; rather, it is Allah’s way of dealing with disbelievers in every time and place. The people of Pharaoh and the communities before them were also punished like this when they disbelieved in Allah’s words. Allah punished them for their sins with His might and power. Allah is Strong and cannot be overpowered or defeated. His punishment for those who go against Him is severe."
"God does not withdraw a favour bestowed upon a people unless they change themselves, for God hears all and knows everything.",52,8,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمْ يَكُ مُغَيِّرًا نِّعْمَةً أَنْعَمَهَا عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُوا۟ مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"That severe punishment is because when Allah favours a people, He does not take it away from them until they change themselves from their pure state of faith, righteousness and gratitude to a bad state of disbelief in Allah, sin and ingratitude – Allah hears the statements of His servants and knows about their actions; nothing is hidden from Him."
"This was the case with the people of Pharaoh and those before them, who rejected the signs of their Lord and were destroyed for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as they were oppressors.",53,8,كَدَأْبِ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَهْلَكْنَٰهُم بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَآ ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَكُلٌّ كَانُوا۟ ظَٰلِمِينَ,"The case of these disbelievers is like that of others who disbelieved in Allah, such as the people of Pharaoh and the communities who rejected Allah before them. They rejected the verses of their Lord so Allah destroyed them because of the sins they committed. Allah destroyed the people of Pharaoh by causing them to drown in the sea. The people of Pharaoh, as well as the communities before them, were all disobedient because of their disbelief in Allah and their association of partners with Him. They therefore deserved the punishment Allah imposed on them."
"Verily the worst of creatures in the sight of God are those who deny (the truth), and will not believe.",54,8,إِنَّ شَرَّ ٱلدَّوَآبِّ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The worst of those who walk on the earth are those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and who would not believe even if every sign was to come to them – they would still persist in disbelief. The means of guidance – such as intellect, hearing and sight – are of no use to these people."
"As for those with whom you have made a treaty and who abrogate it every time, and do not fear God,",55,8,ٱلَّذِينَ عَٰهَدتَّ مِنْهُمْ ثُمَّ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَهُمْ فِى كُلِّ مَرَّةٍ وَهُمْ لَا يَتَّقُونَ,"Some of these Jewish disbelievers agreed a treaty to not fight against you, O Messenger, nor support any one else in fighting against you. They, then, break this treaty every time you make it with them. They have no fear of Allah so they do not fulfil their oaths and do not honour the promises taken from them."
"If you meet them in battle, inflict on them such a defeat as would be a lesson for those who come after them, and that they may be warned.",56,8,فَإِمَّا تَثْقَفَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْحَرْبِ فَشَرِّدْ بِهِم مَّنْ خَلْفَهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"If you, O Messenger, face in battle these people who break their pledges, then make a harsh example of them so that others hear about it, take a lesson from that and become afraid of fighting you and supporting your enemies against you."
"If you apprehend treachery from a people (with whom you have a treaty), retaliate by breaking off (relations) with them, for God does not like those who are treacherous.",57,8,وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَٱنۢبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَآءٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْخَآئِنِينَ,"If you, O Messenger, become afraid, due to a sign that becomes obvious to you, that a people with whom you entered into a treaty will betray you and break the treaty, then inform them that the treaty is cancelled, so that they are not unjustly disadvantaged. Do not attack them suddenly without informing them, because doing so will be treachery on your part and Allah does not love those who are treacherous. Instead, He detests such people, so be careful of treachery."
The infidels should not think that they can bypass (the law of God). Surely they cannot get away.,58,8,وَلَا يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ سَبَقُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُمْ لَا يُعْجِزُونَ,"The disbelievers should not think that they have escaped from Allah’s punishment, because they cannot do so. Instead, it will surely fall upon them."
"Prepare against them whatever arms and cavalry you can muster, that you may strike terror in (the hearts of) the enemies of God and your own, and others besides them not known to you, but known to God. Whatever you spend in the way of God will be paid back to you in full, and no wrong will be done to you.",59,8,وَأَعِدُّوا۟ لَهُم مَّا ٱسْتَطَعْتُم مِّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رِّبَاطِ ٱلْخَيْلِ تُرْهِبُونَ بِهِۦ عَدُوَّ ٱللَّهِ وَعَدُوَّكُمْ وَءَاخَرِينَ مِن دُونِهِمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُهُمْ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِن شَىْءٍ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تُظْلَمُونَ,"Prepare, O believers, whatever numbers and war equipment you are able to, including keeping trained horses to be used in Allah’s path, so you can frighten Allah’s enemies and your enemies from among the disbelievers who are eagerly waiting for you to be afflicted with a disaster. You can also frighten others whom you do not know of and whose hidden hatred you are not aware of. Allah alone knows them and He knows what they keep hidden inside themselves. Any wealth you spend, whether a little or much, Allah will replace it for you in this world and will give you the reward for it in full in the Afterlife without any reduction. So hurry towards spending in His path."
"But if they are inclined to peace, make peace with them, and have trust in God, for He hears all and knows everything.",60,8,وَإِن جَنَحُوا۟ لِلسَّلْمِ فَٱجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"If they incline to a truce to give up fighting, then, O Messenger, do the same: enter into a truce with them and place your reliance and faith in Allah, because He will never desert you. He is the One Who hears your statements and knows your intentions and actions."
"If they try to cheat you, God is surely sufficient for you. It is He who has strengthened you with His help and with believers",61,8,وَإِن يُرِيدُوٓا۟ أَن يَخْدَعُوكَ فَإِنَّ حَسْبَكَ ٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِۦ وَبِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"If, by inclining to a truce, their goal is to deceive you, O Messenger, so that they can prepare to fight you, then Allah is sufficient for you against their plot and deception. It is He Who strengthened you with His help and with those Emigrants and Helpers who have faith in you."
"Whose hearts He cemented with love. You could never have united their hearts even if you had spent whatever (wealth) is in the earth; but God united them with love, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.",62,8,وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ لَوْ أَنفَقْتَ مَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مَّآ أَلَّفْتَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"He brought the hearts of the believers, with whom He assisted you, together after they were disunited. If you had spent all the wealth on earth to bring their disunited hearts together, you would not have been able to do so. But Allah alone brought them together. He is Mighty in His dominion and nothing can overpower Him. He is Wise in His decree, handling of affairs and sacred laws."
"God is sufficient for you, O Prophet, and the faithful who follow you.",63,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ حَسْبُكَ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for you against the evil of your enemies and He is sufficient for the believers who are with you. So trust in Allah and rely on Him."
"O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers, for they are people devoid of understanding.",64,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ حَرِّضِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقِتَالِ إِن يَكُن مِّنكُمْ عِشْرُونَ صَٰبِرُونَ يَغْلِبُوا۟ مِا۟ئَتَيْنِ وَإِن يَكُن مِّنكُم مِّا۟ئَةٌ يَغْلِبُوٓا۟ أَلْفًا مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ,"O Prophet, urge the believers on to fight and encourage them to do so with words that will strengthen their determination and lift their spirits. If there are among you, O believers, twenty who are patient in fighting against the disbelievers, they will overcome two hundred of the disbelievers. And if there are among you one hundred who are patient, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers. That is because the disbelievers are a people who do not understand Allah’s custom of aiding His friends and defeating His enemies. They do not realise the goal of fighting and they therefore only fight in order to gain supremacy in the world."
"God has lightened your burden as He knows you are weak: So, if there are a hundred men of firm determination among you, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you they will vanquish two thousand by the will of God, for God is with those who are determined.",65,8,ٱلْـَٰٔنَ خَفَّفَ ٱللَّهُ عَنكُمْ وَعَلِمَ أَنَّ فِيكُمْ ضَعْفًا فَإِن يَكُن مِّنكُم مِّا۟ئَةٌ صَابِرَةٌ يَغْلِبُوا۟ مِا۟ئَتَيْنِ وَإِن يَكُن مِّنكُمْ أَلْفٌ يَغْلِبُوٓا۟ أَلْفَيْنِ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Now Allah has lightened the burden from you, O believers, since He knows your weakness. He has lightened your burden out of His grace and has made it a duty that one of you remains patient against two disbelievers instead of ten. So if there are one hundred among you who remain patient in fighting against the disbelievers, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one thousand among you who remain patient, they will defeat two thousand of the disbelievers with Allah’s permission. Allah, with His support and assistance, is with those believers who remain patient."
"No apostle should take captives until he has battled and subdued the country. You desire the vanities of this world, but God wills (for you the reward) of the world to come; and God is all-mighty and all-wise.",66,8,مَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُۥٓ أَسْرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يُثْخِنَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ تُرِيدُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"It is not right for a prophet to take captives from the disbelievers who fight against him until he kills many of them, so that this makes other disbelievers fear fighting him. By taking captives from Badr, O believers, you want to receive ransom, but Allah wants the Afterlife for you, which is gained by making religion victorious and powerful. Allah is Mighty in His essence, His attributes and in His domination. Nothing can overcome Him. He is Wise in His decree and sacred laws."
"Had this not been decreed by God in advance, you would have suffered a grievous punishment for what you took (as booty).",67,8,لَّوْلَا كِتَٰبٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَآ أَخَذْتُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Were it not for a decree from Allah – in which it had already been decided that He would make the gains of war lawful for you and permit you to ransom captives – a severe punishment from Allah would have afflicted you because of the gains of war and ransom you took from the captives at Badr before the coming of revelation from Allah that permitted it.
"But now use such of the spoils as are lawful and good, and fear God, for God is forgiving and kind.",68,8,فَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا غَنِمْتُمْ حَلَٰلًا طَيِّبًا وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"So consume, O believers, of the gains of war that you take from the disbelievers because it is lawful for you. Be mindful of Allah by following His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate towards His believing servants."
"O Prophet, tell the captives you have taken: ""If God finds some good in your hearts, He will reward you with something better than was taken away from you, and forgive your sins, for God is forgiving and kind.""",69,8,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ قُل لِّمَن فِىٓ أَيْدِيكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَسْرَىٰٓ إِن يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ خَيْرًا يُؤْتِكُمْ خَيْرًا مِّمَّآ أُخِذَ مِنكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O Prophet, say to those idolater captives who have come into your hands after the Battle of Badr: If Allah knows of any good intentions in your hearts, He will give you something better than the ransom that was taken from you; so do not grieve over what was taken from you. Allah will also forgive your sins because He is Forgiving and Compassionate to those of His servants who repent to Him. This promise of Allah was fullfilled for ‘Abbās, the uncle of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and for others like him who accepted Islam after being captured."
"If they try to deceive you, remember they have deceived God before. So He gave you mastery over them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",70,8,وَإِن يُرِيدُوا۟ خِيَانَتَكَ فَقَدْ خَانُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن قَبْلُ فَأَمْكَنَ مِنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"If their goal, O Muhammad, is to betray you by the words they utter, then they have betrayed Allah previously and Allah gave you victory over them when some of them were killed and others were taken captive. They should therefore wait for something similar to happen if they return to their evil. Allah knows about His creation and what is best for them, and He is Wise in His handling of affairs."
"Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God wealth and soul, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are friends of one another. You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so. In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith, you are duty bound to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty; for God sees all that you do.",71,8,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَهَاجَرُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاوَوا۟ وَّنَصَرُوٓا۟ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَلَمْ يُهَاجِرُوا۟ مَا لَكُم مِّن وَلَٰيَتِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُوا۟ وَإِنِ ٱسْتَنصَرُوكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ فَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍۭ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُم مِّيثَٰقٌ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Those who believed in Allah, accepted His Messenger, practised His sacred law, emigrated from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, or to a place in which they can worship Allah safely, and strived in Allah’s path by spending their wealth and giving their lives to raise Allah’s Word, and those who hosted them in their homes and supported them – those emigrants and those locals who supported them are friends of one another in terms of providing support and assistance. As for those who believed in Allah but did not emigrate from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, you have no obligation, O believers, to support and protect them until they emigrate in Allah’s path. If the disbelievers oppress them and they seek your help, then help them against their enemies, unless there is a pact between you and their enemy that is still in place. Allah sees what you do. No action of yours is hidden from Him and He will repay you for them."
Those who are infidels aid one another. Unless you do the same there will be discord in the land and anarchy.,72,8,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ إِلَّا تَفْعَلُوهُ تَكُن فِتْنَةٌ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَفَسَادٌ كَبِيرٌ,"The disbelievers are united in their disbelief and they therefore become friends of one another. A believer should not become friends with them. If you do not become friends with the believers and oppose the disbelievers, the believers will suffer weakness as a result of a lack of support and there will be great corruption on earth as people will be prevented from Allah’s path."
"Those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes, and struggled in the cause of God, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are veritably true believers. For them is forgiveness and noble sustenance.",73,8,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَهَاجَرُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاوَوا۟ وَّنَصَرُوٓا۟ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقًّا لَّهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Those who believed in Allah and emigrated in His path, and those who provided shelter and assistance to the emigrants in Allah’s path, they are the ones who can be truly described as having faith. They will receive Allah’s forgiveness for their sins and a generous reward: Paradise."
"Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought by your side, are your brothers; yet those who are related by blood are closer to one another according to the decree of God. Verily God knows everything.",74,8,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدُ وَهَاجَرُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ مَعَكُمْ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مِنكُمْ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۢ,"Those who believed and accepted the faith amongst the earlier Emigrants and Helpers, who emigrated from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, and strived in Allah’s path so that Allah’s Word may be the highest and the word of the disbelievers may be the lowest – they are part of you, O believers. They will have the same rights and obligations as you have. Under Allah’s final sacred laws of inheritance, family members are closer to one another than the previous Islamic system of inheritance based on faith and emigration. Allah knows everything. Nothing is hidden from Him. He knows what is best for His servants and legislates what is in their well being."
IMMUNITY is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty.,0,9,بَرَآءَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦٓ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ عَٰهَدتُّم مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"This is a declaration of dissociation from Allah and His Messenger and an announcement of the termination of the treaties that you, O Muslims, had made with the idolaters."
"(They can) move about for four months freely in the land, but should know they cannot escape (the law of) God, and that God can put the unbelievers to shame.",1,9,فَسِيحُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِى ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْزِى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"So travel freely - O idolaters - on earth for a period of four months after which there will be no treaty nor any indemnity. Be certain that you will never escape Allah’s punishment and retribution if you continue to disbelieve in Him. Also be certain that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers, by their being killed or taken captive in the world, and by their entering the fire on the Day of Rising. This includes those who broke their treaties as well as those who had open treaties without any fixed period. As for those with whom you made a treaty for a fixed period their treaty will be honoured until the end of the specified period, even if this is longer than four months."
"A general proclamation is (made) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle, that God is not bound (by any contract) to idolaters, nor is His Apostle. It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God. So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,",2,9,وَأَذَٰنٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦٓ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَجِّ ٱلْأَكْبَرِ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَرِىٓءٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَرَسُولُهُۥ فَإِن تُبْتُمْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِى ٱللَّهِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"A notification from Allah and His Messenger to all people on the Day of Sacrifice that Allah, may He be glorified, and His Messenger are free of the idolaters. If you, O idolaters, repent from your idolatry, then such repentance will be better for you. If you turn away from repentance, then be certain that you will never get away from Allah and you will never escape His punishment. O Messenger, give the disbelievers news that will upset them: the painful punishment that awaits them."
"Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves.",3,9,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ عَٰهَدتُّم مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَنقُصُوكُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَلَمْ يُظَٰهِرُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ أَحَدًا فَأَتِمُّوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ عَهْدَهُمْ إِلَىٰ مُدَّتِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"The idolaters who are excluded from the previous ruling are those with whom you entered into a treaty and they honoured the treaty in full. So there will be a complete fulfilment of the treaty with them until the end of the period. Allah loves those who are mindful of Him by obeying His sacred law, which includes fulfilment of treaties, and by avoiding His prohibitions, which include the prohibition of treachery."
"But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.",4,9,فَإِذَا ٱنسَلَخَ ٱلْأَشْهُرُ ٱلْحُرُمُ فَٱقْتُلُوا۟ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱحْصُرُوهُمْ وَٱقْعُدُوا۟ لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ فَإِن تَابُوا۟ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَوُا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ فَخَلُّوا۟ سَبِيلَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"With the ending of the sacred months (Dhū Al-Qa‘dah, Dhū Al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram and Rajab), during which you assured your enemies of safety, kill the idolaters wherever you meet them. Besiege them in their fortresses and lie in wait for them on their paths. If they repent to Allah from their idolatry, establish the prayer and give the Zakat from their wealth, they become your brothers in Islam and you must not fight them any longer. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate towards those of His servants who repent to Him."
"If an idolater seeks protection, then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to a place of safety, for they are people who do not know.",5,9,وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ ٱسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ حَتَّىٰ يَسْمَعَ كَلَٰمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُۥ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ,"If any of the idolaters, whose blood and wealth is permissible, comes to you, O Messenger, and requests your protection, then accept their request so that they can listen to the Qur’ān. Then take them to a place where they will be safe. That is because the disbelievers are a people who do not know the realities of this religion. When they come to know of it by listening to the recitation of the Qur’ān, they may come on to the right path."
"How could there be a treaty between idolaters and God and His Apostle, except those you covenanted by the Sacred Mosque? Therefore as long as they are honest with you be correct with them, for God loves those who are godly.",6,9,كَيْفَ يَكُونُ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ عَهْدٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعِندَ رَسُولِهِۦٓ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ عَٰهَدتُّمْ عِندَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ فَمَا ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ لَكُمْ فَٱسْتَقِيمُوا۟ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"It is not correct for those who associate partners with Allah to have a treaty and an assurance of protection from Allah and His Messenger, except for the treaty you made with those idolaters at the Sacred Mosque in the Treaty of Al-Ḥudaybiyyah. As long as they uphold the treaty with you and do not break it, then you should also not break it. Allah loves those of His servants who are mindful of Him by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"How (can they be trusted)? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you. They flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse to you, for most of them are iniquitous.",7,9,كَيْفَ وَإِن يَظْهَرُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ لَا يَرْقُبُوا۟ فِيكُمْ إِلًّا وَلَا ذِمَّةً يُرْضُونَكُم بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَتَأْبَىٰ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"How can they have a treaty with you and an assurance of protection when they are your enemies? If they gain the upper hand over you they will not be mindful of Allah in relation to you, nor will they respect any relationship or any treaty. Instead, they will impose the worst punishment on you. They please you with fancy speech uttered by their tongues, but their hearts do not agree with their tongues. They will not fulfil what they promise and most of them deviate from following Allah by breaking the treaty."
"They barter away the words of God for a petty price, and obstruct (others) from His path. How evil indeed are the things they do!",8,9,ٱشْتَرَوْا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا فَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"In order to satisfy their passions and desires, they took a trivial price of the things of this world in exchange for following Allah’s words, which includes fulfilment of treaties. They prevented themselves from following the truth and they turned away from it. They also prevented others from the truth. Such actions are most certainly evil."
"They have no regard for kinship or treaties with believers, for they are transgressors.",9,9,لَا يَرْقُبُونَ فِى مُؤْمِنٍ إِلًّا وَلَا ذِمَّةً وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُعْتَدُونَ,"Due to their hatred, they do not have any consideration for Allah in how they deal with the believers, nor do they respect any relationship or treaty. They overstep Allah’s limits because they are oppressive and hostile."
"But if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat, then they are your brothers in faith. We explain Our commands distinctly for those who understand.",10,9,فَإِن تَابُوا۟ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَوُا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ فَإِخْوَٰنُكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَنُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"If they repent to Allah from their disbelief, pronounce the two declarations of faith, establish the prayer, give the Zakat of their wealth, then they will become Muslims and they will be your brothers in religion. They will then have the same rights and duties as you and it will not be lawful for you to fight them. Their acceptance of Islam will protect their lives, wealth and honour. Allah explains the verses clearly to a people who know, as they are the ones who will benefit from them and will cause others to benefit as well."
"If they break their pledge after giving their word and revile your faith, fight these specimens of faithlessness, for surely their oaths have no sanctity: They may haply desist.",11,9,وَإِن نَّكَثُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ عَهْدِهِمْ وَطَعَنُوا۟ فِى دِينِكُمْ فَقَٰتِلُوٓا۟ أَئِمَّةَ ٱلْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَآ أَيْمَٰنَ لَهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَنتَهُونَ,"If these idolaters, with whom you entered into a treaty not to fight for a set period, break their oaths and promises and insult your religion and attack it, then fight them, because they are the leaders of disbelief and there are no treaties or promises that can protect their lives. Fight them in the hope that they will stop their disbelief, violation of their treaties and speaking badly of the religion."
"Will you not fight those who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the Apostle, and who were the first to attack you? Are you afraid of them? If you are believers you should fear God more.",12,9,أَلَا تُقَٰتِلُونَ قَوْمًا نَّكَثُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَهُمْ وَهَمُّوا۟ بِإِخْرَاجِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَهُم بَدَءُوكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ أَتَخْشَوْنَهُمْ فَٱللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَوْهُ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Why do you, O believers, not fight a people who have broken their treaties and promises and who have attempted, in their meeting at Dār Al-Nadwah, to expel the Messenger (peace be upon him) from Makkah? They started the fight against you in the first place when they assisted the Children of Bakr, who were the allies of the Quraysh, against the Children of Khuzā‘ah, who were the allies of the Messenger (peace be upon him). Is it because you are afraid of them that you do not go forward to fight them? It is Allah, may He be glorified, that you should fear, if you are truly believers."
"Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands, and put them to shame, and help you against them, and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers,",13,9,قَٰتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Fight then O believers, the idolaters, so that Allah may punish them by your hands by you killing, humiliating, defeating and capturing them. He also wants to help you making you overcome the idolaters and to heal the hearts of a believing people who had not seen fighting, through the believers killing, capturing, defeating and overcoming their enemies."
And remove the anger from their breasts; for God turns to whosoever desires. God is all-knowing and all-wise.,14,9,وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"In this way, He will also remove the anger in the hearts of His believing servants by giving them victory. Allah turns in mercy to whomever He wills among those who were stubborn, if they repent to Him, asking for forgiveness. The last part of this verse describes the case of some of the people of Makkah on the day it was conquered by the Muslims. Allah knows the truth about those who repent to Him, and is Wise in His creation and His administration and law-giving."
"Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God, His Apostle and the faithful, as their friends? God is cognisant of all that you do.",15,9,أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تُتْرَكُوا۟ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَٰهَدُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا رَسُولِهِۦ وَلَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلِيجَةً وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Do the believers think that Allah would leave them without testing them? Testing is one of Allah’s customs, and they will be tested until Allah clearly proves those who strive with sincerity for Him, who do not take protectors apart from Allah, His Messenger and the believers, and do not make intimate friends with the disbelievers. Allah is aware of everything you do – nothing is hidden from Him – and you will be repaid for your actions."
"The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing testimony to their disbelief. Meaningless will be their acts, and in Hell they will bide for ever,",16,9,مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُوا۟ مَسَٰجِدَ ٱللَّهِ شَٰهِدِينَ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِم بِٱلْكُفْرِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ وَفِى ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ خَٰلِدُونَ,"It is not right for the idolaters to attend or care for Allah’s places of worship, worshipping in them, or doing good actions in them, while confirming their disbelief through their displaying of polytheism and the like. Their actions are wasted because they do not have faith, and faith is the condition for actions being accepted. On the Day of Judgement, they will enter the fire of Hell, living in it eternally, unless they repent from idolatry before their death."
"Only those who believe in God and the Last Day, who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and fear no one but God, can visit the mosques of God. They may hope to be among the guided.",17,9,إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَٰجِدَ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَى ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ فَعَسَىٰٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَن يَكُونُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"It is only right that places of worship should be supported and cared for by those who have faith in Allah alone, who do not associate partners with Him, who have faith in the Day of Judgement, who establish the prayer, and give the Zakat from their wealth, and who do not fear anyone except for Allah, glory be to Him. Such people will be guided to the right path, while the idolaters are the farthest away from it."
"Do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the Sacred Mosque, is the same as believing in God and the Last Day, and striving in the cause of God? In the eyes of God it is not the same; and God does not show the unrighteous the way.",18,9,أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ ٱلْحَآجِّ وَعِمَارَةَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ كَمَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَجَٰهَدَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَسْتَوُۥنَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Do the idolaters think that giving water to the pilgrims and caring for the Sacred Mosque is like someone who has faith in Allah, not associating any partners with Him, having faith in the Day of Judgement, striving with their self and their wealth to make the Word of Allah supreme, and the word of the disbelievers lowest? Do they consider them to be equal in virtue before Allah? They will never be equal before Allah, and Allah will not give success to those who do wrong by being idolaters, even if they do good actions, such as giving water to the pilgrims."
"Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful.",19,9,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَهَاجَرُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,"Those who have faith in Allah and emigrate from the lands of disbelief to the lands of Islam, striving for Allah’s sake with their wealth and their selves, have the greatest rank with Allah. Such people will succeed in achieving what they desire, and avoiding what they fear."
"Their Lord announces to them news of His mercy, acceptance, and gardens of lasting bliss",20,9,يُبَشِّرُهُمْ رَبُّهُم بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنْهُ وَرِضْوَٰنٍ وَجَنَّٰتٍ لَّهُمْ فِيهَا نَعِيمٌ مُّقِيمٌ,"Their Lord gives them good news to gladden their hearts, of His mercy and His contentment with them, so that He is never angry with them, and of entering them into gardens in which there is eternal bliss."
Which they will enjoy for ever. Indeed God has greater rewards with Him.,21,9,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُۥٓ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,"They will live in these gardens eternally as a reward for the good actions that they would do in the world. Allah has a great reward for those who follow what He instructs and who stay away from what He has prohibited, who lived in devotion to Him."
"O you who believe, do not hold your fathers and brothers as friends if they hold disbelief more dear than faith; and those of you who do so are iniquitous.",22,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوٓا۟ ءَابَآءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَٰنَكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنِ ٱسْتَحَبُّوا۟ ٱلْكُفْرَ عَلَى ٱلْإِيمَٰنِ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah and follow His Messenger, do not take your fathers and brothers, relatives and other relations, as intimates and protectors, telling them the secrets of the believers and consulting them, if they prefer disbelief to faith in Allah alone. Whoever makes them protectors despite their disbelief, drawing close to them, disobeys Allah, wrongs themselves and brings destruction upon themselves because of their disobedience."
"You tell them: ""If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or the business you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than God, His Apostle, and struggling in His cause, then wait until God's command arrives, for God does not show transgressors the way.""",23,9,قُلْ إِن كَانَ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَآؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَٰنُكُمْ وَأَزْوَٰجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَٰلٌ ٱقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَٰرَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَٰكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَآ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَجِهَادٍ فِى سَبِيلِهِۦ فَتَرَبَّصُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِىَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Say O Messenger to the believers, if their fathers, sons, brothers, wives and relatives, the wealth which they have gained, the trade which they want to grow and fear its reduction, and the houses which they like to live in are more beloved to them than Allah and His Messenger and striving for His sake, then they should wait for the punishment that Allah will send down upon them. Allah does not make it easy for those who disobey Him to do actions which please Him."
"Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated.",24,9,لَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِى مَوَاطِنَ كَثِيرَةٍ وَيَوْمَ حُنَيْنٍ إِذْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ كَثْرَتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تُغْنِ عَنكُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ ثُمَّ وَلَّيْتُم مُّدْبِرِينَ,"Allah helped the believers against their enemies, the idolaters, in many battles, despite their small numbers and shortage of weapons, when they trusted in Allah and took appropriate measures. The believers should not be simply pleased by being a great number, because this is not the reason for them beating their enemy. On the day of Ḥunayn, when they were pleased by their great numbers, they said that they would not be defeated on that day because of small numbers; but their great numbers which pleased them did them no good, with their enemies overcoming them, and the earth becoming narrow for them despite its vastness. Then they turned from their enemies, fleeing in defeat."
Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels. This is the recompense of those who do not believe.,25,9,ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُۥ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَنزَلَ جُنُودًا لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَعَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Then, after they ran away from their enemy, Allah sent down calm upon His Messenger and the believers, so that they became patient in fighting; and He sent angels they could not see, and punished the disbelievers with death, capture and seizure of their wealth, women and children. These disbelievers were repaid in this way for their rejection of the Messenger."
"Yet God may turn (even) after this to whomsoever He please, for God is compassionate and kind.",26,9,ثُمَّ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Then whoever rejects disbelief and misguidance after that affliction, Allah will accept their repentance. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to those of His servants who repent to Him, accepting their repentance after their denial of the truth and their disobedience."
"O believers, the idolaters are unclean. So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year. In case you fear indigence (from the stoppage of business with them), then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",27,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ فَلَا يَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ ٱلْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَٰذَا وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِن شَآءَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and follow the sacred law that He established for them, are told that the idolaters are unclean because of their disbelief, disobedience and blameworthy character traits, and evil customs. So they were not to enter the sacred area of Makkah, containing the Sacred Mosque, as pilgrims for the Hajj or Umrah after that year, which was the ninth year of the Hijrah. If the believers fear poverty, because of the idolaters no longer bringing different foods and merchandise, Allah will be sufficient for them from His bounty, if He wills. Allah knows the situation, and is Wise in His plan."
"Fight those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden, nor accept divine law, until all of them pay protective tax in submission.",28,9,قَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَا بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَلَا يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَلَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ ٱلْحَقِّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُوا۟ ٱلْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ صَٰغِرُونَ,"Fight then O believers, against the disbelievers who do not have faith in Allah as their Lord without any partner, do not believe in the Day of Judgement, do not avoid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden (such as carrion, the meat of pigs, alcohol and usury), and who do not submit themselves to what Allah has made sacred law, among the Jews and Christians – until they pay the jizyah tax with their own hands and are humble and subdued."
"The Jews say: ""Ezra is the son of God;"" the Christians say: ""Christ is the son of God."" That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!",29,9,وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عُزَيْرٌ ٱبْنُ ٱللَّهِ وَقَالَتِ ٱلنَّصَٰرَى ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ قَوْلُهُم بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ يُضَٰهِـُٔونَ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ قَٰتَلَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"The Jews and the Christians associate partners with Allah: the Jews do so by claiming that ‘Uzayr is the son of Allah; and the Christians do so by claiming that the Messiah, Jesus, is the son of Allah. What they say with their own mouths is simply made up without any proof from Allah. By saying such things, they are similar to the idolaters before them, who said that the angels were the daughters of Allah. Allah is far above such things – may Allah destroy them! How can they turn away from the clear truth to falsehood?"
"They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ, son of Mary, to be gods apart from God, even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God, for there is no god but He. Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him!",30,9,ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَٰهًا وَٰحِدًا لَّآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"The Jews made their rabbis lords instead of Allah, as did the Christians with their monks, by allowing them to permit what Allah had forbidden them and forbidding what Allah had allowed for them; and the Christians made the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, a god next to Allah. as well as ‘Uzayr and Jesus the son of Mary, to worship Him alone, and not to associate anything with Him. He, glory be to Him, is the only God, and there is nothing worthy of worship except Him. He is, glory be to Him, sacred, far above having any partner that these idolaters and others claim."
"They wish to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies; but God will not have it so, for He wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers be averse.",31,9,يُرِيدُونَ أَن يُطْفِـُٔوا۟ نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَيَأْبَى ٱللَّهُ إِلَّآ أَن يُتِمَّ نُورَهُۥ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"The disbelievers from all the various religious groups who disbelieve by making up wrong beliefs and rejecting Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), wish to eradicate Islam. So they undermine the clear proofs establishing that there is only one God and that His Messenger has brought the truth. However, Allah will not allow anything to stop His sacred path being perfected and being made clear. He will raise His Religion above everything else, even if the disbelievers hate that, and if Allah wills something, others are powerless to prevent it."
"It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief, even though the idolaters may not like it.",32,9,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُۥ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِۦ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ,"It is Allah, glory be to Him, Who sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him)with the Qur’ān as the guidance for all people and the path of truth – establishing the religion of Islam – so as to raise it above all other religions through its proof, evidence and laws, even if the idolaters hate this."
"O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God. To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment.",33,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلْأَحْبَارِ وَٱلرُّهْبَانِ لَيَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَٰلَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنفِقُونَهَا فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, acting in obedience to the sacred law, are told that many of the Jewish rabbis and the Christian monks unjustly take the wealth of people, through things such as taking bribes, and prevent people from entering the path of Allah; they also collect gold and silver without purifying it by giving charity. The Messenger is told to inform them of the painful punishment that they will be given on the Day of Judgement."
"On the day We shall heat up (their gold) on the fire of Hell and brand their foreheads, sides and backs (and say to them): ""It is this you stored up for yourselves; so now taste of what you had stored!""",34,9,يَوْمَ يُحْمَىٰ عَلَيْهَا فِى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ فَتُكْوَىٰ بِهَا جِبَاهُهُمْ وَجُنُوبُهُمْ وَظُهُورُهُمْ هَٰذَا مَا كَنَزْتُمْ لِأَنفُسِكُمْ فَذُوقُوا۟ مَا كُنتُمْ تَكْنِزُونَ,"On the Day of Judgement, what they hoarded and did not give its right will be heated in the fire of Hell; and when it is greatly heated, it will be placed on their foreheads, sides and backs, then reheated when it cools, on a day lasting fifty thousand years. It will be said to them, by way of blame, that this is the wealth they hoarded for themselves, not paying the Zakat from it, or spending it in the way they were ordered; and they will be told to taste the evil consequences of what they hoarded and did not use correctly."
"The number of months with God is twelve in accordance with God's law since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are holy. This is the straight reckoning. So do not exceed yourselves during them; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner; and remember, God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right.",35,9,إِنَّ عِدَّةَ ٱلشُّهُورِ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ مِنْهَآ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ فَلَا تَظْلِمُوا۟ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَقَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ كَآفَّةً كَمَا يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ كَآفَّةً وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"There are twelve months of the year decreed by Allah, no more or less, which Allah established in the Preserved Tablet when He created the heavens and the earth. Of these twelve months, four are sacred, during which Allah has forbidden fighting. Three of them consecutive (Dhū Al-Qa‘dah, Dhū Al-Ḥijjah and Muḥarram), and one is on its own (Rajab). The twelve months of the year, and respecting the sacredness of four of them, is the correct way of life. Allah tells the believers not to wrong themselves during these sacred months by fighting, violating their sacredness. Also, the believers are instructed to fight the idolaters all together as they fight them all together, and to know that Allah is with those who are Mindful, who follow what He instructs and stay away from what He has prohibited, and He helps and supports them. If Allah supports anyone, no one will be able to defeat them."
"Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way.",36,9,إِنَّمَا ٱلنَّسِىٓءُ زِيَادَةٌ فِى ٱلْكُفْرِ يُضَلُّ بِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يُحِلُّونَهُۥ عَامًا وَيُحَرِّمُونَهُۥ عَامًا لِّيُوَاطِـُٔوا۟ عِدَّةَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ فَيُحِلُّوا۟ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ زُيِّنَ لَهُمْ سُوٓءُ أَعْمَٰلِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Postponing the sacredness of the month of Muḥarram to another month, as the Arabs of the time of ignorance before Islam used to do, was another example of their disbelief and rejection of His laws. Satan led the disbelievers further astray through this, when he made them adopt this evil practice. They would declare a sacred month not to be sacred one year, exchanging it for one of the other months, and honoured its sacredness another year, making up the same number of months that Allah made sacred, but changing which months, in opposition to Allah’s law. Satan made their evil actions seems attractive to them so that they did them, and one such action was postponing sacred months through their invention. Allah does not give success to the disbelievers and those who persist in disbelief."
"What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag? Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come? Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come.",37,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ ٱنفِرُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَرَضِيتُم بِٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا مِنَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ فَمَا مَتَٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and follow His sacred law, what is wrong with you that when you are called to strive for Allah’s sake, fighting against your enemy, tyou become reluctant, desiring to remain in your houses. Do you prefer the passing life of this world and its pleasures, which are short-lived, to the eternal bliss of the Afterlife, which Allah has prepared for those who strive for His sake? The enjoyment of the life of this world is insignificant in comparison to that of the Afterlife. How can anyone with sense choose something passing over something eternal, or something miserable over something amazing?"
"Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things.",38,9,إِلَّا تَنفِرُوا۟ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا وَيَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ وَلَا تَضُرُّوهُ شَيْـًٔا وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"If you do not go forward, striving for the sake of Allah to fight against the enemy, Allah will repay you with defeat and humiliation, and He will replace you with another people who are devoted to Allah, who rush to fight when they are called to do so. You do not harm Him in any way by going against His command, because He has no need of you, while you are in need of Him. Allah has power over all things, nothing weakens Him, and it is easy for Him to make His path and His Prophet triumph without you."
"If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: ""Do not grieve, for God is with us."" Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.",39,9,إِلَّا تَنصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ثَانِىَ ٱثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا فِى ٱلْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَٰحِبِهِۦ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَنَا فَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُۥ عَلَيْهِ وَأَيَّدَهُۥ بِجُنُودٍ لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَجَعَلَ كَلِمَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلسُّفْلَىٰ وَكَلِمَةُ ٱللَّهِ هِىَ ٱلْعُلْيَا وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"If you O believers, do not help the Messenger (peace be upon him) and respond to his call to strive for the sake of Allah, then Allah has already helped him when you were not with him; when the idolaters drove him away from Mecca with Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq (may Allah be pleased with him), and the two of them hid in the cave of Thawr from the disbelievers who were chasing them. On that occasion, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) told his companion Abū Bakr, who was scared that the idolaters would discover him, not to worry, because Allah was with them, supporting and helping them. Allah sent down His reassurance and tranquility upon the heart of His Messenger, and sent angels which they could not see to support them, making the word of the idolaters the lowest, and the word of Allah the highest by aiding His Religion. Allah is Mighty in His essence, power and force – nothing can overcome Him – and He Wise in His planning, decree and laws."
"O believers, go out in the cause of God, (whether) light or heavy, and strive in the service of God, wealth and soul. This is better for you if you understand.",40,9,ٱنفِرُوا۟ خِفَافًا وَثِقَالًا وَجَٰهِدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"March forth O believers, striving for the cause of Allah in hardship and in ease, whether you are young or old, striving with your wealth and selves, because going out and striving with your wealth and your selves is of more benefit in the life of this world and in the Afterlife than sitting at home and becoming attached to your wealth and persons. If you truly know this, then be eager to obey."
"(O Prophet), had the gain been close at hand, and easy the journey, they would surely have followed you; but hard was the journey and long the going. Even then they swear by God (and say): ""If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you."" They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie.",41,9,لَوْ كَانَ عَرَضًا قَرِيبًا وَسَفَرًا قَاصِدًا لَّٱتَّبَعُوكَ وَلَٰكِنۢ بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلشُّقَّةُ وَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَوِ ٱسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ يُهْلِكُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"If the Prophet had called the hypocrites who asked for permission to stay behind to an easy reward and a journey that was not difficult, they would have followed him; but the distance he called them to cover to get to the enemy was too great for them, so they stayed behind. These hypocrites who asked for permission to stay behind would swear by Allah when the Prophet returned to them, saying that if they could have gone out to fight with them they would have done so. They destroy themselves by exposing themselves to Allah’s punishment, because they stayed behind and then swore a lie. Of course, Allah knew they were lying in what they claimed and in what they swore."
May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?,42,9,عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنكَ لِمَ أَذِنتَ لَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا۟ وَتَعْلَمَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"May Allah forgive the Messenger for his decision to permit them to stay behind! Why did he do so before it became apparent to him who had real excuses and who was lying? Then he could have excused those who were telling the truth, not those who were lying."
"Those who believe in God and the Last Day, do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul (in the cause of God), for God knows the pious and devout.",43,9,لَا يَسْتَـْٔذِنُكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ أَن يُجَٰهِدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"It is not the characteristic of those who truly have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgement to ask the Messenger (peace be upon him)for permission to stay behind from striving for Allah’s sake with their wealth and their selves. Rather, it is their characteristic to rally when they are called to fight, and to strive with their wealth and their persons. Allah knows those among His servants who are Mindful, who do not ask to be excused except for genuine reasons that really prevent them from going with the Messenger."
"Only they ask (for leave) who do not believe in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are full of doubt; and doubting they waver (between gain and loss).",44,9,إِنَّمَا يَسْتَـْٔذِنُكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَٱرْتَابَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِى رَيْبِهِمْ يَتَرَدَّدُونَ,"Those who ask the Messenger (peace be upon him)for permission to stay behind from striving for the sake of Allah are the hypocrites who do not believe in Allah and the Day of Judgement, and whose hearts are full of doubt about the sacred path of Allah. In their doubt they waver, confused, and they are not guided to the truth."
"If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: ""Stay at home with those who stay behind.""",45,9,وَلَوْ أَرَادُوا۟ ٱلْخُرُوجَ لَأَعَدُّوا۟ لَهُۥ عُدَّةً وَلَٰكِن كَرِهَ ٱللَّهُ ٱنۢبِعَاثَهُمْ فَثَبَّطَهُمْ وَقِيلَ ٱقْعُدُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ,"If they had been telling the truth in their claim that they wanted to go out with the Messenger (peace be upon him), striving for the sake of Allah, they would have made preparations for it; but Allah did not want them to go with the Prophet, and stopped them from doing so. They were disgraced because they were told to stay behind with those who were ordered to stay behind, such as the women, children and the sick."
"Had they gone out with you, they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord; for there are some in your midst who spy for them. But God knows who are the wicked.",46,9,لَوْ خَرَجُوا۟ فِيكُم مَّا زَادُوكُمْ إِلَّا خَبَالًا وَلَأَوْضَعُوا۟ خِلَٰلَكُمْ يَبْغُونَكُمُ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ وَفِيكُمْ سَمَّٰعُونَ لَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"It was a blessing that these hypocrites did not go with them, because if they had gone they would only have increased them in problems: demoralising people and making them doubt, hurrying between their lines, spreading rumours to divide them. Some of the believers would listen to such lies, believing and repeating them, causing arguments amongst them. Allah knows the wrongdoers among the hypocrites, who try to spread conspiracies and doubts among the believers."
"They had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you, but truth came out in the end and God's will prevailed, even though they did not like it.",47,9,لَقَدِ ٱبْتَغَوُا۟ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ مِن قَبْلُ وَقَلَّبُوا۟ لَكَ ٱلْأُمُورَ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَظَهَرَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَهُمْ كَٰرِهُونَ,"These hypocrites had already tried to cause trouble by creating division amongst the believers before the Battle of Tabūk, by making things difficult for the Messenger (peace be upon him) through their schemes and plots, so that they might affect the Prophet’s determination to fight. This was until the help and support of Allah arrived, and He strengthened His path and overcame His enemies, although they hated this, because they wanted what was false to overcome the truth."
"And (many a one) there is among them who says: ""Allow me (to stay back at home), and put me not on trial."" Surely they have put themselves on trial already, and Hell will enclose the unbelievers from all sides.",48,9,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ ٱئْذَن لِّى وَلَا تَفْتِنِّىٓ أَلَا فِى ٱلْفِتْنَةِ سَقَطُوا۟ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌۢ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Among the hypocrites were those who used various excuses, asking the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to permit them to stay behind from fighting, for fear of being tested by the women of the Roman enemy and hence falling into sin. But they fell into a greater sin than the one they claimed they feared: the sin of hypocrisy, and staying behind. On the Day of Judgement, Hell will surround the disbelievers, none of them escaping it or getting away from it."
"If good comes your way they are vexed, but if calamity befalls you, they say: ""We had taken precautions in advance;"" and pleased, turn away.",49,9,إِن تُصِبْكَ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ وَإِن تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُوا۟ قَدْ أَخَذْنَآ أَمْرَنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَيَتَوَلَّوا۟ وَّهُمْ فَرِحُونَ,"If the Messenger of Allah receives a blessing from Allah that pleases him, such as victory or some gains, they dislike this, and it grieves them. If a misfortune befalls him in the form of some hardship or loss in battle, these hypocrites say that they had taken precautions for themselves, making the right decision when they did not go out to fight as the believers did, which led to them being killed or captured. They, then, turn away to their people, rejoicing in their own safety."
"Tell them: ""Nothing can befall us except what God decrees. Our protector is He, and in God should the faithful place their trust.""",50,9,قُل لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلَّا مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَنَا هُوَ مَوْلَىٰنَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"O Messenger, tell these hypocrites: 'Nothing will afflict us except what Allah has written for us, He is our Protector, the one whom we take refuge in, and we put our trust in Him in all our affairs. Let the believers place their trust in Him for He is sufficient for them and the best of guardians."
"Say: ""Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us, (victory or martyrdom)? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God, direct or through us. So keep waiting; we are waiting with you.""",51,9,قُلْ هَلْ تَرَبَّصُونَ بِنَآ إِلَّآ إِحْدَى ٱلْحُسْنَيَيْنِ وَنَحْنُ نَتَرَبَّصُ بِكُمْ أَن يُصِيبَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِۦٓ أَوْ بِأَيْدِينَا فَتَرَبَّصُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مَعَكُم مُّتَرَبِّصُونَ,"O Messenger, say to them: 'Are you waiting for anything other than victory or martyrdom to befall us – which are both good outcomes – while we expect Allah to send down a misfortune upon you: a punishment from Allah which would destroy you, or that you are punished at our hands with either death or being captured, if Allah permits us to fight against you? Wait to see then what our outcome will be, for we are also waiting to see your outcome.'"
"Tell them: ""You may spend (in the way of God), whether willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you, for you are reprobates.""",52,9,قُلْ أَنفِقُوا۟ طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا لَّن يُتَقَبَّلَ مِنكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ قَوْمًا فَٰسِقِينَ,"Tell them O Messenger, : 'Spend of your wealth willingly or unwillingly, for it will not be accepted from you because of your disbelief and disloyalty to Allah.'"
"Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle, and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly.",53,9,وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَٰتُهُمْ إِلَّآ أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِۦ وَلَا يَأْتُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ إِلَّا وَهُمْ كُسَالَىٰ وَلَا يُنفِقُونَ إِلَّا وَهُمْ كَٰرِهُونَ,"What the hypocrites spend in charity will not be accepted from them due to three matters: their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger; their reluctance and lack of interest in praying; and not spending their wealth willingly, but only unwillingly – because they do not expect to get any benefit from their prayer, or from what they spend."
Do not marvel at their wealth and children. God intends to punish them through these in the world; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.,54,9,فَلَا تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُم بِهَا فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"So do not be impressed by the wealth and children of these hypocrites, or think it to be something good. The end result of their wealth and children will be grievous: Allah will make them a form of punishment for the hypocrites, causing them difficulty and hardship, and send misfortune through them until Allah takes their souls while they still disbelieve; and are given an eternal punishment in the lowest depths of the fire of Hell."
"They swear by God they are with you, though in fact they are not. They are only a frightened lot.",55,9,وَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ وَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ,"The hypocrites swear to the believers, lying to them, that they are with them, when they are secretly not, although they make it look as if they were. But they are a scared people, cowards in fighting, and fear that what happened to the idolaters who were killed and captured will happen to them, so they pretend to be Muslim."
"If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide, they will turn to it.",56,9,لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَـًٔا أَوْ مَغَٰرَٰتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلًا لَّوَلَّوْا۟ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ,"If these hypocrites find a shelter, such as a fort, to protect themselves in, or caves in the mountains to hide in, or an underground tunnel they could go into to shelter in, they would rush away immediately."
"There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God. In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed.",57,9,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَلْمِزُكَ فِى ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ فَإِنْ أُعْطُوا۟ مِنْهَا رَضُوا۟ وَإِن لَّمْ يُعْطَوْا۟ مِنْهَآ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْخَطُونَ,"Among the hypocrites are those who criticise the Messenger for how he distributes charity. If they are given what they want from it, they are happy with the Messenger; but if he does not give them what they want from it, they start to complain."
"They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them, and said: ""God is sufficient for us; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle. We supplicate no one but God.""",58,9,وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ رَضُوا۟ مَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَقَالُوا۟ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ سَيُؤْتِينَا ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَرَسُولُهُۥٓ إِنَّآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ رَٰغِبُونَ,"If only these hypocrites who criticize you in the distribution of charity had been pleased with their portion that Allah had assigned for them and with what the Messenger gave them, saying: 'Allah is sufficient for us and He will grant us more from His Grace, and the Messenger will also give us from what Allah has given him, and we ask Allah alone to enrich us!'-had they said this it would have been better for them then criticising the Messenger."
"Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain. God is all-knowing and all-wise.",59,9,إِنَّمَا ٱلصَّدَقَٰتُ لِلْفُقَرَآءِ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْعَٰمِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَٱلْمُؤَلَّفَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَفِى ٱلرِّقَابِ وَٱلْغَٰرِمِينَ وَفِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Obligatory charity should be distributed to: 1) the poor, those who hardly own anything and this is not hidden from people, either because of the obvious distress of their situation or because of what they tell people about their problems 2) the needy who have some money from working, but not enough for them to live well, whose situation is not drawn attention to; 3) those employed and sent by the Imam to collect it 4) disbelievers, as a sign of friendship, in order to bring them closer to Islam, and those of weak faith, so as to strengthen their faith and prevent evil 5) freeing captives 6) people in debt – who find themselves in debt due to reasonable conditions and not because of extravagance – if they cannot find a way of repaying their debts 7) those striving for the sake of Allah and 8) the traveller who has run out of money. Limiting the distribution of zakat to these people is a duty established by Allah. Allah knows what is in the best interests of His servants, Wise in His planning and law-making."
"There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: ""He listens to everyone."" Tell them: ""He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe. For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment.""",60,9,وَمِنْهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱلنَّبِىَّ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَّكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Among the hypocrites are those who hurt the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) through their words, saying, because of his great kindness, that he listens to everyone and believes whatever they say, and does not distinguish between what is true and what is not. The Messenger (peace be upon him) is told to say to them that he only listens to what is best for them. He has faith in Allah and believes what the believers tell him. Those who harm the Messenger (peace be upon him), in any way, will receive a painful punishment."
They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle.,61,9,يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ لِيُرْضُوكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥٓ أَحَقُّ أَن يُرْضُوهُ إِن كَانُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"The hypocrites swear by Allah to you, O believers, that they did not say anything to hurt the Prophet (peace be upon him). They do this so that you may become pleased with them; but Allah and His Messenger are more deserving of being pleased by their accepting faith and performing good actions, if they are truly believers."
"Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever? And that is the worst disgrace.",62,9,أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُۥ مَن يُحَادِدِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ فَأَنَّ لَهُۥ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدًا فِيهَا ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْخِزْىُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Do these hypocrites not know that by their doing such actions they are opposing Allah and His Messenger; and that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will enter the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement, to live there eternally? That is the worst disgrace and humiliation."
"The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say to them: ""Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread.""",63,9,يَحْذَرُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ أَن تُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُورَةٌ تُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ قُلِ ٱسْتَهْزِءُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا تَحْذَرُونَ,"The hypocrites are afraid that Allah will reveal a sūrah to His Messenger that will inform the believers about the disbelief that they conceal. Say, O Messenger: Continue, O hypocrites, mocking and poking fun. Allah will unveil what you are afraid of by revealing a sūrah or by informing His Messenger about the truth of your case."
"But if you ask them, they will say: ""We were only gossiping and jesting."" You ask them: ""Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?""",64,9,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّمَا كُنَّا نَخُوضُ وَنَلْعَبُ قُلْ أَبِٱللَّهِ وَءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَرَسُولِهِۦ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"If you, O Messenger, ask the hypocrites about the insults they used against the believers after Allah informs you of it, they will say, ‘We were just joking when we said that and we were not serious’. Say, O Messenger, ‘Is it Allah, His verses and His Messenger that you were making fun of?’"
"Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).",65,9,لَا تَعْتَذِرُوا۟ قَدْ كَفَرْتُم بَعْدَ إِيمَٰنِكُمْ إِن نَّعْفُ عَن طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنكُمْ نُعَذِّبْ طَآئِفَةًۢ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ مُجْرِمِينَ,"Do not present these false excuses, O hypocrites. You have exposed your disbelief, which was hidden, by making fun. If I were to pardon a group from among you, when they leave their hypocrisy and repent from it by sincerely repenting to Allah, I will punish another group from among you due to their remaining in hypocrisy and their failure to repent from it."
"The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other. They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God). Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them. The hypocrites are indeed transgressors.",66,9,ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقَٰتُ بَعْضُهُم مِّنۢ بَعْضٍ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَقْبِضُونَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ نَسُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ فَنَسِيَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"The hypocrites, men and women, are all the same with respect to their states of hypocrisy. They are not like the believers, because they call to evil and prohibit good. They are also miserly with their wealth and do not spend it in Allah’s path. They turned away from Allah and were unmindful of Him, and they only remember Allah a little. Allah therefore left them out of His mercy. The hypocrites are the ones who deviate from following Allah and the path of truth by going towards sin and the path of misguidance."
"God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is sufficient for them: They have God's condemnation and lasting torment,",67,9,وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقَٰتِ وَٱلْكُفَّارَ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا هِىَ حَسْبُهُمْ وَلَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,Allah has promised the hypocrites and the disbelievers who do not repent that He will make them enter the fire of Hell to live there eternally – it is a sufficient punishment for them. Allah has distanced them from His mercy and for them is an everlasting punishment.
"Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them. You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse. Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers.",68,9,كَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ كَانُوٓا۟ أَشَدَّ مِنكُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرَ أَمْوَٰلًا وَأَوْلَٰدًا فَٱسْتَمْتَعُوا۟ بِخَلَٰقِهِمْ فَٱسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِخَلَٰقِكُمْ كَمَا ٱسْتَمْتَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُم بِخَلَٰقِهِمْ وَخُضْتُمْ كَٱلَّذِى خَاضُوٓا۟ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"O hypocrites, in your disbelief and mockery you are like the communities of disbelievers before you. They were greater than you in strength, and had more wealth and children, and they enjoyed their allotted share of the luxuries and pleasures of this world. You, O hypocrites, also enjoyed your allotted share of the world, just as the communities of the past did. You indulged in denying the truth and insulting the messenger just as they did. Those who have these shameful qualities will have their actions reduced to nothing by Allah due to their disbelief. They are the losers, whose own souls have brought them to the point of destruction."
"Has not the account of those before them come to them, -- of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed? Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves.",69,9,أَلَمْ يَأْتِهِمْ نَبَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَقَوْمِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَأَصْحَٰبِ مَدْيَنَ وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَٰتِ أَتَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Have the hypocrites not heard of what previous disbelieving communities did and what their end was? The news of the people of Noah, Hūd, Ṣāliḥ, Abraham, the inhabitants of Madyan and the towns of the nation of Lot? Their messengers came to them with clear proof and evidence. Allah was not unjust in punishing them, as their messengers had warned them, but they were unjust to themselves because of their disbelief in Allah and rejection of His messengers."
"Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God will be merciful to them, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.",70,9,وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَيُطِيعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"The believers, men and women, are helpers to one another, because of the faith that unites them. They command good – which is everything loved by Allah, represented by the various forms of obedience, such as accepting His Oneness and the ritual prayer – and they prohibit evil – which is everything hated by Allah, and includes sins such as disbelief and dealing in usury in financial transactions. They perform the ritual prayer in a complete manner, and they obey Allah and His Messenger. People with these praiseworthy qualities will receive Allah’s mercy. Allah is Mighty and nothing can overcome Him. He is Wise in His creating, handling of matters and establishment of laws."
"God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all. That will be happiness supreme.",71,9,وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَمَسَٰكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِى جَنَّٰتِ عَدْنٍ وَرِضْوَٰنٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Allah has promised those men and women who have faith in Him that He will enter them, on the Day of Judgement, into gardens with rivers flowing beneath their palaces, where they will live eternally. In these gardens, they will not die and their delight will never end. Yet the pleasure that Allah will give to them will be greater than all of that. This reward is the great success which no other success can equal."
"Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly. Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!",72,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ جَٰهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O Messenger, strive against the disbelievers by fighting against them with the sword, and strive against the hypocrites with well-expressed arguments. Be hard with both groups because that is what they deserve. Their resting place on the Day of Judgement will be Hell. What an evil place they will end up in!"
"They swear by God: ""We never said this."" But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.",73,9,يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ مَا قَالُوا۟ وَلَقَدْ قَالُوا۟ كَلِمَةَ ٱلْكُفْرِ وَكَفَرُوا۟ بَعْدَ إِسْلَٰمِهِمْ وَهَمُّوا۟ بِمَا لَمْ يَنَالُوا۟ وَمَا نَقَمُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ أَنْ أَغْنَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ فَإِن يَتُوبُوا۟ يَكُ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَتَوَلَّوْا۟ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"The hypocrites swear a false oath by Allah that they did not say the words of insults about you and your religion that have reached you. But they did say those things which showed them to be disbelievers after they had announced that they have faith. They had intended to assassinate the Prophet (peace be upon him), but were unsuccessful. They only disliked something that should not have been disliked!: that Allah had graciously favoured the Prophet and the believers by blessing them with the gains of war. If they turn to Allah and repent from their hypocrisy, their repentance will be better for them than remaining in their hypocrisy. Yet if they do not repent to Allah, He will punish them with a painful punishment in this world, by having them killed or taken prisoner, and He will also punish them in the Afterlife in the fire of Hell, and they will not have anyone to save them from the punishment."
"Some of them made a covenant with God: ""If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright.""",74,9,وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ عَٰهَدَ ٱللَّهَ لَئِنْ ءَاتَىٰنَا مِن فَضْلِهِۦ لَنَصَّدَّقَنَّ وَلَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Some of the hypocrites have made a promise with Allah, saying: If Allah gives us from His bounty, we will certainly give charity to the poor and we will be of the righteous ones whose actions are good."
"But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away.",75,9,فَلَمَّآ ءَاتَىٰهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦ بَخِلُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَتَوَلَّوا۟ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"When Allah, may He be glorified, gave them from His bounty, they did not fulfil the promise they made with Him. Instead, they became miserly and did not give any charity, and they turned away from accepting the faith with hatred."
"As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him.",76,9,فَأَعْقَبَهُمْ نِفَاقًا فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يَلْقَوْنَهُۥ بِمَآ أَخْلَفُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا وَعَدُوهُ وَبِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْذِبُونَ,"Allah therefore firmly established hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day of Judgement, as a punishment for their breaking their promise with Allah and for their lying."
"Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?",77,9,أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَىٰهُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَّٰمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,"Do the hypocrites not know that Allah knows the plots they keep secret in their meetings and that Allah, may He be glorified, is the Knower of all Ghaib things? No action of theirs is hidden from Him and He will repay them for that."
"They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment.",78,9,ٱلَّذِينَ يَلْمِزُونَ ٱلْمُطَّوِّعِينَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِى ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ إِلَّا جُهْدَهُمْ فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ سَخِرَ ٱللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who find fault with the believers who voluntarily give a little charity, who only find a little that they are able to give, and they poke fun at them – saying: Of what use is their charity? – Allah mocks them in return for their mocking the believers; and they will receive a painful punishment."
"Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way.",79,9,ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ أَوْ لَا تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ إِن تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً فَلَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Allah will never forgive the hypocrites, even if the Messenger was to ask for their forgiveness, because they do not deserve to be forgiven, nno matter how much forgiveness is sought for them. They disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and they deliberately oppose Allah’s sacred law."
"Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God's Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: ""Do not go in this heat."" Tell them: ""The heat of Hell is far more intense."" If only they had cared to instruct themselves!",80,9,فَرِحَ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ بِمَقْعَدِهِمْ خِلَٰفَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَرِهُوٓا۟ أَن يُجَٰهِدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَالُوا۟ لَا تَنفِرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْحَرِّ قُلْ نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ أَشَدُّ حَرًّا لَّوْ كَانُوا۟ يَفْقَهُونَ,"Those hypocrites who failed to join the battle of Tabūk were happy not to strive in Allah’s path, in opposition to the Messenger of Allah. They were reluctant to strive with their wealth and live in Allah’s path as the believers did. They said to their fellow hypocrites, in order to keep them behind, ‘Do not march in the heat!’ The battle of Tabūk was during the hot season. Say to them, O Messenger: The fire of Hell that awaits the hypocrites is much hotter than this heat that they are running away from, if they only knew."
"So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done.",81,9,فَلْيَضْحَكُوا۟ قَلِيلًا وَلْيَبْكُوا۟ كَثِيرًا جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Let these hypocrites, who failed to strive in Allah’s path, laugh a little in their temporary life of the world and let them cry much in their everlasting life of the Afterlife in return for the disbelief and sins they committed in the world."
"If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: ""You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more. You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind.""",82,9,فَإِن رَّجَعَكَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَىٰ طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ فَٱسْتَـْٔذَنُوكَ لِلْخُرُوجِ فَقُل لَّن تَخْرُجُوا۟ مَعِىَ أَبَدًا وَلَن تُقَٰتِلُوا۟ مَعِىَ عَدُوًّا إِنَّكُمْ رَضِيتُم بِٱلْقُعُودِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَٱقْعُدُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلْخَٰلِفِينَ,"If Allah returns you, O Prophet, to a group of these hypocrites who are firm in their hypocrisy and they ask you for permission to go out with you in another battle, then say to them: You, hypocrites, will never go out with me in Allah’s path, as a punishment for you and a means of avoiding the harms that may arise due to your presence with me. You were quite pleased to remain behind in the battle of Tabūk, so stay with those sick persons, women and children who remain behind."
"Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die, nor stand to pray at their graves, for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet, and died transgressors.",83,9,وَلَا تُصَلِّ عَلَىٰٓ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُم مَّاتَ أَبَدًا وَلَا تَقُمْ عَلَىٰ قَبْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَمَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"Do not offer the prayer, O Messenger, over any one of the hypocrites who dies; and do not stand to pray for forgiveness at their gravesides. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and they died whilst they had left Allah’s obedience. No prayer should be offered for such a person."
"And let not their wealth and children astonish you. God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.",84,9,وَلَا تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَأَوْلَٰدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُعَذِّبَهُم بِهَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"Do not, O Messenger, let the wealth and children of these hypocrites impress you. Allah only intends to punish them with that in the life of the world, through the difficulties they face and the disasters they are afflicted with respect to them, and that their souls leave their bodies while they are in disbelief."
"Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): ""Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet,"" the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: ""Leave us with those who are left behind.""",85,9,وَإِذَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ أَنْ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَجَٰهِدُوا۟ مَعَ رَسُولِهِ ٱسْتَـْٔذَنَكَ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلطَّوْلِ مِنْهُمْ وَقَالُوا۟ ذَرْنَا نَكُن مَّعَ ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ,"When Allah reveals a sūrah to His Prophet (peace be upon him) that contains the instruction to have faith in Allah and to strive in His path, the rich people from among them ask you for permission to stay behind and they say: Let us stay behind with those who are excused, such as the weak and those who are chronically ill."
"They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand.",86,9,رَضُوا۟ بِأَن يَكُونُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلْخَوَالِفِ وَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ,"These hypocrites are pleased with disgrace and humiliation, since they are pleased to stay behind with those who are excused. Allah has sealed their hearts because of their disbelief and hypocrisy, so they do not know where their best interests are. They are therefore similar to animals."
"But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him, and have fought wealth and soul (in the way of God), are blessed and will be successful.",87,9,لَٰكِنِ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ جَٰهَدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتُ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"The Messenger and the believers with him did not remain behind from striving in Allah’s path, as these people did. Instead, they strived in Allah’s path with their wealth and their lives. Their reward from Allah is that they will receive worldly benefits, such as victory and gains of war, as well as benefits in the Afterlife, which includes entry into Paradise and successful attainment of their desires and salvation from what they fear."
"God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water, where they will abide for ever. This will be the supreme triumph.",88,9,أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Allah has prepared for these believers gardens with rivers flowing beneath their palaces, where they shall live eternally. That reward is the great success that cannot be equalled by any other."
"Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing. So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful.",89,9,وَجَآءَ ٱلْمُعَذِّرُونَ مِنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ لِيُؤْذَنَ لَهُمْ وَقَعَدَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"A group of people from the desert Arabs of Medina and the surrounding areas came with excuses to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him), so that he would give them permission to remain behind from going out and striving in Allah’s path. Another group of people who did not even make any excuse also stayed behind from going out because they did not accept the Prophet and they did not have faith in Allah’s promise. A painful punishment will afflict these people because of their disbelief."
"No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind.",90,9,لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلضُّعَفَآءِ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلْمَرْضَىٰ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ مَا يُنفِقُونَ حَرَجٌ إِذَا نَصَحُوا۟ لِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ مَا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"There is no sin on women, children, the sick, the disabled who are chronically ill or blind, and the poor who do have any wealth to spend in order to equip themselves for remaining behind from going out, since they have valid excuses, as long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger and they practise His sacred law. Punishment will not fall on those who do good from among these people who are excused. Allah forgives the sins of those who do good and shows them mercy."
"Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: ""I cannot find any means of conveyance for you,"" and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage).",91,9,وَلَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا مَآ أَتَوْكَ لِتَحْمِلَهُمْ قُلْتَ لَآ أَجِدُ مَآ أَحْمِلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ تَوَلَّوا۟ وَّأَعْيُنُهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ ٱلدَّمْعِ حَزَنًا أَلَّا يَجِدُوا۟ مَا يُنفِقُونَ,"There is likewise no sin on those who stay behind from you after coming to you, O Messenger, asking you to give them an animal to ride and you said to them, ‘I do not have any animal to give you to ride’. They then turned away from you with their tears flowing out of sorrow that they could not find anything to spend of their own or from your side."
"Blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind. They prefer to stay with women who stay at home, and God seals their hearts; so they do not understand.",92,9,إِنَّمَا ٱلسَّبِيلُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَـْٔذِنُونَكَ وَهُمْ أَغْنِيَآءُ رَضُوا۟ بِأَن يَكُونُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلْخَوَالِفِ وَطَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"There will only be punishment and blame on those who ask you, O Messenger, for permission to remain behind from striving while they are able to do so, due to their having the means to equip themselves. They are pleased with disgrace and humiliation for themselves by staying behind with those who remain behind at home. Allah has sealed their hearts so they are not affected by any warning. Because of this, they do not know where their best interests lie, so they can choose that; or where there is harm, so they can avoid it."
"When you come back they will offer excuses to you. Tell them: ""Make no excuses; we do not believe you. God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct. Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did.""",93,9,يَعْتَذِرُونَ إِلَيْكُمْ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ قُل لَّا تَعْتَذِرُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكُمْ قَدْ نَبَّأَنَا ٱللَّهُ مِنْ أَخْبَارِكُمْ وَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُۥ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"The hypocrites who stayed behind from striving in Allah’s path will present weak excuses to the Muslims when they return from their battle. Allah directs His Prophet and the believers to respond to them by saying: Do not make false excuses. We will never accept what you tell us because Allah has informed us about the excuses you make up. Allah and His Messenger will soon see whether you repent, in which case Allah will accept your repentance, or if you will persist in your hypocrisy. Then you will be returned to Allah, the One Who knows everything, and He will inform you about what you used to do and repay you for that. So rush towards repentance and good actions."
"They will beg you in the name of God, on your return, to forgive them; but you keep away from them: They are scum; their abode is Hell: Requital for what they had done.",94,9,سَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ إِذَا ٱنقَلَبْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ لِتُعْرِضُوا۟ عَنْهُمْ فَأَعْرِضُوا۟ عَنْهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ رِجْسٌ وَمَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Those who stay behind will swear by Allah when you, O believers, return to them, in order to strengthen their false oaths, so that you do not blame them. Therefore leave them alone and ignore them. They are filthy and impure from the inside. They will end up in Hell, as a repayment to them for their hypocrisy and the sins they committed."
"They will plead on oath that you accept them. Even if you accept them, remember God does not accept people who are disobedient.",95,9,يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ لِتَرْضَوْا۟ عَنْهُمْ فَإِن تَرْضَوْا۟ عَنْهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَرْضَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Those who stay behind will swear to you, O believers, so that you become pleased with them and accept their excuses. Do not become pleased with them. If you become pleased with them you would go against your Lord, because He will not be pleased with people who have left His obedience by disbelief and hypocrisy. So be careful, O Muslims, of becoming pleased with those whom Allah is not pleased with."
"The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy, and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God; yet God is aware of everything and is wise.",96,9,ٱلْأَعْرَابُ أَشَدُّ كُفْرًا وَنِفَاقًا وَأَجْدَرُ أَلَّا يَعْلَمُوا۟ حُدُودَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"If the people of the desert are of those who adopt disbelief or hypocrisy, then their disbelief and hypocrisy is stronger than that of others who live in city areas. They are also more likely to be ignorant of religion and the obligatory and recommended acts of the sacred law that Allah has revealed to His Messenger. This is because of their lack of culture, their harshness, and their lack of interacting with others. Allah knows about their condition. Nothing is hidden from Him. He is Wise is in His handling of matters and establishment of laws."
"Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune. For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything.",97,9,وَمِنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مَا يُنفِقُ مَغْرَمًا وَيَتَرَبَّصُ بِكُمُ ٱلدَّوَآئِرَ عَلَيْهِمْ دَآئِرَةُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Some of the desert hypocrites consider whatever wealth they spend in Allah’s path to be a loss and a punishment, because they think that there will be no reward for spending and that Allah will not punish them if they do not spend. Despite this, they sometimes spend to show off and to hide their real beliefs. They wait for evil to come to you, O believers, so that they can be rid of you. Instead, But Allah has made the evil and the turn of fortune that they wished to afflict the believers to occur on them instead. Allah hears what they say and knows what they keep hidden in their hearts."
"Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet. This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind.",98,9,وَمِنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَيَتَّخِذُ مَا يُنفِقُ قُرُبَٰتٍ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَصَلَوَٰتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ أَلَآ إِنَّهَا قُرْبَةٌ لَّهُمْ سَيُدْخِلُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Yet some of those who live in the desert have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgement and they consider any wealth they spend in Allah’s path as a means of gaining closeness to Allah, and of receiving the prayer of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and his asking forgiveness for them. Without doubt, their spending in Allah’s path and the prayer of the Messenger are means of gaining closeness to Allah; and they will find their reward with Allah when He enters them into His mercy, with His forgiveness and His Paradise. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate towards those of His servants who repent to Him."
"Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way. For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme.",99,9,وَٱلسَّٰبِقُونَ ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ وَٱلْأَنصَارِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَٰنٍ رَّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى تَحْتَهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"The leaders in faith – in terms of having good belief, words and actions – from among the Emigrants who left their homes migrating to Allah, and from among the Helpers who assisted His Messenger (peace be upon him), and those who followed the Emigrants and Helpers, Allah is pleased with them and He has accepted their actions. They are also pleased with Him because of the great reward that He is to give them: He has prepared for them gardens with rivers flowing beneath their palaces, where they shall live eternally. That reward is the great success."
"Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites, and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy. You are not aware of them; We know them, and will punish them twice, and they will be sent to a harrowing doom.",100,9,وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ مُنَٰفِقُونَ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ مَرَدُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلنِّفَاقِ لَا تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ سَنُعَذِّبُهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَذَابٍ عَظِيمٍ,"Some of those who live in the desert surrounding Medina are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina. They are firm and staunch in their hypocrisy. You, O Messenger, do not know them, but it is Allah Who knows them. Allah will punish them twice: once in this world by exposing their hypocrisy and by their being killed and taken captive, and again in the Afterlife when they will be punished in the grave. Then they will receive, on the Day of Judgement, a great punishment in the lowest level of the fire of Hell."
"But there are others who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil. It may be that God will accept their repentance, for God is forgiving and kind.",101,9,وَءَاخَرُونَ ٱعْتَرَفُوا۟ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ خَلَطُوا۟ عَمَلًا صَٰلِحًا وَءَاخَرَ سَيِّئًا عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"There are others from among the people of Medina who stayed behind from the battle without any valid excuse. They then confessed that they had no excuse and they did not present false excuses. They have mixed their prior good actions of following Allah, obeying His sacred laws and striving in His path with an evil action; yet they hope that Allah will accept their repentance and pardon them. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate towards those of His servants who repent to Him."
"Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress, and invoke blessings upon them. Your blessings will surely bring them peace, for God hears all and knows everything.",102,9,خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِم بِهَا وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ صَلَوٰتَكَ سَكَنٌ لَّهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Take, O Messenger, zakat from their wealth, so that you can purify them from the uncleanliness of sins and evil actions, and by which you can increase their good actions. Pray for them after taking it from them, because your prayer is a means of comfort and mercy for them. Allah hears your prayer and knows about their actions and intentions."
"Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His creatures and receives what they offer in charity, and that He is forgiving and kind?",103,9,أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ ٱلتَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَأْخُذُ ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Those who had stayed behind from striving in Allah’s path and who have repented to Allah should know that Allah accepts the repentance of His servants; and that He accepts charity, even though He is in no need of it, and rewards those who give charity. They should know that Allah, may He be glorified, is the One Who accepts repentance and is Compassionate towards those servants of His who repent to Him."
"Say to them: ""Act. God will see your conduct, and so will His Apostle and the faithful; for you will in the end go back to Him, who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you of what you were doing.""",104,9,وَقُلِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ فَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to those who had stayed behind from striving in Allah’s path and who have repented from their sin: : Make up for the harm caused by what you missed and be sincere in your actions to Allah. Do what pleases Him, because Allah, His Messenger and the believers will soon see your actions. Then you will be returned, on the Day of Judgement, to your Lord, the One Who knows everything. He knows what you hide and what you make public and He will inform you about what you used to do in the world and repay you for that."
"There are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of God. He may punish or pardon them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",105,9,وَءَاخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لِأَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِمَّا يُعَذِّبُهُمْ وَإِمَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"There are others from among those who stayed behind from the battle of Tabūk who did not have any valid excuse. The matter of these people has been deferred to Allah’s decree and His decision in their regard. Allah will decide about them as He wishes: He will either punish them if they do not repent to Him, or He will accept their repentance if they do. Allah knows who is deserving of His punishment and who deserves His pardon. Allah is Wise in His establishment of laws and handling of affairs. These people were Murārah ibn Al-Rabī‘, Ka‘b ibn Mālik and Hilāl ibn Umayyah."
"There are those who built a mosque on opposition and disbelief, and to cause rifts among the faithful, and to serve as an outpost for those who have warred against God and His Apostle before this. Yet they will surely swear: ""We had only meant well."" But God is witness that they are liars.",106,9,وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مَسْجِدًا ضِرَارًا وَكُفْرًا وَتَفْرِيقًۢا بَيْنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَإِرْصَادًا لِّمَنْ حَارَبَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَيَحْلِفُنَّ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلَّا ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"There were also some hypocrites who built a mosque, not for Allah’s obedience, but to harm the Muslims, to support disbelief by strengthening the people of hypocrisy, to cause disunity amongst the believers and in preparation and anticipation for those who had waged war against Allah and His Messenger prior to the construction of the mosque. These hypocrites swear to you that they only wanted goodness for the Muslims. Allah is witness that they are lying in this claim of theirs."
Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it. There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure.,107,9,لَا تَقُمْ فِيهِ أَبَدًا لَّمَسْجِدٌ أُسِّسَ عَلَى ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ مِنْ أَوَّلِ يَوْمٍ أَحَقُّ أَن تَقُومَ فِيهِ فِيهِ رِجَالٌ يُحِبُّونَ أَن يَتَطَهَّرُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُطَّهِّرِينَ,"Do not accept, O Prophet, the invitation of the hypocrites to you to pray in this mosque which was built for immoral purposes. Rather, the Qubā’ mosque which was founded from its beginning on Mindfulness is more worthy of your praying in it than this mosque that was founded on disbelief. In the Qubā’ mosque, there are men who love to purify themselves from ritual and physical impurities with water, as well as from sins with repentance and seeking forgiveness. Allah loves those who purify themselves from ritual and physical impurities and from sins."
"Is the man who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to God and the wish to seek His favour, better, or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water, which will collapse with him into the fire of Hell? But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust.",108,9,أَفَمَنْ أَسَّسَ بُنْيَٰنَهُۥ عَلَىٰ تَقْوَىٰ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَٰنٍ خَيْرٌ أَم مَّنْ أَسَّسَ بُنْيَٰنَهُۥ عَلَىٰ شَفَا جُرُفٍ هَارٍ فَٱنْهَارَ بِهِۦ فِى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Can those who founded their building on recognition of Allah (by following His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions) and Allah’s pleasure (by doing all forms of good) be equal to those who built a mosque to cause harm to the Muslims, to strengthen disbelief and to cause disunity amongst the believers? They can never be equal! The first have a strong structure with good foundation so it will not collapse; yet the second group are similar to a person who built a structure on the edge of a pit that is about to collapse and which collapses with him into the depths of Hell. Allah does not guide those who do wrong by committing disbelief, hypocrisy and other wrongs."
"The edifice they have built will always fill their minds with perturbation (which will not cease) till their hearts are rent to pieces, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",109,9,لَا يَزَالُ بُنْيَٰنُهُمُ ٱلَّذِى بَنَوْا۟ رِيبَةً فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ إِلَّآ أَن تَقَطَّعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,The mosque that they built in order to cause harm will continue to be a source of doubt and hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces by their death or by their being killed by the sword. Allah knows the actions of His servants and He is Wise in the decision He passes with respect to repaying them for their good or evil.
"God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme.",110,9,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱشْتَرَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَٰلَهُم بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةَ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِى ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَٱلْإِنجِيلِ وَٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِۦ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فَٱسْتَبْشِرُوا۟ بِبَيْعِكُمُ ٱلَّذِى بَايَعْتُم بِهِۦ وَذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Allah, may He be glorified, has purchased from the believers their lives – despite them belonging to Him – out of His grace for a high price: Paradise. They will fight the disbelievers so that Allah’s Word is highest and they will kill the disbelievers or be killed by them. Allah has made this true promise in the Torah (the scripture of Moses), the Gospel (the scripture of Jesus), and the Qur’ān (the scripture of Muhammad (peace be upon him)). There is no one who is more faithful to his promise than Allah. so rejoice O believers, with the trade that you made with Allah, because of your gaining such a huge profit in it. That deal is the great success."
"To those who repent and pay homage, give praise and are devout, who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication, who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad, and keep to the limits set by God, announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful.",111,9,ٱلتَّٰٓئِبُونَ ٱلْعَٰبِدُونَ ٱلْحَٰمِدُونَ ٱلسَّٰٓئِحُونَ ٱلرَّٰكِعُونَ ٱلسَّٰجِدُونَ ٱلْءَامِرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱلنَّاهُونَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَٱلْحَٰفِظُونَ لِحُدُودِ ٱللَّهِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The people who will receive this great reward are those who turn to Allah in repentance from idolatry, hypocrisy and sins; are sincere in their worship of Allah; praise their Lord in every condition; go out and strive in Allah’s path; fast; pray; instruct that which Allah and His Messenger have instructed and prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited; and guard Allah’s instructions by following them and His prohibitions by avoiding them. O Messenger, tell the believers who have these qualities the good news of what will make them happy in this world and the Afterlife."
"It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters, even though they may be their relatives, after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell.",112,9,مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِىِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُوٓا۟ أُو۟لِى قُرْبَىٰ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"It is not right for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness from Allah for the idolaters, even if they are their relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are the people of the fire of Hell – because they died as idolaters."
"As for Abraham's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind.",113,9,وَمَا كَانَ ٱسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُۥٓ أَنَّهُۥ عَدُوٌّ لِّلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ إِنَّ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ لَأَوَّٰهٌ حَلِيمٌ,"Abraham’s seeking forgiveness for his polytheist father was only because of a promise he had made to him to do so, in the hope that he would submit. When it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of Allah, due to the advice not being of benefit to him or due to his coming to know through revelation that he will die as a disbeliever, he renounced him. He had asked forgiveness for him on the basis of his own reasoning and not in contradiction of any law that Allah had revealed to him. Abraham (peace be with him) used to frequently turn to Allah in humility and he used to overlook and pardon his people who were wrongdoers."
"God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything.",114,9,وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًۢا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَىٰهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا يَتَّقُونَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah would never pass the judgement of misguidance against a people, after He had given them guidance, until He makes clear to them those forbidden things that they must avoid. If they do that which Allah had forbidden after it has been declared forbidden and made clear to them, then He will judge them as misguided. Allah knows everything. Nothing is hidden from Him. He has taught you what you did not know."
Verily God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He alone is the giver of life and death; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper.,115,9,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"The control of the heavens and the control of the earth belongs to Allah. He has no partner in this, and nothing in them is hidden from Him. He gives life to whomever He wills and causes whomever He wills to die. You, O people, do not have, besides Allah, any friend to take care of your affairs nor any protector to guard you against evil and assist you against your enemy."
"God was kind to the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress. When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy, for He is compassionate and kind.",116,9,لَّقَد تَّابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ وَٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ وَٱلْأَنصَارِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ فِى سَاعَةِ ٱلْعُسْرَةِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا كَادَ يَزِيغُ قُلُوبُ فَرِيقٍ مِّنْهُمْ ثُمَّ تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّهُۥ بِهِمْ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah has forgiven the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) since he gave permission to the hypocrites to stay behind from the battle of Tabūk. He has also forgiven the Emigrants and the Helpers who did not stay behind, but followed him in the battle of Tabūk despite the intense heat, the lack of means and the powerful strength of the enemy. This was after a group of them who intended to abandon the expedition, almost deviated from the truth and the path of correct guidance, because of the great difficulty they faced. Then Allah enabled them to be patient and to go out for that battle. He forgave them, for He, may He be glorified, is Kind and Merciful towards them. It was because of His mercy that He enabled them to repent to Him and that He accepted their repentance."
"He has relented towards the three also (who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch) whose case was left undecided, and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them, and their lives were confined, and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God. So He softened towards them that they may repent; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful.",117,9,وَعَلَى ٱلثَّلَٰثَةِ ٱلَّذِينَ خُلِّفُوا۟ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَن لَّا مَلْجَأَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَّآ إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ لِيَتُوبُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Allah turned in forgiveness to the three – Murārah ibn Al-Rabī‘, Ka‘b ibn Mālik and Hilāl ibn Umayyah – who stayed behind from going with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)to Tabūk. The Prophet (peace be upon him)instructed people to stay away from them, which made them feel sadness and grief. The earth seemed narrow to them despite its vastness, and their hearts felt constricted because of their loneliness, and they were certain there was no place of refuge or help they could go to except to Allah alone. Allah was Merciful to them, enabling them to turn to Him, asking for forgiveness, and accepting their repentance. Allah is the One who accepts the repentance from His slaves, and is full of mercy and compassion to them."
"O believers, do not stray from the path of God, and be with those who are truthful.",118,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَكُونُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"O you who believe and follow the Messenger, act according to His sacred law, and be mindful of Him, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited; and be with those who are true in their faith and in what they say and do, as there is no salvation except in truth."
"It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour. Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste.",119,9,مَا كَانَ لِأَهْلِ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ أَن يَتَخَلَّفُوا۟ عَن رَّسُولِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا يَرْغَبُوا۟ بِأَنفُسِهِمْ عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ لَا يُصِيبُهُمْ ظَمَأٌ وَلَا نَصَبٌ وَلَا مَخْمَصَةٌ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا يَطَـُٔونَ مَوْطِئًا يَغِيظُ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَلَا يَنَالُونَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلًا إِلَّا كُتِبَ لَهُم بِهِۦ عَمَلٌ صَٰلِحٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"It is not for the people of Medina, or those around them of the people who live in the desert, to stay behind the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)if he himself goes out to fight, or to be stingy with themselves and give preference to their own safety over the safety of the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). Rather, they should sacrifice themselves for him. This is because they suffer no thirst, tiredness or hunger for the sake of Allah, and do not step anywhere in the land of those who deny the truth with their own feet or the hooves of their horses or camels, angering thereby those who oppose the truth, and do not make a gain over their enemy, killing or capturing them, making war gains or defeating them, except that Allah records for them the reward of a good action for them, which He accepts from them. Allah does not allow the reward of those who do good to be lost. Rather, He gives it to them in full, and increases the reward for them."
"There is not a sum, large or small, that they spend, not a piece of land that they traverse (in the service of God) which is not put down in their favour, so that God could reward them for what they had done.",120,9,وَلَا يُنفِقُونَ نَفَقَةً صَغِيرَةً وَلَا كَبِيرَةً وَلَا يَقْطَعُونَ وَادِيًا إِلَّا كُتِبَ لَهُمْ لِيَجْزِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"These successful ones do not sacrifice any wealth, whether it is small or great, and do not cross any valley except that their sacrifice or journey is recorded so that Allah may repay them, giving them in the Afterlife the reward for the best of what they used to do."
"It is not possible for all believers to go out (to fight). So a part of each section (of the population) should go (to fight) in order that the others may acquire understanding of law and divinity, and warn their companions on return so that they may take heed for themselves.",121,9,وَمَا كَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ لِيَنفِرُوا۟ كَآفَّةً فَلَوْلَا نَفَرَ مِن كُلِّ فِرْقَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ طَآئِفَةٌ لِّيَتَفَقَّهُوا۟ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُوا۟ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ,"The believers should not go out all together to fight, so that they are not wiped out if their enemy overcomes them, and they should not all stay behind. A group should go out to strive for Allah’s sake, and a group should remain behind to accompany the messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and to gain understanding of the religion through the Qur’ān and sacred laws they hear from him, peace and blessings be upon him, to advise their people when they return to them of what they have learned, so that they are aware of Allah’s punishment and His consequences and they follow what He instructs and stay away from what He has not allowed. This was concerning the companies that the messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, would send to different areas, choosing a group from among his companions."
"O believers, fight the unbelievers around you, and let them realise that you are firm: Remember, God is with those who are pious and obedient to Him.",122,9,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْكُفَّارِ وَلْيَجِدُوا۟ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"O you who believe, fight against those who oppose the truth who are near to you, because of the danger they pose to you because of their proximity; and show strength in order to inspire fear in them and drive away their evil. Allah is with the Allah-conscious believers with His help and support."
"When a Surah is revealed some of them remark: ""Whose faith among you has it increased?"" It does increase the faith of those who believe, and they rejoice.",123,9,وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَٰذِهِۦٓ إِيمَٰنًا فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَٰنًا وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,"When Allah revealed a sūrah to the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), some of the hypocrites would ask by way of mocking and ridicule; 'Which one of you believers has had his faith increase?' As for those who had faith in Allah, and followed His Messenger, the revelation of the sūrah had indeed increased them in faith, and they were happy because of the benefit it contained for them in this world and for the Afterlife."
"But it adds disbelief to disbelief for those whose hearts are filled with doubt, and they die disbelieving.",124,9,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ وَمَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"As for the hypocrites, the revelation of the Qur’ān with its laws and stories increases them in sickness and wickedness because of their rejection of what is revealed, so that these deplorable characteristics become fixed in them; and the disease of their hearts increase with the revelation of the Qur’ān, because whenever something is revealed they are sceptical about it."
Do they not know that they are tried every year once or twice? Even then they do not repent and take heed.,125,9,أَوَلَا يَرَوْنَ أَنَّهُمْ يُفْتَنُونَ فِى كُلِّ عَامٍ مَّرَّةً أَوْ مَرَّتَيْنِ ثُمَّ لَا يَتُوبُونَ وَلَا هُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"Are the hypocrites not taught a lesson by being tried by Allah, when He exposes their hypocrisy, once or twice a year? Then, despite knowing that Allah did this to them, they do not turn to Him from their disbelief, asking for forgiveness, and do not root out their hypocrisy, or think about what happens to them and that it is from Allah."
"Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other (so as to ask): ""Is anyone looking at Us?"" and then turn away. Indeed God has turned their hearts away (from the truth), for they cannot discern the law of heaven.",126,9,وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ نَّظَرَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ هَلْ يَرَىٰكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ ثُمَّ ٱنصَرَفُوا۟ صَرَفَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ,"Whenever Allah reveals a sūrah to the Messenger (peace be upon him), mentioning the states of the hypocrites, the hypocrites would look at one another, saying ‘Does anyone see you?’ If no one is looking at them, they leave the gathering. Allah turned their hearts away from guidance and goodness, and leaves them, because they are a people who do not understand."
"To you has come an Apostle from among you. Any sorrow that befalls you weighs upon him; He is eager for your happiness, full of concern for the faithful, compassionate and kind.",127,9,لَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"There has come to you O Arabs, a messenger from among your own selves and from your lineage, who is an Arab like you. What is difficult for you is difficult for him. He is concerned about you, calling you to have faith in your Lord, and he is kind and compassionate with the believers."
"So, if they turn away, say to them: ""God is sufficient for me. There is no God but He; I depend on Him alone, the Lord of the glorious Throne.""",128,9,فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَقُلْ حَسْبِىَ ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَهُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"If they reject you O Messenger, not believing in what you come with, then say: 'Allah is sufficient for me, there is nothing worthy of worship except Him. I rely on Him alone, and He, Glory be to Him, is the Lord of the Great Throne.'"
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the authoritative Book.,0,10,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓر تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,Alif Lām Rā’ – the placement of such letters has been discussed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"Are the people astonished that a man who is one of them was commanded by Us to warn them and to bring glad tidings to those who believe that they have a true precedence with their Lord? (Yet) the unbelievers say: ""He is a clear sorcerer.""",1,10,أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ ٱلنَّاسَ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ قَالَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسَٰحِرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Are the people amazed that Allah has sent revelation to a man like themselves, instructing him to warn them about the punishment of Allah, and telling those who have faith in Allah the good news that they will have a high rank with their Lord, glory be to Him, as a reward for the good actions they did? The disbelievers said that this man who came with these verses was clearly a magician."
"Your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans, then assumed His power, dispensing all affairs. None can intercede with Him except by His leave. He is God, your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not be warned?",2,10,إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يُدَبِّرُ ٱلْأَمْرَ مَا مِن شَفِيعٍ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِۦ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Truly, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens in their greatness and the earth in its vastness in six days, and then established Himself on the Throne. Why do they wonder that a man from amongst them should be sent to them? Allah alone determines whatever He wills and no one can plead with Him on behalf of anyone unless Allah gives permission and is pleased with the one who pleads. That is Allah, your Lord, so devote your worship to Him alone being sincere to Him. Will you not then consider all of these proofs evidences that there is no god but He. Whoever heeds this reminder will know it to be true, and believe in Him."
"To Him will you all return: God's promise is true. It is He who originates creation, then will revert it, so that He may reward those who believe and do good things in all justice. But those who deny the truth will receive boiling water to drink and grievous punishment, for they disbelieved.",3,10,إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقًّا إِنَّهُۥ يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ لِيَجْزِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْفُرُونَ,"You will return to Him alone on the Day of Judgement, when He will repay you for what you have done. Allah’s promise to humankind about this is a true. He is well capable of that. He made people from clay without precedent. He will bring them back again after their death to reward with justice those who had faith in Allah and did good actions, neither subtracting from their good actions nor increasing their bad actions. As for those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, they will have a drink of boiling water which will affect their insides and for them is a painful punishment because of their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger."
"It is He who gave the sun its radiance, the moon its lustre, and appointed its stations so that you may compute years and numbers. God did not create them but with deliberation. He distinctly explains His signs for those who can understand.",4,10,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ ٱلشَّمْسَ ضِيَآءً وَٱلْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُۥ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا۟ عَدَدَ ٱلسِّنِينَ وَٱلْحِسَابَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ذَٰلِكَ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ يُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"It is He Who made the sun radiate light and made the moon a light illuminated by it, determining its progression through twenty-eight phases – a phase being the change it goes through every twenty-four hours – so that people would know the number of days by the sun and the number of months and years by the moon. Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is in them except with the truth, revealing His power and might to people. Allah makes clear these obvious signs and evidence that there is no god but Him for a people who know how to draw conclusions from such facts."
"In the alternation of night and day, and all that He has created in the heavens and the earth, are certainly signs for people who fear God.",5,10,إِنَّ فِى ٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ,"In the succession of the night and day, and the darkness and light that accompany this, and the shortness of one and length of the other, and in the created things in the heavens and the earth, are signs showing the power of Allah for a people who are Mindful, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited."
"As for those who do not hope to meet Us (after death), and are content with the life of this world, who are oblivious of Our signs,",6,10,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا وَرَضُوا۟ بِٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱطْمَأَنُّوا۟ بِهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِنَا غَٰفِلُونَ,"The disbelievers who do not prepare themselves for their meeting with Allah, not fearing it or desiring it, who are satisfied with the life of the world, which is passing, instead of the eternal life of the Afterlife, feeling themselves at home in this world and content with it, and who do not consider Allah’s signs –"
Will have Hell as their abode for what they have earned.,7,10,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَأْوَىٰهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Their dwelling place on the Day of Judgement will be the fire of Hell, because of what they earned through their disbelief and rejection."
But those who believe and act for a beneficial end will be guided by their Lord for their good faith. At their feet shall flow streams of running water in gardens of delight.,8,10,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُم بِإِيمَٰنِهِمْ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ فِى جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Those who have faith in Allah and do good actions, Allah will guide them because of their faith to doing more good actions that lead to His Pleasure. Then on the Day of Judgement, Allah will enter them into gardens of eternal bliss with rivers flowing beneath them."
"Their invocation will be: ""All glory to you, O God,"" and ""Peace"" will be their salutation, and the end of their prayer (will be): ""All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.""",9,10,دَعْوَىٰهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَٰنَكَ ٱللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَٰمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَىٰهُمْ أَنِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Their prayer in Paradise will be the glorifying of Allah; and the greeting of Allah to them and the angels and their greeting to each other will be ‘Peace’ and the end of their prayer will be praising Allah, the Lord of all creation."
"If God were to hasten the evil, as men try to hasten the good, their term would come to end. So We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander perplexed in transgression.",10,10,وَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ ٱلشَّرَّ ٱسْتِعْجَالَهُم بِٱلْخَيْرِ لَقُضِىَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَجَلُهُمْ فَنَذَرُ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا فِى طُغْيَٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"If Allah responded quickly to people who pray for evil upon themselves, their children, or their wealth when they are angry, in the way He responds to them when they pray for good, they would have been destroyed. But Allah gives them time. He abandons those who do not expect to meet Him, because they do not fear the consequences of their actions, or hope for a reward, leaving them wavering and uncertain, sceptical about the Day of Judgement."
"When man is afflicted with adversity he calls to Us, whether lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We take away his troubles, he moves away, as though he had never called to Us in affliction. In the same way, attractive have been made their deeds to the prodigals.",11,10,وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ ٱلضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنۢبِهِۦٓ أَوْ قَاعِدًا أَوْ قَآئِمًا فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُۥ مَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَىٰ ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"When those who transgress suffer from an illness or misfortune, they call on Allah, humbling themselves and invoking Him, lying on their sides, or sitting or standing, wanting Him to remove the misfortune from them; but when Allah answers their prayers, removing their suffering, they continue doing what they had been doing before, as if they had never called on Allah to remove their misfortune. Just as continuing in their error is made to look attractive to them, the disbelief and disobedience of the person who oversteps the limits is made to look attractive to them, so they do not give it up."
"How many generations did We lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust. Their apostles had brought clear proofs to them, yet they never believed. So We punished the sinful people.",12,10,وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْقُرُونَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُوا۟ وَجَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ لِيُؤْمِنُوا۟ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"And indeed I destroyed communities before you, because they rejected the messengers of Allah and fell to sin. Though their messengers came to them with clear proofs showing the truth of what they brought from their Lord, they were not keen to believe and so Allah abandoned them. Just as Allah repaid those previous, disobedient communities, He repays those who are like them in every time and place."
Then We appointed you leaders in the land after them to see how you behaved.,13,10,ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَٰكُمْ خَلَٰٓئِفَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ لِنَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Then He made you successors to these communities who rejected the truth and who were destroyed, to see what you would do, and whether you would do good, for which you would be rewarded; or do evil, which you would have to face the consequences of."
"When Our clear messages are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us, say: ""Bring a different Qur'an, or make amendments to this one."" Say: ""It is not for me to change it of my will. I follow (only) what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an awful Day.""",14,10,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَاتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا ٱئْتِ بِقُرْءَانٍ غَيْرِ هَٰذَآ أَوْ بَدِّلْهُ قُلْ مَا يَكُونُ لِىٓ أَنْ أُبَدِّلَهُۥ مِن تِلْقَآئِ نَفْسِىٓ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّى عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"If the clear ayahs of the Qur’ān are recited to them proving the Oneness of Allah, those who deny the resurrection and who do not expect a reward or fear any consequences tell Muhammad to bring a different Qur’ān other than this Qur’ān which attacks the worship of idols, or to change it, substituting some or all of it for what agrees with their desires. Allah told Muhammad to say to them that it is not up to him to change anything himself, and what is more, he would not be able to come with something else. Rather, it is Allah alone Who changes what He wills of it, and the Messenger only follows what Allah reveals to him, fearing that if he went against Allah, by doing as they asked him to, he would be punished for it on a mighty day, the Day of Judgement."
"Say: ""Had God pleased I would never have recited it to you, nor would He have given you comprehension of it. (Remember that I am one of you) and have lived a whole life with you before (its revelation). Even then you do not understand.""",15,10,قُل لَّوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا تَلَوْتُهُۥ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَآ أَدْرَىٰكُم بِهِۦ فَقَدْ لَبِثْتُ فِيكُمْ عُمُرًا مِّن قَبْلِهِۦٓ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Say to them O Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him): If Allah had willed I would not have recited the Qur’ān to you, and it would not have been conveyed to you. And if Allah had willed, you would not have come to know this Qur’ān from my mouth. For I have lived among you for a long time- for forty years, not reading or writing, nor did I seek this type of knowledge or search for it. Can you not reason and realise that what I have brought you is from Allah, and not invented by myself?"
Who is more unjust than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations? The sinners will surely not be reprieved.,16,10,فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَٔايَٰتِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"There is no greater wrongdoer then he who makes up a lie about Allah, so how could I make a change in this Qur’ān, inventing a lie about it as you want me to? Those who overstep the limits of Allah by inventing lies about Him will not succeed."
"They worship those besides God who cannot do them harm or bring them gain, and say: ""These are our intercessors with God."" Say: ""Do you want to inform God of things in the heavens and the earth He does not know?"" Glorious is He, and too exalted for what they associate with Him!",17,10,وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ شُفَعَٰٓؤُنَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ أَتُنَبِّـُٔونَ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"The idolaters worship what they claim to be gods beside Allah, which cannot benefit or harm them, while Allah can benefit and harm as He wills; and they say that the things they worship will plead with Allah on their behalf, so that they will not be punished for their sins. Ask them O Messenger, 'Would you inform Allah, the Knowing, that He has a partner, when He does not know of a partner for Himself in the heavens or the earth?!' Allah is divine and far above the falsehood and lies of the idolaters."
"Men were once a community of one faith; but they differed (and followed different ways). Had it not been for the word proclaimed by your Lord before, their differences would have been resolved.",18,10,وَمَا كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ إِلَّآ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً فَٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ فِيمَا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"People were just one believing, unified nation, then they differed: some of them still had faith, while others disbelieved. If it had not been for the decree of Allah that He would not judge between them in what they differed about, then it would have been made clear which of them were guided and which of them were astray."
"They say: ""How is it that no sign was sent by his Lord (to His Prophet)?"" Tell them: ""Unknown things are only known to God. So watch and wait (for the sign); I am waiting and expecting with you.""",19,10,وَيَقُولُونَ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْغَيْبُ لِلَّهِ فَٱنتَظِرُوٓا۟ إِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُنتَظِرِينَ,"The idolaters ask why a sign is not sent to Muhammad from his Lord to prove the truth of what he says. Say to them O Messenger, 'The sending down of signs is Allah’s knowledge alone, so wait for the sign you ask for, as I am also waiting along with you for it.'"
"When We let them taste Our mercy after affliction, they contrive against Our signs. Say: ""God is swifter at contriving,"" for Our angels record everything you plan.",20,10,وَإِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلنَّاسَ رَحْمَةً مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُمْ إِذَا لَهُم مَّكْرٌ فِىٓ ءَايَاتِنَا قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَسْرَعُ مَكْرًا إِنَّ رُسُلَنَا يَكْتُبُونَ مَا تَمْكُرُونَ,"If Allah makes the idolaters experience some mercy, such as rain and abundance after drought and suffering, they start to plot and scheme in rejection of Allah’s signs. Say O Messenger to these idolaters, that Allah is quicker at plotting and in enticing and luring them, and quicker in dealing His Punishment. The angels record what they plan in the way of scheming, and nothing escapes them, so how could it escape their Creator? Allah will repay them for their scheming."
"It is He who enables you to travel over land and sea. When you sail in ships in a favourable breeze, you rejoice. But when a gale begins to blow and the waves dash against them from every side they realise that they have been caught in it, (and) they call on God in all faith: ""If You save us from this we shall ever be grateful.""",21,10,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُسَيِّرُكُمْ فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا كُنتُمْ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ وَجَرَيْنَ بِهِم بِرِيحٍ طَيِّبَةٍ وَفَرِحُوا۟ بِهَا جَآءَتْهَا رِيحٌ عَاصِفٌ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْجُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ أُحِيطَ بِهِمْ دَعَوُا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ لَئِنْ أَنجَيْتَنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِۦ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"It is Allah Who makes people travel on the land, on foot or riding, and it is He Who makes them travel in ships on the sea. They sail in them with a good wind, which the people in them are glad about. Then a gale wind comes to them, and the waves of the sea come to them from every side, until when they are certain they will be destroyed they start to call upon Allah alone, not associating anything with Him, saying: 'If You save us from this deadly situation we will be truly thankful for what You have blessed us with.'"
"But when He rescues them, they commit excesses in the land unjustly again. Your rebellion, O people, shall recoil back on your own selves. The joys of the world (are only ephemeral): You have to come back to Us in the end. We shall then inform you what you were doing.",22,10,فَلَمَّآ أَنجَىٰهُمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَبْغُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّمَا بَغْيُكُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِكُم مَّتَٰعَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"But when He answers their prayer, and saves them from their distress, they cause corruption in the earth, disbelieving and committing wrongdoing and sins. Wake up and realise O People! The evil consequences of your sins and transgression only falls upon yourselves and does not hurt Allah in any way. They enjoy it in the life of this world which is passing, and then they return to Allah on the day of Judgement, and He will inform them of the wrongdoing they used to do, and repay them for it."
"The life of the world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which are used as food by men and cattle. But when the earth is embellished and adorned with gold, and its tillers begin to feel that (the crops) are under control, Our command descends suddenly at night or in the day, and We mow them down as though there was nothing there yesterday. This is how We distinctly explain Our signs to those who think.",23,10,إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَٱخْتَلَطَ بِهِۦ نَبَاتُ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمُ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَخَذَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا وَٱزَّيَّنَتْ وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَآ أَنَّهُمْ قَٰدِرُونَ عَلَيْهَآ أَتَىٰهَآ أَمْرُنَا لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَٰهَا حَصِيدًا كَأَن لَّمْ تَغْنَ بِٱلْأَمْسِ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"The example of the life of this world, and the enjoyment in it, and how quickly it comes to an end, is that of the rain which is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which people eat grains and fruits, and animals benefit from its vegetation. When the earth has taken on its bright colour and looks beautiful because of the different plants growing on it, and the people think that they will be able to harvest and gather what has grown, Allah’s command comes to destroy it, so as if it had been harvested and not been full of anything. This is how Allah makes clear the true reality of the wroldly life and how He expounds upon His verses and signs so you may think about them and take a powerful lesson."
"God invites you to mansions of peace, and guides whosoever He will to the path that is straight",24,10,وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ دَارِ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"And Allah calls all people to His Paradise which is the Home of Peace, where people will be safe from difficulties and worries, and safe from death; and Allah enables whom He wills of His servants to come to Islam, guiding and leading them to this Home of Peace."
"For those who do good there is goodness and more, and no blot or disgrace will cover their faces. They are people of Paradise, where they will abide for ever.",25,10,لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ وَلَا يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ وَلَا ذِلَّةٌ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Those who do good, including that which Allah made obligatory on them, and stay away from the sins that Allah has prohibited, will receive the best reward, which is Paradise, and even more, which is to see the noble face of Allah. Neither dust, nor humiliation nor disgrace will cover their faces. Such people who do good are the companions of Paradise, where they will remain eternally."
"But those who earn evil shall be punished to an equal degree as their evil, and they will be covered with shame, and will have none to protect them against God: Their faces shall be blackened as though with patches of the night. They are the people of Hell, where they will abide for ever,",26,10,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَسَبُوا۟ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ جَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍۭ بِمِثْلِهَا وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ مَّا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ كَأَنَّمَآ أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ قِطَعًا مِّنَ ٱلَّيْلِ مُظْلِمًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Those who do bad actions – disbelieving and doing wrong – will receive equal repayment in the Afterlife for the sins they committed in this life. Their faces will be covered in humiliation and disgrace, and there will be no one to save them from the punishment that Allah will give them. It will be as if their faces were covered by patches of blackness of the dark night because of the great amount of smoke and blackness that will reach them from the fire of Hell. Such people are the companions of the fire of Hell, where they will live eternally."
"The day We shall gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters: ""Take your stand with the compeers you worshipped as the equals of God."" We shall then create a rift between them, and the compeers will say: ""You did not worship us;",27,10,وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَآؤُكُمْ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ وَقَالَ شُرَكَآؤُهُم مَّا كُنتُمْ إِيَّانَا تَعْبُدُونَ,"And remember O Messenger, the Day of Judgement, when Allah will gather together all of creation, and will tell those who associated partners with Allah in the world to stay in their place – they and the ‘gods’ they used to worship beside Allah. Then He will separate those who were worshipped from those who worshipped them; and those who were worshipped will free themselves from those who worshipped them, saying, ‘It was not us you worshipped’."
"For God is sufficient as witness between us and you we were not aware of your worship.""",28,10,فَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًۢا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِن كُنَّا عَنْ عِبَادَتِكُمْ لَغَٰفِلِينَ,"Their so called gods dissasociate themselves from them, saying that Allah is sufficient as a witness that they were not happy being worshipped by them, nor did they command them to do so, nor were they aware of their worship of them!"
"Then each will see what he had done in the past; and they will turn to God, their true Lord, and all the lies they had fabricated will be of no avail to them.",29,10,هُنَالِكَ تَبْلُوا۟ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّآ أَسْلَفَتْ وَرُدُّوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَوْلَىٰهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"In that great place each soul will be informed of what it did in the life of the world. Then the idolaters will return to their true Lord, Who is Allah, Who has power over their reckoning, and the intercession of idols that they made up will be non-existent."
"Ask them: ""Who gives you food and sustenance from the skies and the earth? Or, who is the lord of ear and eye? And who brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living? And who directs all affairs?"" They will say: ""God."" So tell them: ""Why do you not fear Him?""",30,10,قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَىَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَىِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ ٱلْأَمْرَ فَسَيَقُولُونَ ٱللَّهُ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"Say O Messenger to these idolators, 'Who is it that provides for you from the sky, sending down rain; who provides for you from the earth, with the plants that grow in it and what it contains of metals and minerals; and who brings the living from the dead, like humanity from a drop of semen and the bird from the egg; and who brings the dead from the living, like semen from animals, and the egg from the bird? And who governs everything in the heavens and the earth and what has been created in them? They will reply that Allah is the One Who does all of this. Say to them that, if they know this, they should be mindful of Him, following what Allah instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited."
"Such then is God, your true Lord; and when truth is gone what is left but error? So why do you turn away?",31,10,فَذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ ٱلْحَقِّ إِلَّا ٱلضَّلَٰلُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,"The One who does all of that O people is Allah, The Truth, your Creator and the Manager of your affairs. Then besides truth, what is there except error and loss? How do you turn away from the clear truth, with its proofs, to falsehood whims and desires?"
"Thus the word of your Lord about those who disobey comes true, that they do not believe.",32,10,كَذَٰلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Just as the Lordship of Allah is established, His Decree has also been established; that those who turn away from the truth out of pride will not have faith."
"Ask them: ""Is there among the partners (you ascribe to God) one who first originates then reverts it? Say: ""It is God alone who first creates and then reverts it. So where do you stray?""",33,10,قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُم مَّن يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,"Say to them O Messenger: 'Is there are any of their ‘partners’ who they worship beside Allah, who originate creation from nothing, and bring it back to life after death?' Tell them: 'Allah originates creation from nothing, and then brings it back to life after death, so how can you O idolaters turn away from the truth to falsehood?'"
"Ask: ""Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?"" Say: ""It is God who shows the way to truth."" Then who is more worthy of being followed -- He who guides to the truth, or he who cannot find the path until shown the way? What has happened to you that you judge in such a wise?",34,10,قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُم مَّن يَهْدِىٓ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَهْدِى لِلْحَقِّ أَفَمَن يَهْدِىٓ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَن يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّن لَّا يَهِدِّىٓ إِلَّآ أَن يُهْدَىٰ فَمَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,"Say to them O messenger: 'Is there are any of their ‘partners’ who they worship beside Allah, one who guides to the truth? Is He Who guides people to the truth and calls them to it more worthy of being followed, or your so-called gods which cannot guide themselves unless they are guided? What is wrong with you that you judge so falsely, claiming that they are ‘partners’ to Allah? Allah is far above what you say.'"
Many of them follow nothing but illusion; yet illusion cannot replace the reality. God verily knows what they do.,35,10,وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ إِلَّا ظَنًّا إِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لَا يُغْنِى مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"Most of the idolaters only follow matters that they have no knowledge about, only guessing and assuming. Mere assumption cannot take the place of knowledge and can be of no use against it. Allah knows all that they do, nothing of what they do is hidden from Him, and they will be rewarded accordingly."
"This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God. It confirms what has been revealed before, and is an exposition of (Heaven's) law. Without any doubt it's from the Lord of all the worlds.",36,10,وَمَا كَانَ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانُ أَن يُفْتَرَىٰ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ ٱلَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"This Qur’ān, miraculous in its eloquence and law-giving, could not be fabricated, and it cannot be attributed to anyone but Allah, because people are not capable of coming up with anything similar to it. Rather, it confirms the scriptures that were revealed before it, and clarifies the laws in it, and there is no doubt that it was revealed by the Lord of all created things."
"Do they say (of the Prophet) that: ""He has composed it?"" Say to them: ""Bring a Surah like this, and call anyone apart from God you can (to help you), if what you say is true.""",37,10,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ قُلْ فَأْتُوا۟ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِۦ وَٱدْعُوا۟ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Or do these idolaters say that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) came up with the Qur’ān himself claiming that it is from Allah? Say to them O Messenger, 'If I as a human being like you, have been able to come up with it, then you also should bring a chapter like it, and call upon whomever you wish to assist you, if you are telling the truth in claiming that the Qur’ān is not really from Allah. But you have not be able to do so, even though you are talented and eloquent in the language – showing you that the Qur’ān has been revealed by Allah.'"
"In fact, they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge, whose explanation has not reached them yet. So had those who have gone before them denied; but look at the fate of the unjust",38,10,بَلْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُوا۟ بِعِلْمِهِۦ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Yet the disbelievers do not respond to these challenges, but reject the Qur’ān before even thinking about it, without understanding it, and the punishment about which they have been warned has not yet come to them, although it is near!. In the same way, past communities rejected the truth, and Allah sent His punishment upon them. So reflect upon the end of these communities who rejected the truth, because they were destroyed by Allah."
"Some of them will believe in it, some will not. Your Lord knows the transgressors well.",39,10,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"There are idolaters who believe in the Qur’ān before their death, and there are those who do not believe in it out of stubbornness and pride until they die. Allah knows best those who persist in their disbelief and ingratitude, and will repay them for their actions."
"If they (still) call you a liar, tell them: ""For me my actions, for you yours. You are not answerable for my deeds, nor I for what you do.""",40,10,وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّى عَمَلِى وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُم بَرِيٓـُٔونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَا۠ بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"If they reject you O Messenger, then you will be rewarded for what you do, and your actions are your responsibility; and that they will be repaid for what they do, and they will have to deal with the consequences of their actions. They will not be responsible for what happens to you, and you are free from what happens to them."
Some of them listen to you: But can you make the deaf hear who do not understand a thing?,41,10,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ وَلَوْ كَانُوا۟ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"And some of the idolaters listen to you O Messenger as you recite the Qur’ān not wanting to accept it and follow it. Are you able to make deaf people hear? Likewise you cannot guide those who are deaf to the truth, as they will not understand it."
Some of them look toward you: But can you show the blind the way even when they cannot see?,42,10,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنظُرُ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنتَ تَهْدِى ٱلْعُمْىَ وَلَوْ كَانُوا۟ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ,"And from them are those who see you O Messenger with their normal eyesight, but not with the vision of insight. Is it possible for you to make the blind see? You are not able to do so, and likewise you is unable to guide those who lack perception and understanding."
Surely God does not wrong anyone; they wrong themselves.,43,10,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ ٱلنَّاسَ شَيْـًٔا وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Without doubt, Allah is far too High and Exalted that He would wrong people, and He does not wrong them by even the weight of an atom. Rather, it is they who wrong themselves, bringing about their own ruin because of clinging to falsehood, pride and stubbornness."
"The day He will gather them together it will appear to them that they had lived (in the world) but an hour of a day to make each other's acquaintance. Verily those who deny the meeting with God will be lost, and not find the way.",44,10,وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ,"On the day that Allah gathers people on the Day of Judgement, to bring them to account, it will be as if they had lived on earth and then waited after death for the Day of Judgement for only an hour, and no more. They will recognise each other on that day, but then their acquaintances will be cut off from them because of the intensity of the terrors they witness on the Day of Judgement. The losers will be those who rejected the meeting with their Lord on the Day of Judgement and who did not believe in the day or resurrection so that they could safeguard themselves from loss."
"Whether We show you some of the promise (of punishment in wait) for them, or take you to Ourself, their returning is to Us in the end; and God is a witness to all they do.",45,10,وَإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ ٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"Regardless of whether Allah shows the Messenger (peace be upon him)some of the punishment He promises them before his death, or He makes him die before this, they will return to Allah on the Day of Judgement. Moreover, Allah is a witness to what they used to do, none of it being hidden from Him, and they will be repaid for their actions."
"For every people there is an apostle; and when their apostle is come the matter is decided between them equitably, and no one is wronged.",46,10,وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"Every past nation had a messenger sent to them. When the messenger delivered to them what he was instructed to, and they rejected him, it was judged justly between him and them. Allah saved the messenger out of His grace, and destroyed them through His justice; and they were not wronged in any way in the repayment for what they did."
"They say: ""When is this promise going to come, if what you say is true?""",47,10,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"The stbborn disbelievers say: 'When will the punishment you promised to us occur, if you are telling the truth.'"
"Say: ""I have no power over my own gain or loss other than what God may please."" Every people have a certain term. When their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it a moment forward.",48,10,قُل لَّآ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِى ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا إِلَّا مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَلَا يَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"Say to them O Messenger, 'I have no control over anything benefiting or harming me, so how can I control benefit or harm for other people, apart from what Allah wills? How then do I know the Ghaib? Allah has appointed a set time for the destruction of every nation; but only Allah knows the times. If the time of your destruction has arrived, it cannot be brought forward or delayed by even a second.'"
"Say: ""Have you ever thought if His punishment befalls you at night or in the day, what would the sinners do to despatch it?",49,10,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتَىٰكُمْ عَذَابُهُۥ بَيَٰتًا أَوْ نَهَارًا مَّاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"Say O Messenger to these people who wish to hasten on the punishment: 'Inform me if the punishment of Allah came toy ou at any time of the night or day, what is it of this punishment exactly that you want to be brought quickly– happiness and joy? Or would it be sorrow and regret? Therefore, you should not seek to hasten it.'"
"Will you believe it when it comes to pass? Indeed, you will believe it then. How impatient you were to hasten it!",50,10,أَثُمَّ إِذَا مَا وَقَعَ ءَامَنتُم بِهِۦٓ ءَآلْـَٰٔنَ وَقَدْ كُنتُم بِهِۦ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,"Or is it that they will believe after the promised punishment has come down upon them, when believing will not benefit anyone who had not previously brought faith? Is it now that they will believe? And before they were seeking to hasten it because they did not believe in it?!"
"Then will the sinners be told: ""Now taste everlasting torment. Should you be rewarded for anything else but what you did?""",51,10,ثُمَّ قِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,"Then when they have been made to enter the punishment and they will seek to be removed from it, it will be said to them: 'Taste the everlasting torment of the Hereafter. Are you not being repaid except for your disbelief and disobedience?"
"Yet they want to be informed if it is true. Say: ""By my Lord, it is the truth. You cannot invalidate it.""",52,10,وَيَسْتَنۢبِـُٔونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلْ إِى وَرَبِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَحَقٌّ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,The idolaters ask you O Messenger f this punishment which they have been promised is true? Tell them: 'By Allah! It is the very truth and you cannot get away from it.'
"Even if every soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the earth, it would surely offer it to ransom itself, and feel repentant on seeing the punishment. Yet the sentence would be passed with justice, and not one will be wronged.",53,10,وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِكُلِّ نَفْسٍ ظَلَمَتْ مَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لَٱفْتَدَتْ بِهِۦ وَأَسَرُّوا۟ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"If every person who associated partners with Allah possessed all the valuable wealth on earth, they would offer it as ransom from Allah’s punishment if they were given the opportunity to do so. The idolaters will conceal their regret for their disbelief when they see the punishment on the Day of Judgement. Allah will decide between them with justice and they will not be wronged, and they will only be repaid for their actions."
"For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Remember, the promise of God is true. But most of them do not know.",54,10,أَلَآ إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَلَآ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"The control of whatever is in the heavens and earth is only Allah’s. Allah’s promise of punishment for the disbelievers will undoubtedly occur, but most of them do not know that and are therefore in doubt."
"He is the giver of life and death, and to Him you will return.",55,10,هُوَ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, raises the dead and causes the living to die. It is to Him alone that you will be returned on the Day of Judgement. He will then repay you for your actions."
"O men, a warning has come to you from your Lord, a remedy for the (doubts) of the heart, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.",56,10,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُم مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَآءٌ لِّمَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"O people, now this Qur’ān has come to you, a powerful reminder, encouragement and warning. It is a cure for the illnesses of doubt and uncertainty that are in the hearts. It contains guidance to the path of truth and is a mercy for the believers, who are the ones who benefit from it."
"Say: ""It is the blessing and mercy of God; so rejoice in it. It is better than all that you amass.""",57,10,قُلْ بِفَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِۦ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُوا۟ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the people: The Qur’ān that Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought to you is Allah’s grace and mercy to you. So rejoice in Allah’s grace and mercy to you by way of the revelation of this Qur’ān, and not in anything besides this. What Muhammad (peace be upon him)brought to them from His Lord is better than the temporary and trivial things of this world."
"Say: ""Have you thought of what God has sent you for food, of which you have labelled some as lawful and some forbidden?"" And ask: ""Has God commanded this, or you are imputing lies to God?""",58,10,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُم مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ فَجَعَلْتُم مِّنْهُ حَرَامًا وَحَلَٰلًا قُلْ ءَآللَّهُ أَذِنَ لَكُمْ أَمْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَفْتَرُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Tell me about Allah’s favour to you by way of the provision that He sent down, which you treated as you wished by making some unlawful and some lawful. Also, say to them: Did Allah give you permission in declaring those things lawful or unlawful, or are you making up lies about Allah?"
What do those who invent lies of God think about the Day of Reckoning? (Will they escape the judgement?) In fact God is gracious to men; but most of them are not grateful.,59,10,وَمَا ظَنُّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ,What do those who invent lies about Allah think will happen to them on the Day of Judgement? Do they think they will be forgiven? Never! Allah is Bountiful to people by giving them respite and not punishing them immediately; but most people deny Allah’s favours to them and are not grateful for them.
"There is no state you are in, whether reading from the Qur'an, or doing something else, but We are watching you as you are engaged in it. There is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous Book.",60,10,وَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُوا۟ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلَا تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلَّا كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ وَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَن رَّبِّكَ مِن مِّثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلَآ أَصْغَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَآ أَكْبَرَ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"You, O Messenger, do not get involved in any matter, nor do you recite any portion of the Qur’ān, nor do you, O believers, do any action, except that I see you. I know about you when you act, and I hear you. The weight of an atom, in the sky or on earth, is not hidden from the knowledge of your Lord. Nor is there anything lesser or more in weight, except that it is recorded in a clear book that does not omit anything, no matter how small or big it may be."
"Remember, there is neither fear nor regret for the friends of God.",61,10,أَلَآ إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,The friends of Allah will not have any fear of the terrors to come on the Day of Rising and they will not grieve over the pleasures of the world that they missed.
"Those who believe and obey God,",62,10,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ يَتَّقُونَ,The friends of Allah are those who possess the qualities of having faith in Allah and following His Messenger; they are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions.
For them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come. There is no changing the words of God. That will be the great triumph.,63,10,لَهُمُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"There is good news for these friends of Allah from their Lord, which will make them happy in the life of this world by means of good dreams and praise from people. They will also receive good news from the angels when they take away their souls. Allah’s promise will never be broken. That reward is the great success because it entails the fulfilment of their desires and salvation from what they fear."
You should not be grieved by what they say. All glory is wholly for God: He is the one who hears and knows everything.,64,10,وَلَا يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Do not grieve, O Messenger, over what these people say in an attempt to insult or attack your religion. All power and dominion belongs to Allah. Nothing is outside His ability. He is the One Who hears their statements and knows their actions, and He will repay them for that."
"Remember, whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Those who call on others they associate with God, follow nothing but conjecture, and only guess.",65,10,أَلَآ إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ,"The control of whoever is in the heavens and earth is only Allah’s. What is it that the idolaters who worship partners besides Allah are following? In reality, they are only following doubt and they are only lying when they attribute partners to Allah. Allah is far above their statements."
"It is He who made the night for you to rest, and made the day enlightening. Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen.",66,10,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ لِتَسْكُنُوا۟ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَارَ مُبْصِرًا إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,"It is He alone Who has made the night for you, O people, to take rest from tiredness. He has made the day bright for you to work and earn your livelihood. In that there are clear evidence for a people who listen with a view to being mindful and accepting."
"They say: ""God has begotten a son."" Immaculate is He and self-sufficient."" Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. You have no proof for this (assertion): Why do you say things of God you do not know?",67,10,قَالُوا۟ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَدًا سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِنْ عِندَكُم مِّن سُلْطَٰنٍۭ بِهَٰذَآ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Some of the idolaters said, ‘Allah has taken the angels as daughters’. Allah is free of their statement. He, may He be glorified, is Self-sufficient and is not in need of any of His creation. The control of whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His. You, O idolaters, do not have any proof for this statement of yours. Are you saying such a serious statement about Allah – by attributing a child to Him – even though you do not know the reality of this and you have no proof?"
"Say: ""Those who fabricate lies about God will never succeed.""",68,10,قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ,"Say to them, O Messenger: Those who invent lies about Allah – by attributing a child to Him – will not achieve what they desire and will not be saved from what they fear."
Let them profit by the world (while they may): In the end they will come back to Us. Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied (the truth).,69,10,مَتَٰعٌ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْفُرُونَ,They should not be deceived by the luxuries of the world they enjoy. This is a brief and temporary enjoyment and then they will return to Me on the Day of Judgement. I will then make them taste the fierce punishment because of their disbelief in Me and rejection of My Messenger.
"Recount to them the story of Noah when he said to his people: ""O people, if you find my staying with you and warning through God's signs, unbearable to you, know that I have reposed my trust in God. So plan your move, and call your associates, and make certain of your plan; then do whatever you intend against me, allowing me no respite.",70,10,وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ نُوحٍ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِۦ يَٰقَوْمِ إِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُم مَّقَامِى وَتَذْكِيرِى بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ فَأَجْمِعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً ثُمَّ ٱقْضُوٓا۟ إِلَىَّ وَلَا تُنظِرُونِ,"Relate, O Messenger, to these denying idolaters the story of Noah (peace be with him) when he said to his people: O my people, if my being amongst you is hard for you, and my reminding you of Allah’s signs and advising you is too difficult, and you have resolved to kill me, so I place my reliance in Allah alone to make your plots fail. So make a firm decision about your matter: resolve to destroy me and call your gods to help you and do not let your plot be an obscure secret. After your plan to kill me, go ahead and finish what you secretly intend and do not give me a moment of respite."
"If you turn away from me (remember) I do not ask any recompense from you. My reward is with God; I have been commanded to be one of those who submit to Him.""",71,10,فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَمَا سَأَلْتُكُم مِّنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"If you ignore my invitation, then you know that I have not asked for any reward from you for my conveying the message of my Lord to you. My reward is only from Allah, whether you have faith in me or not. Allah has instructed me to be of those who devote themselves to Him with obedience and good actions."
"Even then they denied him; so We saved him and those with him, in the ark, and established them in the land, and drowned those who denied Our signs. So think of the fate of those who were warned (and took no heed).",72,10,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُۥ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ خَلَٰٓئِفَ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,"Noah’s people denied him and did not accept him. I therefore saved him and those believers who were with him in the ship. I made them the successors of those before them; and I destroyed those who rejected the signs and evidence that he brought by means of the Flood. So reflect, O Messenger, over the fate of the people who were warned by Noah (peace be with him) but did not believe."
Afterwards We sent many messengers who brought clear proofs to their peoples. But they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied. That is how We seal the hearts of the iniquitous.,73,10,ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ رُسُلًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَآءُوهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانُوا۟ لِيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِمَا كَذَّبُوا۟ بِهِۦ مِن قَبْلُ كَذَٰلِكَ نَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"Then, after a period of time, We sent, after Noah, messengers to their people. The messenger came to their communities with overwhelming miracles and pure laws. But they had no intention to believe on account of their previous insistence on rejection of the messengers. Allah therefore sealed their hearts. Just as We sealed the hearts of the followers of the messengers of the past We will seal the hearts of the disbelievers who overstep Allah’s limits by committing disbelief in every time and place."
"Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles; but they behaved arrogantly, for they were a people full of guilt.",74,10,ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِم مُّوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا مُّجْرِمِينَ,"After a period of time, following these messengers, I sent Moses and his brother, Aaron, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and the nobles from his people. I sent them with miracles indicating their truthfulness, but the people of Pharaoh were too proud to accept what the messengers brought. They were a sinful people because of their disbelief in Allah and rejection of His messengers."
"Thus, when the truth had come to them from Us, they said: ""Surely this is nothing but pure magic.""",75,10,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"When the truth was brought by Moses and Aaron (peace be upon them) to Pharaoh and the nobles from his people, they said: These miracles – of the staff and the hand – that Moses has brought is clear magic and is not the revealed truth."
"""You say this of the truth,"" said Moses, ""after it has come to you. Is this magic? But sorcerers do not ever prosper.""",76,10,قَالَ مُوسَىٰٓ أَتَقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَكُمْ أَسِحْرٌ هَٰذَا وَلَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّٰحِرُونَ,"Moses said to them in disapproval: Are you calling the truth, when it has come to you, magic? Never! This is not magic. I know that a magician can never be successful, so why would I practise magic?"
"""Have you come,"" said they, ""to turn us back from what we found our ancestors doing, so that the two of you may attain supremacy in the land? We shall not believe in what you say.",77,10,قَالُوٓا۟ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا ٱلْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The people of Pharaoh gave Moses the following response: Have you brought this magic to turn us away from the religion we found our fathers following, so that you and your brother can gain control of us? We are not going to believe you two, O Moses and Aaron."
"""Bring the cleverest magicians to me,"" said the Pharaoh.",78,10,وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱئْتُونِى بِكُلِّ سَٰحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ,"Pharaoh said to his people, ‘Bring me every person who is knowledgeable and skilled in magic’."
"So when the magicians arrived, Moses said to them: ""Cast whatever (spell) you have to cast.""",79,10,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالَ لَهُم مُّوسَىٰٓ أَلْقُوا۟ مَآ أَنتُم مُّلْقُونَ,"When the magicians were brought to Pharaoh, Moses (peace be upon him) said to them with full faith that he would defeat them, ‘Throw down, O magicians, whatever you have to throw’."
"When they had cast (their spell) Moses said: ""What you have cast is only a charm which God will surely nullify. God does not verily render the deeds of evil-doers righteous.",80,10,فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَوْا۟ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ مَا جِئْتُم بِهِ ٱلسِّحْرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"When they threw down their magical spells, Moses (peace be upon him) said to them: What you have shown is magic. Allah will cause what you have done to be nothing and of no effect. You cause corruption on earth by means of your magic and Allah does not set right the action of a person who causes corruption."
"God vindicates the truth by His commands, however the sinners may dislike it.""",81,10,وَيُحِقُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"Allah will establish the truth and give it weight with His words of decree and with the proof and evidence contained in His words of law, even though the sinful disbelievers from the people of Pharaoh dislike it."
"But none of them put faith in Moses except some youths among his people who were nonetheless afraid lest the Pharaoh and his nobles should persecute them; for the Pharaoh was mighty in the land, and guilty of excesses.",82,10,فَمَآ ءَامَنَ لِمُوسَىٰٓ إِلَّا ذُرِّيَّةٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِۦ عَلَىٰ خَوْفٍ مِّن فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِمْ أَن يَفْتِنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ لَعَالٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"The people resolved to turn away and none accepted Moses (peace be upon him), despite the open miracles and clear proof he brought, besides a few youth from his people, the Israelites. Those who persisted in rejection did so out of fear that Pharaoh and the nobles from his people would turn them away from their faith by imposing a punishment on them if they came to know of their belief. Pharaoh was high-handed in his authority over Egypt and its people, and he was of those who overstepped the limit with respect to disbelief and in killing and punishing the Israelites."
"Moses said: ""O my people, if you do believe in God place your trust in Him if you are obedient.""",83,10,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يَٰقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءَامَنتُم بِٱللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُوٓا۟ إِن كُنتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to his people, ‘O my people, if you have true faith in Allah, place your reliance in Him alone, if you have submitted. Placing reliance in Allah will protect you from harm and will bring you good’."
"They answered: ""We have placed our trust in God. O Lord, do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people,",84,10,فَقَالُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"They responded to Moses (peace be upon him) and said to him: In Allah alone we place our trust. O our Lord, do not give the wrongdoers power over us because they will try to take us away from our religion by inflicting punishments on us, by killing us and by tempting us."
"And deliver us by Your grace from a people who do not believe.""",85,10,وَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Rescue us through Your mercy, O our Lord, from the hands of the people of Pharaoh who are disbelievers, because they have made us into slaves and have harmed us by inflicting punishments on us and by killing us."
"We commanded Moses and his brother: ""Build homes for your people in Egypt, and make your houses places of worship, perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe.""",86,10,وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَأَخِيهِ أَن تَبَوَّءَا لِقَوْمِكُمَا بِمِصْرَ بُيُوتًا وَٱجْعَلُوا۟ بُيُوتَكُمْ قِبْلَةً وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"I revealed to Moses and his brother, Aaron (peace be upon them), that they should select and make homes for their people to worship Me alone; that they should make their homes face the direction of the qiblah (which was then Jerusalem); and that they should perform the ritual prayer with perfection. I also told Moses to inform the believers of news that will please them: the news of My assistance and support for them; My destruction of their enemy; and My making them successors on earth."
"And Moses said: ""O Lord, have You bestowed on the Pharaoh and his nobles pomp and plenty in the life of this world that they might mislead people from Your path? Destroy their possessions, O Lord, and harden their hearts that they may not believe until they face the painful punishment.""",87,10,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ ءَاتَيْتَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَأَهُۥ زِينَةً وَأَمْوَٰلًا فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا رَبَّنَا لِيُضِلُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِكَ رَبَّنَا ٱطْمِسْ عَلَىٰٓ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَٱشْدُدْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلْأَلِيمَ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said: O our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and the nobles from his people the glitz and glamour of this world. You have also given them wealth in this worldly life; but they were not grateful to You for what You gave them. Instead, they used that to mislead others from Your path. O our Lord, utterly destroy their wealth. Make their hearts hard so that they do not believe, unless they see the painful punishment at a time when their belief will be of no benefit to them."
"Said (the Lord): ""Your prayer is answered. Therefore persist and do not follow the path of those who are ignorant.""",88,10,قَالَ قَدْ أُجِيبَت دَّعْوَتُكُمَا فَٱسْتَقِيمَا وَلَا تَتَّبِعَآنِّ سَبِيلَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,Allah said to Moses and Aaron that He had accepted their prayer against Pharaoh and the nobles from his people. He instructed them to remain firm on their religion and not to deviate from it by following the path of the ignorant ones who do not know the path of truth.
"And We brought the people of Israel across the sea, but the Pharaoh and his army pursued them wickedly and maliciously till he was on the point of drowning, and he said: ""I believe that there is no god but He in whom the people of Israel believe, and I submit to Him.""",89,10,وَجَٰوَزْنَا بِبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ وَجُنُودُهُۥ بَغْيًا وَعَدْوًا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ ٱلْغَرَقُ قَالَ ءَامَنتُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَامَنَتْ بِهِۦ بَنُوٓا۟ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَأَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"I made the Israelites safely cross the sea after I split it open. Pharaoh and his troops pursued them out of oppression and enmity. Then, when the sea closed on him, bringing them to the point of drowning and he lost all hope of being saved, he said, ‘I believe that there is no being worthy of worship besides the One Whom the Israelites have accepted, and I am one of those who submit to Allah by following Him’."
"""Yes, now"" (was the answer), ""though before this you were disobedient and rebellious.",90,10,ءَآلْـَٰٔنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"Do you believe now after losing hope of life? You, O Pharaoh, had gone against Allah before the punishment by disbelieving in Him and preventing others from His path and you were one of those who spread corruption because of your own misguidance and your leading others astray."
"We shall preserve your body today that you may be a lesson for those who come after you; as many a man is heedless of Our signs.""",91,10,فَٱلْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ ءَايَةً وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِنَا لَغَٰفِلُونَ,"So today I will take you out, O Pharaoh, from the sea and place you on a high piece of ground so that those who come after you can take a lesson from you. But many people are unmindful of My proof and evidence indicating My power, and they do not reflect over them."
"We gave the people of Israel a settled abode, and bestowed good things on them to eat and use. So they did not differ until they came to have knowledge. Your Lord will assuredly settle their differences on the Day of Resurrection.",92,10,وَلَقَدْ بَوَّأْنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ وَرَزَقْنَٰهُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ فَمَا ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"I settled the Israelites in a fine and excellent place in the blessed lands of the Levant; and I provided them with pure and lawful provision. They did not differ in the matter of religion until the Qur’ān came to them confirming what they read in the Torah about the description of Muhammad (peace be upon him). When they rejected the revelation, their homelands were taken away from them. Your Lord, O Messenger, will decide between them on the Day of Judgement regarding the things they differed about; and He will repay those who were on truth, as well as those who were false, with what they deserve."
"If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book (for a long time) before you. The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,",93,10,فَإِن كُنتَ فِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَسْـَٔلِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,"If you, O Messenger, are in doubt or confusion about the reality of the Qur’ān that I have revealed to you, then ask those Jews who read the Torah and the Christians who read the Gospel to confirm it. They will tell you that what was revealed to you is the truth because they have the description of it in their scriptures. The truth, about which there is no doubt, has come to you from your Lord, so do not be of those who have doubt."
"And do not be one of those who deny the signs of God, or you will be among the losers.",94,10,وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Do not be of those who deny Allah’s proof and evidence, because that will make you one of those who have lost their own souls by bringing them to the point of destruction because of their disbelief. All these warnings are meant to show the seriousness of doubt and denial, despite the fact that the Prophet is protected from such things."
"Verily those against whom the word of your Lord is pronounced will never believe,",95,10,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,Those against whom Allah’s decree – that they will die as disbelievers due to their insistence on it – is established will never believe –
"Even though all the signs came to them, not till they face the grievous punishment.",96,10,وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءَايَةٍ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلْأَلِيمَ,"Even if every explanatory or universal sign comes to them, until they witness the painful punishment and believe at a time when their belief will not benefit them."
"Why has there been no habitation that believed and profited by their faith, except the people of Jonah? When they came to believe, We removed from them the affliction of shame in the world, and made them prosperous for a time.",97,10,فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَٰنُهَآ إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُوا۟ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخِزْىِ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَٰهُمْ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Never did a town to which I sent messengers to believe in faith validly and beneficially and before seeing the punishment, except the people of Jonah. When they truly accepted faith, I removed the punishment of disgrace and humiliation from them in the worldly life, and I let them have enjoyment until the end of their lives."
"If your Lord had willed, all the people on the earth would have come to believe, one and all.",98,10,وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَءَامَنَ مَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ ٱلنَّاسَ حَتَّىٰ يَكُونُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"If your Lord, O Messenger, had willed for everyone on earth to believe, they would have done so. However, He did not will it to be so for a wise reason. He misguides whomever He wills through His justice; and He guides whomever He wills through His grace. You do not have the ability to force people to become believers: their guidance to faith lies only in Allah’s Hands."
Are you going to compel the people to believe except by God's dispensation? He puts doubt in (the minds of) those who do not think.,99,10,وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَن تُؤْمِنَ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَجْعَلُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"It is not possible for any soul to believe by itself unless Allah permits. Belief only happens with His will, so do not lose yourself in grief over them. Allah places suffering and disgrace on those who do not apply their minds to His proof, instructions and prohibitions."
"Say: ""Observe all there is in the heavens and the earth."" But signs or warnings will be of no avail to those who do not believe.",100,10,قُلِ ٱنظُرُوا۟ مَاذَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِى ٱلْءَايَٰتُ وَٱلنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to the idolaters who ask you for signs: Think about the signs that are in the heavens and the earth, which indicate Allah’s Oneness and power. Sending down signs and messengers are of no use for people who will not believe because of their insistence on disbelief."
"Can they expect anything but what the people before them had known? Say: ""Then wait. I am waiting with you.""",101,10,فَهَلْ يَنتَظِرُونَ إِلَّا مِثْلَ أَيَّامِ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قُلْ فَٱنتَظِرُوٓا۟ إِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُنتَظِرِينَ,"Are these denying people waiting for something similar to what Allah imposed on the past communities who had denied? Say, O Messenger, to them, ‘Wait for Allah’s punishment. I too am waiting with you for Allah’s promise’."
Thus do We deliver our apostles and those who believe. As a matter of duty We save the believers.,102,10,ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كَذَٰلِكَ حَقًّا عَلَيْنَا نُنجِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Then I will send down the punishment on them and I will save My messengers and those of faith with them, so that they are not injured by what hurts their people. Just as I saved those messengers and the believers with them, I will most certainly save Allah’s Messenger and the believers with him, which is My duty to them."
"Say: ""O men, if you have doubt about my faith, then (know) I do not worship those you worship apart from God, but I worship God who makes you die; and I am commanded to be a believer,",103,10,قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّن دِينِى فَلَآ أَعْبُدُ ٱلَّذِينَ تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنْ أَعْبُدُ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِى يَتَوَفَّىٰكُمْ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Say, O Messenger: O people, if you are in doubt about my religion which I call you towards, the religion of monotheism, then I am certain of your religion being false and I will therefore not follow it. I will not worship those whom you worship besides Allah, but I will only worship Allah, the One Who will cause you to die. He has instructed me to be of those who are sincere to Him in religion."
"And to set my face toward the way, as one upright, and not be one of those who associate others with God.",104,10,وَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"He has likewise instructed me to remain firm on the true religion, inclining away from all other religions, and He has prohibited me from being one of those who associate partners with Him."
"And not to invoke any other than God, who can neither help nor hurt me; for if I do, I would surely be unjust.",105,10,وَلَا تَدْعُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ فَإِن فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِّنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Do not worship, O Messenger, besides Allah, the idols and false gods that have no ability to benefit others, nor can they inflict harm on others. If you worship them, you will then be one of the wrongdoers who breaks Allah’s right and the right of their own souls."
"Should God bring you harm there is none but He who could deliver you from it, and if He wish you good there is none who could take away His blessings: He showers them on those of His creatures as He please, and He is forgiving and kind.""",106,10,وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُۥٓ إِلَّا هُوَ وَإِن يُرِدْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَلَا رَآدَّ لِفَضْلِهِۦ يُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَهُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"If Allah afflicts you, O Messenger, with a disaster and you desire to remove it, then know that no one can remove it except Him, may He be glorified. If He wants ease for you, then there is no one who can repel His grace. He makes His grace reach whomever He wills of His servants. No one can compel Him. He is Forgiving and Merciful to those of His servants who repent to Him."
"Say: ""O men, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so he who follows the right path does so for himself, and he who goes astray errs against himself, and I am not a guardian over you.",107,10,قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِى لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنَا۠ عَلَيْكُم بِوَكِيلٍ,"Say, O Messenger: O people, the Qur’ān has come to you as a revelation from your Lord. Whoever follows the right path and has faith in it, the benefit of that will return to him, because Allah is in no need of the obedience of His servants. Yet whoever strays, the effect of his straying will only harm him, because Allah is not affected by the disobedience of His servants. I am not a guardian over you, to watch over your actions and to take you to account for them."
"Follow what is revealed to you, and persist until God pronounce His judgement; for He is the best of all judges.""",108,10,وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ وَٱصْبِرْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَٰكِمِينَ,"Follow, O Messenger, what your Lord reveals to you and act on it. Be patient with the harms caused by those who oppose you from your people, whilst you convey the message as instructed. Remain firm on this path until Allah passes judgement with respect to them: by giving you victory over them in the world and by punishing them in the Afterlife, if they die as disbelievers."
"ALIF LAM RA. This is a Book whose verses are indeclinable and distinct, which comes from One who is most wise and all-knowing,",0,11,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓر كِتَٰبٌ أُحْكِمَتْ ءَايَٰتُهُۥ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ,"The discussion on the meaning of such verses has been previously mentioned in Sūrah Al-Baqarah. The Qur’ān is a book whose verses have been perfectly constructed, in which you will see no flaw nor any deficiency. Then it was explained by mention of the lawful and unlawful, instructions and prohibitions, promises and threats, narrations etc. It is from the One Who is Wise in His handling of affairs and legislation and Who is Aware of the condition of His servants and what is in their best interests."
"(Proclaiming) that you should worship none but God. Verily I bring to you from Him a message of warning and rejoicing,",1,11,أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ إِنَّنِى لَكُم مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ,"These verses revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) prohibit people from worshipping anyone besides Allah. I, O people, warn you of Allah’s punishment if you disbelieve in Him and do not obey Him; and I give you good news of His reward if you have faith in Him and practise His sacred law."
"And that you should seek His forgiveness and turn towards Him. He will bestow the best things of life on you for a time ordained, and favour those with blessings who are worthy of grace. But if you turn away, I fear the punishment of a terrible Day for you.",2,11,وَأَنِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُم مَّتَٰعًا حَسَنًا إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِى فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُۥ وَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ,"Seek, O people, forgiveness for your sins from your Lord and repent to Him with remorse over your shortcomings. He will give you good provision in this worldly life until the end of your fixed lifespan. He will give every person who has merit, by following Him and doing good, a full reward for such behaviour without any decrease. If you turn away from having faith in what I have brought from my Lord, then I fear for you the punishment of a day whose horrors are intense, which is the Day of Judgement."
"To God have you to go back, and He has power over everything.",3,11,إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"To Allah alone is your return, O people, on the Day of Judgement and He, may He be glorified, has power over everything. Nothing is outside His ability. It is not difficult for Him to give you life and take you to account after you die and are raised up."
"Look, how they double up their breasts in order to hide from Him. But when they cover themselves up with their garments, He knows what they hide and what they expose. Indeed, He knows the secrets of the hearts.",4,11,أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُوا۟ مِنْهُ أَلَا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"These idolaters bend their backs and lower their heads in order to hide from Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him). When they cover their heads with their clothing so that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) does not see them, turning away from what he brought, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He knows the intentions that are in the heart. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"There is not a creature that moves on the earth whose nourishment is not provided by God, whose place of sojourning and depositing is not known to Him. All things conform to a manifest law.",5,11,وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"There is no creature that walks on the surface of the earth, whatever it may be, except that Allah has undertaken, through His grace, to provide for it. He, may He be glorified, knows where it lives on earth and He knows where it will die. The provision, place of living and place of death for everything – including creatures – are in a clear book, which is the Preserved Tablet."
"It is He who created the heavens and the earth In six spans, and has control over the waters (of life) so that he may bring out the best that everyone of you could do. Yet if you said to them: ""You shall certainly be raised from the dead,"" the unbelievers will say: ""This will be nothing but sorcery.""",6,11,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in their magnificent form, and He created whatever is in them in a period of six days. Before He created them, His Throne was on water. He created all of this in order to test which of you, O people, is best in doing actions that please Allah and which of you does actions that anger Him. He will repay each group according to what they deserve. If you, O Messenger, say, ‘You, O people, will be resurrected after you die to be taken to account’, then those who disbelieve in Allah and reject the resurrection will say, ‘This Qur’ān that you recite is nothing but sheer magic and it is clearly false’."
"If We defer their punishment for a certain time, they will say: ""What is keeping it back?"" And yet, the day it comes, they will not be able to avert it; and what they used to laugh at will encompass them.",7,11,وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"If I postpone the punishment that the idolaters deserve in this world for a period of a few days, they will attempt to mock the punishment by asking for it to come quickly, by saying, ‘What is it that is holding the punishment back from us?’ Of course, the punishment that they deserve has a fixed time with Allah, and on the day when it comes to them they will not find anyone to avert it from them. Instead, the punishment that they used to poke fun at by asking for it to come quickly will fall upon them and surround them."
"If We allow man to enjoy Our favours, and then take them away from him, he becomes despondent and ungrateful.",8,11,وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌ كَفُورٌ,"If I give man a blessing from Me, such as health or wealth, and then I take away that blessing from him, he loses all hope of My mercy and becomes extremely ungrateful for My blessings, which he forgets when they are taken away."
"If We let him taste Our favours after adversity, he says: ""Misfortune has left me,"" and begins to brag and exult,",9,11,وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌ فَخُورٌ,"If I let such a person have much provision and good health, after having experienced poverty and illness, he will say, ‘My troubles have gone and my difficulty is over’. He does not thank Me for such blessings, but instead he becomes boastful and vain, holding his head high with pride over people because of what I have blessed him with."
"Except those who endure with patience and do the right, who will have pardon and a great reward.",10,11,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,"This is the case with all people except those who are patient in hard times, do good actions and leave sins. Such good people are different to the arrogant ones described previously, as they do not lose hope in hard times, nor are they ungrateful for Allah’s blessings and nor are they arrogant. So they will receive forgiveness for their sins from their Lord and they will receive a great reward in the Afterlife."
"You may haply omit some of what has been revealed to you, and may be disheartened because they say: ""Why was no treasure sent down to him, or an angel accompanied him?"" Yet you have been sent to warn alone, for God takes care of everything.",11,11,فَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكٌۢ بَعْضَ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ وَضَآئِقٌۢ بِهِۦ صَدْرُكَ أَن يَقُولُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ كَنزٌ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُۥ مَلَكٌ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ نَذِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,"Perhaps you, O Messenger, because of their disbelief, stubbornness and demand for signs, will leave out conveying some of what Allah has instructed you to convey because they will find it difficult to practise; and perhaps your heart will be reluctant to convey it, so that they do not say, ‘Why has no rich treasure been sent down to him or why has no angel come with him to confirm his truthfulness?’ Do not leave some of what is revealed to you because of that. You are only a warner who conveys what Allah has instructed you to convey. You do not have to bring the signs they request for. Allah takes care of everything."
"Do they say (of the Prophet): ""He has forged (the Qur'an)?"" Say: ""Then bring ten Surahs like it, and call anyone except God to help you, if what you say is true.""",12,11,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ قُلْ فَأْتُوا۟ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِۦ مُفْتَرَيَٰتٍ وَٱدْعُوا۟ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Do the idolaters say that Muhammad made up the Qur’ān, and that it is not revelation from Allah? Allah tells the Messenger (peace and blessing be upon him) to challenge them to write ten similar sūrahs themselves like the Qur’ān, and to call upon whomever they could call upon to help them to do this, if they were telling the truth in claiming that the Qur’ān was fabricated."
"If they do not answer you, then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He. (And say:) ""Will you now submit?""",13,11,فَإِلَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَكُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ بِعِلْمِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَن لَّآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"If they do not bring what the Messenger challenges them to – and they are unable to do it! – then the believers should know with certainty that the Qur’ān is revealed from Allah by His knowledge to His Messenger, and that it is not fabricated, and that there is no true god except for Him. Allah asks whether you surrender to Him in devotion after these conclusive proofs?"
"To those who desire the life of this world and its many allures, We shall pay them in full for their acts herein and will not withold any thing.",14,11,مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا نُوَفِّ إِلَيْهِمْ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ فِيهَا وَهُمْ فِيهَا لَا يُبْخَسُونَ,"Whoever desires the life of this world and its passing pleasures through what they do, and does not desire the Afterlife through their actions, Allah will give them the reward for their actions in this world: health, safety and ample provision. They will not be short-changed in the reward for their actions in any way."
"Yet these are the people for whom there is nothing but Fire in the world to come. Fruitless will be what they have fashioned, and whatever they have done will perish.",15,11,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ إِلَّا ٱلنَّارُ وَحَبِطَ مَا صَنَعُوا۟ فِيهَا وَبَٰطِلٌ مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Such people with this blameworthy aspiration will not have any reward on the Day of Judgement, except for the fire of Hell, which they will enter; and the reward of their actions will disappear, and their actions will be useless, because they were not based on faith or on a valid intention, and they did not desire the countenance of Allah and the home of the Afterlife through their actions."
"Will he who has a clear proof from his Lord, which acts as evidence from Him, before which the Book of Moses was a way-giver and a grace, (not believe in it)? Whoever among the partisans does not believe in it shall have Hell as the promised award. So have no doubt about it, for surely it's the truth from your Lord, though most men may not believe.",16,11,أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ وَمِن قَبْلِهِۦ كِتَٰبُ مُوسَىٰٓ إِمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلْأَحْزَابِ فَٱلنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُۥ فَلَا تَكُ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّنْهُ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)has a clear proof from His Lord, the Exalted, which is the noble Qur’ān that testifies to the truth of what he says; and the Torah, revealed to Moses (peace be upon him), also testifies to the truth of his prophethood. He was sent as a guide and a mercy to people. He and those who believe with him are not the same as the disbelievers, who wander aimlessly in error; for they believe in the Qur’ān and in Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), to whom the Qur’ān was revealed. As for those who disbelieve in it from the different groups, the fire of Hell will be their promised destination on the Day of Judgement. So the Messenger (peace be upon him)should not be in any doubt about the Qur’ān, and about their destination, because it is the truth, in which there is no doubt. However, most people do not have faith, despite the coming together of clear signs and evidence."
"Who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God? Such men shall be arraigned before their Lord, and the witnesses will testify: ""These are those who imputed lies to God."" Beware! The scourge of God will fall on the unjust,",17,11,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ٱلْأَشْهَٰدُ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أَلَا لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"No one is a greater wrongdoer than someone who makes up a lie about Allah, associating a partner or a son with Him. Those who make up lies about Allah will be brought before their Lord on the Day of Judgement to be asked about their actions, and the witnesses against them, from among the angels and the messengers, will say that they were the ones who lied about Allah by attributing a partner or son to Him. Allah’s depriving them of His mercy is due to their lies about Allah."
"Who obstruct others from the way of God and seek obliquity in it, and do not believe in the life to come.",18,11,ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"Those who turn people away from Allah’s straight path, and want it to be twisted from its straightness so that, who deny that they will be brought back to life after death –"
"They shall not weaken (the power of) God on earth, nor find any other protector but God. Their punishment will be doubled, for they could neither hear nor see.",19,11,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ يُضَٰعَفُ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يُبْصِرُونَ,"Such people cannot escape from Allah in this world if He wills to send down a punishment on them, and they have no protectors besides Allah who could stop the punishment of Allah from reaching them. Their punishment on the Day of Judgement will be increased because they turned away themselves and turned others away from Allah’s path. In this world, they were not able to hear the truth and guidance and accept it, and they did not see the signs of Allah in the universe in a way that was beneficial to them, because of their strong aversion to the truth."
"They are verily those who exceeded themselves, and the (gods) they invented abandoned them.",20,11,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"These are people who have lost themselves, heading towards their own ruin through associating partners with Allah; and the partners and intercessors they have invented will abandon them."
Undoubtedly they will be losers in the life to come.,21,11,لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرُونَ,"It is certain that on the Day of Judgement they will be the greatest losers, because they exchanged faith for disbelief, the Afterlife for the world, and mercy for suffering."
"But those who believe and do things good, and are humble before their Lord, are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever.",22,11,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَأَخْبَتُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Those who have faith in Allah and His messengers, and who do good actions, are humble and fear Allah, they are the companions of Paradise, where they will live eternally."
"The semblance of these two groups is that of a man who is deaf and blind, and the other who can hear and see. Can they be equal? Why do you not reflect?",23,11,مَثَلُ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ كَٱلْأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْأَصَمِّ وَٱلْبَصِيرِ وَٱلسَّمِيعِ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"The examples of the two groups – the disbelievers and the believers – are, firstly, like the blind who do not see and the deaf who do not hear: where it is the disbelievers who do not hear and accept the truth, and do not see in a way that is beneficial to them; and secondly, like someone who can hear and see: where it is the believers who can both hear and see. Are these two groups the same in their state and in their qualities? They are not the same. Will you not consider how truly different they are to each other? When the turning away from the faith by the idolaters became clear, Allah consoled His Prophet (peace be upon him), saying that he was not the first who had been rejected, and then He mentioned the stories of other prophets who had been treated in a similar way: The examples of the two groups – the disbelievers and the believers – are, firstly, like the blind who do not see and the deaf who do not hear: where it is the disbelievers who do not hear and accept the truth, and do not see in a way that is beneficial to them; and secondly, like someone who can hear and see: where it is the believers who can both hear and see. Are these two groups the same in their state and in their qualities? They are not the same. Will you not consider how truly different they are to each other?"
"We sent Noah to his people (and he said): ""I give you a clear warning.",24,11,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنِّى لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"I sent Noah (peace be upon him) as a messenger to his people. Noah told them that he was sent to warn them about Allah’s punishment, whilst making very clear the message he had been sent to them with."
"Do not worship anyone but God; for I fear the punishment of a dreadful day for you.""",25,11,أَن لَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Noah called his people to worship Allah alone, and not to worship any besides Him, because he feared the punishment of a painful day for them."
"The leaders of the people who were unbelievers, replied: ""We see that you are but a man like us, and see that none among us follows you but the meanest and immature of judgement, and do not see any excellence in you above us. In fact, we think you are a liar.""",26,11,فَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ مَا نَرَىٰكَ إِلَّا بَشَرًا مِّثْلَنَا وَمَا نَرَىٰكَ ٱتَّبَعَكَ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ أَرَاذِلُنَا بَادِىَ ٱلرَّأْىِ وَمَا نَرَىٰ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍۭ بَلْ نَظُنُّكُمْ كَٰذِبِينَ,"The nobility and leaders of Noah’s people said that they would not respond to his call, saying that he was no better than them, being a man like them, and that they only saw the least important people among them following him straightaway upon a simple suggestion, without considering carefully or examining the situation. They said that the believers were not more noble or wealthy than them, nor did they have a higher rank than them, which might make them worthy of being followed by them; rather, they considered them to be lying in their claims."
"He said: ""O my people, think. If I have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed on me His grace, though unknown to you, can we force it upon you when you are averse?",27,11,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى وَءَاتَىٰنِى رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِهِۦ فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا وَأَنتُمْ لَهَا كَٰرِهُونَ,"Noah asked his people to tell him whether he and the believers would be able to enter faith into his people’s hearts against their will if he had a clear proof from his Lord, showing that what he said was the truth, and that they must believe him? They would be unable to do so, because it is Allah alone Who gives people faith."
"I do not demand for it any wealth from you, O my people. My reward is with God. And I will not drive those away who believe. They have also to meet their Lord. But I see you are an ignorant people.",28,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ لَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مَالًا إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ بِطَارِدِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُوا۟ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَٰكِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ,"Noah told his people that he did not ask for any payment for the delivery of his message: his reward would only be from Allah. He would not drive away the poor among the believers, who the disbelievers asked to be removed from his company. They will be meeting their Lord on the Day of Judgement, and Allah will reward them for their faith. Noah said that he saw them as a people who did not understand the reality of what he was calling them to when they asked him to drive away the weak people among the believers."
"O my people, who will save me from God if I drive them away? Do you not understand?",29,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ مَن يَنصُرُنِى مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِن طَرَدتُّهُمْ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,Noah asked his people about who would be able to protect him from Allah’s punishment if he drove away these poor believers unjustly for no crime. Would they not reflect and strive for what was best and of most benefit to themselves?
"I say not that I have the treasures of God, or that I possess the knowledge of the unknown. I do not claim to be an angel, nor can I say that God will not bestow any good on those you disdain, for God is cognisant of what is in their hearts. If I say this, I will surely be unjust.""",30,11,وَلَآ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِندِى خَزَآئِنُ ٱللَّهِ وَلَآ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ وَلَآ أَقُولُ إِنِّى مَلَكٌ وَلَآ أَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ تَزْدَرِىٓ أَعْيُنُكُمْ لَن يُؤْتِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ خَيْرًا ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ إِنِّىٓ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Noah told his people that he would not say that he had the treasuries of Allah, which he could spend on them if they believed; and he would not say to them that he had knowledge of the Ghaib. He would not say to them that he was an angel, because he was a man like them; nor would he say of the poor people, whom they scorned and thought of as inferior to them, that Allah would not give them success and guidance: Allah knew best their intentions and their states. If Noah claimed any of these things, then he would be among the wrongdoers, deserving of Allah’s punishment."
"They said: ""O Noah, you have argued with us, and disputed at length; so bring that (retribution) you promise, if you speak the truth.""",31,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰنُوحُ قَدْ جَٰدَلْتَنَا فَأَكْثَرْتَ جِدَٰلَنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Noah’s people said to him, out of stubbornness and pride, that he had debated and disputed long enough, and told him to bring them the punishment he had promised them, if he was telling the truth in what he claimed."
"He replied: ""Only God will bring it on you if He please, and you cannot prevail against Him.",32,11,قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِيكُم بِهِ ٱللَّهُ إِن شَآءَ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,"Noah said to them that he could not bring the punishment upon them, and that only Allah would bring it to them, if He willed; and that they would not be able to escape from the punishment of Allah if He willed for them to be given a punishment."
"Even if I wish to advise you aright, my counsel will not profit you if God intend that you go astray, for He is your Lord and to Him you will return.""",33,11,وَلَا يَنفَعُكُمْ نُصْحِىٓ إِنْ أَرَدتُّ أَنْ أَنصَحَ لَكُمْ إِن كَانَ ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يُغْوِيَكُمْ هُوَ رَبُّكُمْ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Noah told them that his advice and counsel would not benefit them if Allah willed that they be led astray from the right path, and if He willed to leave them without guidance because of their stubbornness. He was their Lord and it was He Who had control over their lives, so He would lead them astray if He willed; and to Him alone they would be returned on the Day of Judgement, when they would be repaid for their actions."
"Do they say you have fabricated it? Tell them: ""If I have fabricated it, then mine is the guilt; but I am clear of what you are guilty.""",34,11,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ قُلْ إِنِ ٱفْتَرَيْتُهُۥ فَعَلَىَّ إِجْرَامِى وَأَنَا۠ بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تُجْرِمُونَ,"The disbelief of Noah’s people led them to claim that he had made up something about Allah with this faith that he brought to them. Allah told His messenger to say to them that if he had invented it, then he would be a wrongdoer and the punishment of his crime would fall upon him alone; and if they rejected the truth he brought them, out of stubbornness and pride, then they were the wrongdoers, and he was not responsible for their crime in any way, but was innocent of it."
"And Noah was informed through revelation: ""Apart from those who have come to believe already not one of your people is going to believe. So grieve not for what they are doing.",35,11,وَأُوحِىَ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ أَنَّهُۥ لَن يُؤْمِنَ مِن قَوْمِكَ إِلَّا مَن قَدْ ءَامَنَ فَلَا تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْعَلُونَ,"Allah revealed to Noah that none of his people would believe, except those who already believed; and He told him not to be saddened by their rejection and ridicule over the many years."
"Build an ark under Our eye and as We instruct. Do not plead for those who have been wicked, for they shall certainly be drowned.""",36,11,وَٱصْنَعِ ٱلْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا وَلَا تُخَٰطِبْنِى فِى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُم مُّغْرَقُونَ,"Allah told Noah to build the Ark, under His observation and protection; and with His inspiration, He taught him how to build it. He told him not to address Him with a request to give time to those who wronged themselves through their disbelief. They would be drowned, inevitably, in the Flood, as a consequence of persisting in their disbelief."
"So he built the ark; and when groups of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him. He said to them: ""Though you laugh at us (now), we shall laugh at you, as you are laughing at us.",37,11,وَيَصْنَعُ ٱلْفُلْكَ وَكُلَّمَا مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ مَلَأٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِۦ سَخِرُوا۟ مِنْهُ قَالَ إِن تَسْخَرُوا۟ مِنَّا فَإِنَّا نَسْخَرُ مِنكُمْ كَمَا تَسْخَرُونَ,"Noah followed the command of his Lord, and immediately started building the Ark. Whenever the leaders and noblemen among his people passed by, they made fun of him, because he was building the Ark and there was no water or rivers around. When they continued to mock him, he said to these important people that if they mocked him and his people today when they were building the Ark, they also mocked them because of their ignorance of the fact that they would be drowned."
"You will soon come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who suffers lasting torment.""",38,11,فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَيَحِلُّ عَلَيْهِ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,"Noah told them that they would come to know who would be punished in this world in a way that disgraced and humiliated them, and upon whom the eternal punishment would come on the Day of Judgement."
"When Our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source, We said: ""Take into (the ark) a pair of every species, and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already, and those who come to believe."" But only a few believed in him.",39,11,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ ٱلتَّنُّورُ قُلْنَا ٱحْمِلْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلَّا مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَوْلُ وَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُۥٓ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ,"Noah (peace be upon him) finished building the Ark that Allah had commanded him to build. Then His command came to destroy them, and the water boiled up from the furnace they used to bake in, signalling the beginning of the Flood. Allah told Noah (peace be upon him) to take on board the Ark a pair of every type of animal on the earth, a male and a female, and to take his family, except for those who it had already been determined would drown because they did not believe. He was told to also take those who believed with him from among his people. Only a small number from his people believed with him, despite the long period of time he had remained among them calling them to have faith in Allah."
"And (Noah) said: ""Embark. In the name of God be its course and mooring. My Lord is surely forgiving and kind.""",40,11,وَقَالَ ٱرْكَبُوا۟ فِيهَا بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ مَجْر۪ىٰهَا وَمُرْسَىٰهَآ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Noah said to those who believed among his family and his people to board the Ark, and that its sailing and landing would be in the name of Allah, saying that his Lord was Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him, and was Compassionate with them. By His mercy to the believers, He saved them from being destroyed."
"It sailed on waves like mountains (high), and Noah called to his son who was separated from him: ""Embark with us, O my son, and be not one of those who do not believe.""",41,11,وَهِىَ تَجْرِى بِهِمْ فِى مَوْجٍ كَٱلْجِبَالِ وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ ٱبْنَهُۥ وَكَانَ فِى مَعْزِلٍ يَٰبُنَىَّ ٱرْكَب مَّعَنَا وَلَا تَكُن مَّعَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The Ark sailed with the people and animals in it, through the great waves like mountains. Noah (peace be upon him) called to his son, who did not believe, and who was isolated from his father and his people in some place. Noah told him to believe, and to get onto the Ark with them so that he would be saved from the Flood; and he told him not to be with the disbelievers, or he would be drowned as they would be."
"""I shall go up a mountain,"" he said, ""which will keep me from the water."" ""There is no getting away,"" said Noah, ""from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy."" And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned.",42,11,قَالَ سَـَٔاوِىٓ إِلَىٰ جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِى مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ قَالَ لَا عَاصِمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ وَحَالَ بَيْنَهُمَا ٱلْمَوْجُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُغْرَقِينَ,"Noah’s son said to him that he would take refuge on a high mountain so that the water could not reach him. Noah told his son that nothing would save anyone from Allah’s punishment of being drowned by the Flood, except those who Allah would save in His mercy. A wave came between Noah and his disbelieving son, and his son was drowned by the Flood because of his disbelief."
"Then it was said: ""O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist."" And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished. The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: ""Away with the cursed people!""",43,11,وَقِيلَ يَٰٓأَرْضُ ٱبْلَعِى مَآءَكِ وَيَٰسَمَآءُ أَقْلِعِى وَغِيضَ ٱلْمَآءُ وَقُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ وَٱسْتَوَتْ عَلَى ٱلْجُودِىِّ وَقِيلَ بُعْدًا لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"After the Flood, Allah told the earth to absorb the water, and He told the sky to hold back and not send down rain; and so the water decreased, until the land became dry. By then, Allah had destroyed the disbelievers. The Ark stopped on Mount Jūdī. It was said, ‘Be gone and destroyed the people of disobedience, for they had overstepped the limits of Allah through their disbelief."
"Noah called on his Lord and said: ""O Lord, my son is surely a member of my family, and verily Your promise is true, as You are the most just of all judges.""",44,11,وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ رَّبَّهُۥ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ٱبْنِى مِنْ أَهْلِى وَإِنَّ وَعْدَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنتَ أَحْكَمُ ٱلْحَٰكِمِينَ,"Noah (peace be upon him)called upon his Lord, saying that his son was of his family, whom He had promised him would be saved. He said that Allah’s promise is always true and that Allah is the most just of judges Who knows best."
"""O Noah"", He answered, ""truly he is not of your family. He is surely the outcome of an unrighteous act. So ask Me not of what you do not know. I warn you not to be one of the ignorant.""",45,11,قَالَ يَٰنُوحُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ إِنَّهُۥ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَٰلِحٍ فَلَا تَسْـَٔلْنِ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ إِنِّىٓ أَعِظُكَ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"Allah said to Noah that his son, who he asked Him to save, was not from his family, whom He had promised to save, because he was a disbeliever. Noah’s question was not appropriate coming from him, and was not right for someone of his rank. Allah told him not to ask Him about what he had no knowledge about, cautioning him not to be among those who are ignorant, by asking Him for things that go against His knowledge and wisdom."
"""Preserve me, O Lord,"" said (Noah), ""from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among those who perish.""",46,11,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّىٓ أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أَسْـَٔلَكَ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ وَإِلَّا تَغْفِرْ لِى وَتَرْحَمْنِىٓ أَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Noah (peace be upon him) asked his Lord to help him by preventing him from asking Him for what he had no knowledge about. He said that if Allah did not forgive him his sin, and have mercy on him, then he would be among the losers who lost their share in the Afterlife."
"(And the Lord) said: ""O Noah, disembark with peace and safety from Us and blessings on you and the people with you. As for some (of them), We shall bestow advantages for a time, then send a grievous punishment on them.""",47,11,قِيلَ يَٰنُوحُ ٱهْبِطْ بِسَلَٰمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَرَكَٰتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰٓ أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُم مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Allah told Noah (peace be upon him) to get down from the Ark on to the ground in safety and security, and with many blessings from Allah upon him and on the believing descendants of those who were with him on the Ark, who would come after them. There would also be other peoples from their descendants who would disbelieve whom Allah would for a time give enjoyment in the life of this world, giving them their livelihood, but then a painful punishment from Him would come to them."
"This is news of the Unknown We reveal to you, which neither you nor your people knew before. So endure with patience. The future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path.",48,11,تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَآ أَنتَ وَلَا قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَٰذَا فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ ٱلْعَٰقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"This story of Noah is from the news of the Ghaib, which the Messenger (peace be upon him)did not know beforehand, and his people did not have knowledge of it either before this revelation from Allah. Allah tells him to be patient in the face of the injury and rejection of his people, just as Noah (peace be upon him) was patient. Help and victory is for those who follow what Allah instructs and who stay away from what He has prohibited."
"We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: ""O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. (As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies.",49,11,وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُودًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا مُفْتَرُونَ,"Allah sent to the people of ‘Ād their brother Hūd (peace be upon him). He told them to worship Allah alone, and not to associate anyone with Him. He told them that they had no real god other than Him, glory be to Him, and that they were not telling the truth in claiming that he had a partner."
"O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me. Will you not, therefore, understand?",50,11,يَٰقَوْمِ لَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلَّذِى فَطَرَنِىٓ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Hūd told his people that he asked for no reward from them for what he conveyed from his Lord, calling them to it, and that his reward was only from Allah Who created him. Would they not think about this, and respond to what he called them to?"
"O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the shies, and give you added strength. So do not turn away from Him as sinners.""",51,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَارًا وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَىٰ قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلَا تَتَوَلَّوْا۟ مُجْرِمِينَ,"Hūd told his people to ask for forgiveness from Allah, and to repent to Him, away from their sins, the biggest of which was associating others with Him. He would reward them by sending abundant rain, and would add strength to their strength by increasing their descendants and wealth. He told them not to turn away from what he was calling them to, because they would then be wrongdoers due to their disbelief in Allah and rejection of what he brought to them."
"They said: ""O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you.",52,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰهُودُ مَا جِئْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِىٓ ءَالِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Hūd’s people said to him that he had not brought them clear proof that would make them believe him. They said that they would not abandon their gods because of his word alone without proof, and that they did not believe him in his claim that he was a messenger."
"All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil."" He replied:"" I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs)",53,11,إِن نَّقُولُ إِلَّا ٱعْتَرَىٰكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوٓءٍ قَالَ إِنِّىٓ أُشْهِدُ ٱللَّهَ وَٱشْهَدُوٓا۟ أَنِّى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,"Hud said, He told them to plot against him together with their gods, which they claimed had afflicted him with madness, and not to give him any respite."
"Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite.",54,11,مِن دُونِهِۦ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ,"Hud said, He told them to plot against him together with their gods, which they claimed had afflicted him with madness, and not to give him any respite."
I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him. Verily the way of my Lord is straight.,55,11,إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُم مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ ءَاخِذٌۢ بِنَاصِيَتِهَآ إِنَّ رَبِّى عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Hūd told them that he put his trust in Allah and relied upon Him alone in everything, because He was his Lord and their Lord. He told them that there is nothing walking on the face of the earth except that it is under His power and control, and He deals with it as He wills. He also told them that His Lord was true and just, and so would not give them power over him, since he stood for the truth and they stood for falsehood."
"If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him. Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things.""",56,11,فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُم مَّآ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِۦٓ إِلَيْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفُ رَبِّى قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ وَلَا تَضُرُّونَهُۥ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ رَبِّى عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَفِيظٌ,"He told them that if they continued to turn away from what he brought them, then he had no responsibility to do more than convey the message to them. He had delivered to them everything that Allah had sent him with and instructed him to convey. The proof would be against them, and his Lord would destroy them and bring another people to succeed them. They would not do Allah the slightest harm through their rejecting and turning away, because He has no need of His creation. He told them that his Lord watches over all things, and that it was He Who protected him from the evil they plotted against him."
"So, when Our command was issued We rescued Hud by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, and saved them from a dreadful doom.",57,11,وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا هُودًا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,"When Allah’s command came to destroy them, He saved Hūd and those who believed with him by a mercy from Him, and He saved them from a stern punishment given to the disbelievers of his people."
"These were the people of 'Ad who denied the word of their Lord and rebelled against His apostles, and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant.",58,11,وَتِلْكَ عَادٌ جَحَدُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَصَوْا۟ رُسُلَهُۥ وَٱتَّبَعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَ كُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ,"Such were the people of ‘Ād. They disbelieved in the signs of Allah, their Lord, and went against His messenger Hūd. They followed the instruction of every tyrant who was proud against the truth, not accepting it or dedicating themselves to it."
"So they were accursed in the world, and they will be damned on the Day of Doom. Beware! The 'Ad turned away from their Lord.",59,11,وَأُتْبِعُوا۟ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَلَآ إِنَّ عَادًا كَفَرُوا۟ رَبَّهُمْ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِّعَادٍ قَوْمِ هُودٍ,"They were then cursed with contempt and removed from Allah’s mercy in this world, and on the Day of Judgement they will also be without Allah’s mercy. Due to their disbelief in Allah, the Exalted, He distances them from every good and allows them to approach every evil."
"Be warned! Accursed are the people of 'Ad who were Hud's. To Thamud We Sent their brother Saleh. ""O my people,"" he said, ""worship God; you have no other god but He. It is He who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it. So beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is near and answers.""",60,11,وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَٰلِحًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥ هُوَ أَنشَأَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا فَٱسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ رَبِّى قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ,"Allah sent to the people of Thamūd their brother Ṣāliḥ. He told his people to worship Allah alone, and that they had no god worthy of worship other than Him. He created them from the clay of the earth when He created their father Adam from it, and made them settle in it. He told them to ask for forgiveness from Him, and that his Lord was Near to those who devoted themselves to worshipping Him, responding to their prayers."
"They said: ""O Saleh, we had placed our hopes in you, but you forbid us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped, and we are suspicious of what you are calling us to.""",61,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰصَٰلِحُ قَدْ كُنتَ فِينَا مَرْجُوًّا قَبْلَ هَٰذَآ أَتَنْهَىٰنَآ أَن نَّعْبُدَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُنَا وَإِنَّنَا لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَآ إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ,"Ṣāliḥ’s people said to him that he had had a high position among them before this, and they had hoped he would be wise, advising them and counselling them. Did he tell them not to worship what their fathers had worshipped? They said that they doubted what he called them to – which was worshipping Allah alone – making them suspect him of making things up about Allah."
"He said: ""O my people, have you considered that if my Lord has clearly shown me the way, and I have His blessings too, who will save me then from God if I disobey? You will only add to my ruin.",62,11,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى وَءَاتَىٰنِى مِنْهُ رَحْمَةً فَمَن يَنصُرُنِى مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ عَصَيْتُهُۥ فَمَا تَزِيدُونَنِى غَيْرَ تَخْسِيرٍ,"In reply, Ṣāliḥ asked his people to tell him that, if he had clear proof from his Lord, and He had given him mercy, which was his prophethood, then who would protect him from His punishment if he went against Him by not delivering what He instructed him to deliver to them? They would, then, only increase him in error, distancing him from Allah’s pleasure."
"O my people, this she-camel of God is a token for you. So leave her alone to graze on God's earth, and do not molest her, otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you.""",63,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ هَٰذِهِۦ نَاقَةُ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ ءَايَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِىٓ أَرْضِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوٓءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ قَرِيبٌ,"Ṣāliḥ told his people about a particular camel of Allah’s which was a clear miracle for them, and a sign of the truth of what he said. He told them to leave her to graze in Allah’s land and not to harm her in any way or a punishment would come to them near to the time that they harmed her."
"But they hamstrung her. Then (Saleh) said: ""You have but three days to enjoy life in your homes. Infallible is this promise.",64,11,فَعَقَرُوهَا فَقَالَ تَمَتَّعُوا۟ فِى دَارِكُمْ ثَلَٰثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذَٰلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ,"They denied what he said and harmed her, pushing their denial to extremes. So Ṣāliḥ told them to enjoy life in their land for three days from the time they harmed her, then the punishment of Allah would come to them; and the coming of His punishment after that was a certain promise that there would be no possibility of denying, as it would come true."
"So, when Our command (of punishment) came We delivered Saleh by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, from the disgrace of that day. Verily your Lord is mighty and powerful.",65,11,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا صَٰلِحًا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَمِنْ خِزْىِ يَوْمِئِذٍ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلْقَوِىُّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ,"When Allah’s command came to destroy them, He saved Ṣāliḥ and those who had faith with him, by a mercy from Him, and He saved them from the disgrace and humiliation of that day. Without doubt, your Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty Who no one can overcome; and therefore He destroyed the disbelieving peoples."
"The sinners were seized by a blast from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning,",66,11,وَأَخَذَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ فِى دِيَٰرِهِمْ جَٰثِمِينَ,"The great scream overtook the people of Thamūd, so that they perished from the strength of it; and in the morning, they lay face down upon the ground."
As though they had never lived there at all. Beware! The people of Thamud turned away from their Lord. Beware! Accursed are the people of Thamud.,67,11,كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْا۟ فِيهَآ أَلَآ إِنَّ ثَمُودَا۟ كَفَرُوا۟ رَبَّهُمْ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِّثَمُودَ,"It was as if they had never lived in their land in comfort and ease. Certainly, Thamūd disbelieved in Allah, their Lord, and so they remain outcasts from His mercy."
"Our angels came to Abraham with good news, and said: ""Peace on you. ""Peace on you too,"" said Abraham, and hastened to bring a roasted calf.",68,11,وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ بِٱلْبُشْرَىٰ قَالُوا۟ سَلَٰمًا قَالَ سَلَٰمٌ فَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ,"Then the angels came to Abraham (peace and blessing be upon him) in the form of men, giving good news to him and his wife of Isaac and Jacob. The angels said ‘Peace’, so he replied by saying ‘Peace’. Then he went quickly and brought them a roasted calf to eat, thinking that they were men."
"When they did not stretch their hands towards it he became suspicious and afraid of them. They said: ""Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot.""",69,11,فَلَمَّا رَءَآ أَيْدِيَهُمْ لَا تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً قَالُوا۟ لَا تَخَفْ إِنَّآ أُرْسِلْنَآ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ,"But when Abraham saw that their hands did not reach out for the calf and that they were not eating it, he was confused by them, and felt fear of them. When the angels saw his fear of them, they told him not to be afraid, and that they had been sent by Allah to the people of Lot to give them their punishment."
"His wife who stood near, laughed as We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of Jacob.",70,11,وَٱمْرَأَتُهُۥ قَآئِمَةٌ فَضَحِكَتْ فَبَشَّرْنَٰهَا بِإِسْحَٰقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَٰقَ يَعْقُوبَ,"Abraham’s wife, Sarah, was standing. Then they told her something that greatly pleased her, that she would bear Isaac, and that Isaac would have Jacob. She laughed and was delighted by what she heard."
"She said: ""Woe betide me! Will I give birth when I am old and this my husband be aged? This is indeed surprising!""",71,11,قَالَتْ يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰٓ ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَا۠ عَجُوزٌ وَهَٰذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ,"When the angels gave Sarah this amazing good news, she asked how she could have a child when she was an old woman and her husband was also advanced in age. Having a child at such an age was incredible, and was not normal."
"""Why are you surprised at the command of God? God's mercy and blessings be upon you, O members of this household,"" they said. ""Verily He is worthy of praise and glory.""",72,11,قَالُوٓا۟ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ ٱللَّهِ وَبَرَكَٰتُهُۥ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ ٱلْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُۥ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ,"When Sarah was amazed at the news, the angels asked her if she was amazed by Allah’s decree and command, because people like her know that Allah is able to do such things. ‘The mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of Abraham!’ they said. Allah is praised in His attributes and actions, the Possessor of Glory and the Honourable."
"When Abraham's fear was dispelled, and the good news had come to him, he pleaded for the people of Lot with Us.",73,11,فَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ٱلرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ يُجَٰدِلُنَا فِى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ,"After the departure of the fear that Abraham (peace be upon him) had felt because of his guests not eating his food, the discovery that the guests were angels, and receiving the joyous news that he would have Isaac, who would have Jacob, he then started to debate with the messengers about the people of Lot, asking that the punishment for them be delayed, and that Lot and his family be saved."
"Abraham was kind, compassionate, and penitent.",74,11,إِنَّ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّٰهٌ مُّنِيبٌ,"Abraham was forbearing, wanting to delay the punishment, praying often to his Lord, calling upon Him, and turning to Him."
"""Desist from pleading, O Abraham,"" (they said). ""Your Lord's command has verily been issued, and a punishment that cannot be averted is bound to fall on them.""",75,11,يَٰٓإِبْرَٰهِيمُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَٰذَآ إِنَّهُۥ قَدْ جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ وَإِنَّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِمْ عَذَابٌ غَيْرُ مَرْدُودٍ,"The angels told Abraham to leave off debating about the people of Lot: the command of his Lord had come that they would receive the punishment He had decreed for them, and there was a great punishment coming to the people of Lot, which no debate or prayer could turn back."
"So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: ""This is a day of sorrow.",76,11,وَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا سِىٓءَ بِهِمْ وَضَاقَ بِهِمْ ذَرْعًا وَقَالَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَصِيبٌ,"When the angels came to Lot in the form of men he was distressed by their coming to him, and he was upset because he feared for them due to the fact that his people went to men with desire instead of women. Lot said that it was a terrible day because he thought his people would force themselves on his guests."
"His people came excited to him. They were addicted to sin already. Said (Lot): ""O my people, these daughters of mine are cleaner (and lawful) for you. Have fear of God, and do not shame me before my guests. Is there no man of discernment among you?""",77,11,وَجَآءَهُۥ قَوْمُهُۥ يُهْرَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ وَمِن قَبْلُ كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ بَنَاتِى هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَلَا تُخْزُونِ فِى ضَيْفِىٓ أَلَيْسَ مِنكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ,"The people of Lot came rushing to him, intending to commit an outrage against his guests. They were used to going to men with desire instead of women. In order to put his people off his guests, Lot told them that they should marry the women among his people, because they were purer for them than the outrage they committed. He told them to fear Allah and not to disgrace him concerning his guests, asking if there was a single right-minded man among them who would tell them not to commit such a shameful act."
"They said: ""You know we have no need for your daughters, and know well what we want.""",78,11,قَالُوا۟ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِى بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ,"His people said to him that he knew that they had no need of the women among his people, and no desire, and he knew very well what they wanted, as they only desired men."
"""I wish I had the power to resist you,"" said (Lot), ""or powerful support.""",79,11,قَالَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِى بِكُمْ قُوَّةً أَوْ ءَاوِىٓ إِلَىٰ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ,"Lot said that if only he had strength to use against them or people to support him, then he would be able to come between them and his guests."
"(The angels) said: ""O Lot, we have verily been sent by your Lord. They will never be able to harm you. So, leave late at night with your family, and none of you should turn back to look; but your wife will suffer (the fate) they are going to suffer. Their hour of doom is in the morning: Is not the morning nigh?""",80,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰلُوطُ إِنَّا رُسُلُ رَبِّكَ لَن يَصِلُوٓا۟ إِلَيْكَ فَأَسْرِ بِأَهْلِكَ بِقِطْعٍ مِّنَ ٱلَّيْلِ وَلَا يَلْتَفِتْ مِنكُمْ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا ٱمْرَأَتَكَ إِنَّهُۥ مُصِيبُهَا مَآ أَصَابَهُمْ إِنَّ مَوْعِدَهُمُ ٱلصُّبْحُ أَلَيْسَ ٱلصُّبْحُ بِقَرِيبٍ,"The angels said to Lot (peace be upon him) that they were messengers sent by Allah, and that his people would not be able to touch him with their evil. They told him to leave the town at night, when it was dark, with his family. They said that no one should turn to look at what was behind them, except for his wife, who would turn back wrongly, because the punishment that would come upon his people would also come upon her. They told Lot that the appointed time for their destruction would be the morning, and that it was nearly time."
"So when the decreed moment arrived, We turned the habitations upside down, and rained upon them stones of hardened lava in quick succession,",81,11,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَٰلِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ مَّنضُودٍ,"When My command to destroy the people of Lot came, I turned their towns upside down by raising and overturning them together with the people; and I rained down on them stones of hard-layered baked clay that came down one after the other."
Impressed with (the signs) of your Lord. And such (punishment) is not far for the (other) transgressers.,82,11,مُّسَوَّمَةً عِندَ رَبِّكَ وَمَا هِىَ مِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ,"These stones were marked by Allah with a special sign, and they are not far away from the wrongdoers of the Quraysh and others. Instead, it is near and will come down on them when Allah decrees it to come down."
"We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib. He said: ""O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. So do not give in short measure nor underweigh. I see you are prosperous, but I fear the doom of an overwhelming Day for you.",83,11,وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥ وَلَا تَنقُصُوا۟ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰكُم بِخَيْرٍ وَإِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُّحِيطٍ,"We sent to Madyan their brother, Shu’ayb, who said: O my people, worship Allah alone. You have no other god that deserves to be worshipped besides Him. Do not give people less in the measure of volume and weight when you deal with them. I see you in prosperity and with blessings, so do not change Allah’s favour to you by committing sins. I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing day that will reach every one of you and from which you will not find any place to run to or seek refuge in."
"So, O my people, weigh and measure with justness, and do not withhold things due to men, and do not spread corruption in the land, despoiling it.",84,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ أَوْفُوا۟ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا۟ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"He said: O my people, give complete and just measure of volume and weight when you measure for others. Do not cheat people of their rights by giving short measure and deceiving them. Do not spread corruption on earth by killing and committing other sins."
"That which is left to you by God is better, if you are true believers; yet I am not a warden over you.""",85,11,بَقِيَّتُ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ عَلَيْكُم بِحَفِيظٍ,"He further said: The lawful that Allah leaves for you after giving people their rights in full and with fairness is of more benefit and contains more blessing than the extra obtained through giving short measure and spreading corruption on earth. If you are indeed believers, then be content with that remainder. It is not my duty to watch over you, record your actions and hold you to account for them. The One Who watches over you is the One Who knows all secrets and private conversations."
"They said: ""O Shu'aib, does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped, or desist from doing what we like with our goods? How gracious a man of discernment you are indeed!""",86,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰشُعَيْبُ أَصَلَوٰتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِىٓ أَمْوَٰلِنَا مَا نَشَٰٓؤُا۟ إِنَّكَ لَأَنتَ ٱلْحَلِيمُ ٱلرَّشِيدُ,"The people of Shu’ayb said to him: O Shu’ayb, does the prayer that you offer instruct you that we should leave the worship of the idols our fathers used to worship? Does it instruct you that we should leave dealing in our wealth as we wish, and investing it as we wish? You are indeed the sensible and wise person we knew you to be before this invitation. What has happened to you?"
"He said: ""O my people, think. I have a clear sign from my Lord, who has also given me a goodly provision, and I do not wish for myself what I forbid you: I only wish to reform you as best I can. My success is from God alone. In Him I have placed my trust, and to Him I turn.",87,11,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى وَرَزَقَنِى مِنْهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنْهَىٰكُمْ عَنْهُ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلَّا ٱلْإِصْلَٰحَ مَا ٱسْتَطَعْتُ وَمَا تَوْفِيقِىٓ إِلَّا بِٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ,"Shu’ayb said to his people: O my people, tell me what will be your position if I am on clear proof and insight from my Lord, and He has given me lawful provision from Him, as well as prophethood? I do not wish to prohibit you from something and go against you and do it myself. I only wish to set your matter right, to the best of my ability, by inviting you to declare the Oneness of your Lord and to obey Him. My success in achieving this is only with Allah, may He be glorified! I place my trust in Him alone and I turn to Him in all my affairs."
"""O my people (I fear) lest your opposition to me should bring you the like of what befell the people of Noah or Hud or Saleh; and the people of Lot are not distant from you.",88,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ لَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِىٓ أَن يُصِيبَكُم مِّثْلُ مَآ أَصَابَ قَوْمَ نُوحٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ هُودٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ صَٰلِحٍ وَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ,"He continued: O my people, do not let your hatred for me make you deny what I have brought. You should fear that you will suffer like the people of Noah, the people of Hūd or the people of Ṣāliḥ. The people of Lot are not far from you, in time nor place. You know what happened to them, so take a lesson from that."
"""Beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him. Indeed my Lord is compassionate and loving.""",89,11,وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ رَبِّى رَحِيمٌ وَدُودٌ,Seek forgiveness from your Lord. Then repent to Him from your sins. My Lord is Compassionate to those who repent and is Most Loving to those who turn to Him.
"They said: ""O Shu'aib, much of what you say is meaningless to us, and then (for sure) you are powerless among us. But for your clan we would have stoned you to death. You have no power over us.",90,11,قَالُوا۟ يَٰشُعَيْبُ مَا نَفْقَهُ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا تَقُولُ وَإِنَّا لَنَرَىٰكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفًا وَلَوْلَا رَهْطُكَ لَرَجَمْنَٰكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْنَا بِعَزِيزٍ,"The people of Shu’ayb said to him: O Shu’ayb, we do not understand much of what you have brought. We regard you to be weak amongst us, and you are not one of the senior leaders. If it were not that your family follows our religious beliefs, we would have killed you by stoning. To us, you are not a person of honour such that we would be afraid of killing you. The only reason we did not kill you is out of respect for your family."
"He said: ""My clan seems mightier to you than God whom you neglect and push behind your backs. Surely what you do is within the power of my Lord.",91,11,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَرَهْطِىٓ أَعَزُّ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱتَّخَذْتُمُوهُ وَرَآءَكُمْ ظِهْرِيًّا إِنَّ رَبِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,"Shu’ayb said to his people: O my people, is my family more respectable and honoured to you than Allah, your Lord? Did you throw Allah behind you when you did not accept the prophet He sent to you? My Lord surrounds what you do. No action of yours is hidden from Him. He will repay your behaviour in the world with destruction, and in the Afterlife with punishment."
"Do on your part what you can, O people, I will do what I will. You will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who is the liar. So watch; I am watching with you.""",92,11,وَيَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّى عَٰمِلٌ سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ كَٰذِبٌ وَٱرْتَقِبُوٓا۟ إِنِّى مَعَكُمْ رَقِيبٌ,"O my people, do what you are able to in the manner you wish. I will also act in the manner I wish, as far as I can. Soon, you will come to know which of us is to receive a punishment of humiliation as justice, and who is lying in their claim. So wait for Allah’s decision and I will also wait with you."
"And when Our word came to pass, We rescued Shu'aib and those who believed, with him, by Our grace, but those who were wicked were seized by a punishment from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning.",93,11,وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ فِى دِيَٰرِهِمْ جَٰثِمِينَ,"When My command to destroy the people of Shu’ayb came, I rescued Shu’ayb and the people of faith with him through mercy from Me. Those of his people who did wrong were afflicted with the intense blast and they died. In the morning, they were found lying on the ground with their faces in the dust."
As though they had not dwelt there at all. Beware! Condemmed were the people of Midian as those of Thamud had been before them!,94,11,كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْا۟ فِيهَآ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِّمَدْيَنَ كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ,"It was as if they had never resided there previously. Without doubt, Madyan was distanced from Allah’s mercy when His punishment fell on them, just as Thamūd was driven away from it by Allah’s sending down His anger on them."
We sent Moses with Our signs and full authority,95,11,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,I had sent Moses with My signs that indicated My Oneness and with clear evidence that proved the truth of what he brought.
"To the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they followed the bidding of Pharaoh, though the bidding of Pharaoh was unrightful.",96,11,إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦ فَٱتَّبَعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَآ أَمْرُ فِرْعَوْنَ بِرَشِيدٍ,I sent Moses to Pharaoh and the nobles from his people. These nobles followed Pharaoh’s command to them to disbelieve in Allah. The command of Pharaoh was not one that was right to be followed.
"He shall be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and drive them into Hell like cattle driven to water -- what an evil watering-place to reach!",97,11,يَقْدُمُ قَوْمَهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْوِرْدُ ٱلْمَوْرُودُ,Pharaoh will go ahead of his people on the Day of Judgement until he enters them and himself into the fire of Hell. What a wretched place he will lead them to!
"Damned will they be in this world, and on the Day of Doom how evil the gift that they will receive!",98,11,وَأُتْبِعُوا۟ فِى هَٰذِهِۦ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ بِئْسَ ٱلرِّفْدُ ٱلْمَرْفُودُ,"Together with the destruction and drowning that afflicted them, Allah followed that with a curse and with their being driven away and distanced from His mercy in this world and on the Day of Judgement. What an evil thing happened to them in that they became the subject of two curses and punishment in the world and the Afterlife!"
"These are a few accounts of settlements that We narrate to you. Some still survive, and some have been mowed down.",99,11,ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّهُۥ عَلَيْكَ مِنْهَا قَآئِمٌ وَحَصِيدٌ,"I inform you, O Messenger, of the incidents of the towns that have been mentioned in this sūrah. The landmarks of some of these towns still exist and the landmarks of others have been wiped out without any trace."
"We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. When your Lord's chastisement descended upon them, their gods, on whom they called apart from God, were not of the least avail, and all they did was only to add to their destruction.",100,11,وَمَا ظَلَمْنَٰهُمْ وَلَٰكِن ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَمَآ أَغْنَتْ عَنْهُمْ ءَالِهَتُهُمُ ٱلَّتِى يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ لَّمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ وَمَا زَادُوهُمْ غَيْرَ تَتْبِيبٍ,"I did not wrong them by afflicting them with destruction, but they wronged their own souls by bringing them to the point of destruction when they disbelieved in Allah. The gods they used to worship besides Allah did not push back the punishment that came down on them when the command of your Lord, O Messenger, came for their destruction. These gods of theirs only increased them in loss and destruction."
Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness. Surely His hold is grievous and terrible.,101,11,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَآ أَخَذَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَهِىَ ظَٰلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُۥٓ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ,"Such is the grip and annihilation with which Allah seizes the towns that deny, in every time and place. His grip of such disobedient towns is a painful and strong one."
"In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident.",102,11,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّمَنْ خَافَ عَذَابَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّجْمُوعٌ لَّهُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّشْهُودٌ,"In Allah’s severe punishment of those disobedient towns there is a lesson and warning for the one who fears the punishment of the Day of Judgement. Allah will gather people on that day to take them to account, and it will be witnessed by all people on the plains of the resurrection."
We are deferring it only for a time ordained.,103,11,وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُۥٓ إِلَّا لِأَجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ,I only postpone that witnessed day for a time that is known.
"The day it comes no soul will dare say a word but by His leave; and some will be wretched, some will be blessed.",104,11,يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِىٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ,"When that day comes no soul will be able to present any argument or make any intercession, except after He gives permission. People on that day will be of two types: a miserable person who will enter the fire of Hell and a delighted person who will enter Paradise."
"And those who are doomed, will be in Hell: For them will be sighing and sobbing,",105,11,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ شَقُوا۟ فَفِى ٱلنَّارِ لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ,"Those who are wretched, because of their disbelief and corrupt actions, will enter the fire of Hell, in which their voices and their breath will be raised due to the severity of the blazing fire that they will suffer from."
"Where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure, unless your Lord will otherwise. Verily your Lord does as He wills.",106,11,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَآءَ رَبُّكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ فَعَّالٌ لِّمَا يُرِيدُ,"They will live in it eternally and will not come out of it for as long as the heavens and the earth last, except for those sinful monotheists whom Allah wills to remove from it. Your Lord, O Messenger, is the One Who does whatever He wishes and nothing can force Him to do something."
"Those who are blessed will be in Paradise, where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive, unless your Lord wills otherwise: This will be a gift uninterrupted.",107,11,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ سُعِدُوا۟ فَفِى ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَآءَ رَبُّكَ عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ,"Those who were made fortunate by Allah because of their faith and good actions will be in Paradise. They will live there eternally for as long as the heavens and the earth last, except for those sinful monotheists whom Allah wills to enter into the fire of Hell for a time. The delight that Allah will provide for the people of Paradise will never be cut off from them."
"So, you should not entertain any doubt about those whom they worship: They only worship what their fathers had worshipped before them. We shall verily give them their meed without diminution.",108,11,فَلَا تَكُ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّمَّا يَعْبُدُ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُهُم مِّن قَبْلُ وَإِنَّا لَمُوَفُّوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ غَيْرَ مَنقُوصٍ,"So do not be, O Messenger, in doubt about the invalidity of what these idolaters worship. They have no proof based on logic or any proof from the sacred law to justify such worship. The only thing that makes them worship other than Allah is their blind following of their forefathers. He will give them their full portion of the punishment without any reduction."
"Verily We gave to Moses the Book, but there was disagreement about it. Had the decree of your Lord (delaying it) not been issued the matter would have been settled between them. They are still suspicious of it and in doubt.",109,11,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ فَٱخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,"I had given Moses the Torah, but people differed with respect to it: some of them believed, while others did not. Had it not been for Allah’s prior decree that the punishment will not come quickly, but will be postponed until the Day of Judgement for a reason, the punishment they deserve would have come down on them in this world. The disbelieving Jews and idolaters are in doubt about the Qur’ān, which creates uncertainty in them."
Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds. He is certainly aware of all they do.,110,11,وَإِنَّ كُلًّا لَّمَّا لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ رَبُّكَ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, will certainly give each group who disagreed a full repayment for their actions. Any good action will receive a good repayment and any evil action will receive an evil repayment. Allah is Aware of what they do. No action of theirs is hidden from Him."
"So, you and those who turned to God with you, should walk along the straight path as you have been commanded, and do not transgress, for He verily sees whatsoever you do.",111,11,فَٱسْتَقِمْ كَمَآ أُمِرْتَ وَمَن تَابَ مَعَكَ وَلَا تَطْغَوْا۟ إِنَّهُۥ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"So remain patient, O Messenger, as Allah has instructed you. Fulfil His instructions and stay away from His prohibitions. Let those believers who have repented with you also remain patient. Do not overstep the limits by committing sins, because He sees what you do. No action of yours is hidden from Him and He will repay you for what you do."
"Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help.",112,11,وَلَا تَرْكَنُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ فَتَمَسَّكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ,"Do not incline to the disbelievers who do wrong by being kind to them or showing them love, or the fire of Hell will afflict you because of such inclination; and you will not have any friends besides Allah to save you from it. Then you will not find anyone to help you."
Stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and the first watch of night. Remember that good deeds nullify the bad. This is a reminder for those who are observant.,113,11,وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ طَرَفَىِ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَزُلَفًا مِّنَ ٱلَّيْلِ إِنَّ ٱلْحَسَنَٰتِ يُذْهِبْنَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ ذَٰلِكَ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلذَّٰكِرِينَ,"Maintain, O Messenger, the prayer in the best manner at the two ends of the day: at the beginning and end of the day. Also, maintain the prayer during the hours of the night. Good actions wipe out minor sins. This is a warning for those who pay attention and a lesson for those who accept."
"Be steadfast, for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste.",114,11,وَٱصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Be patient in doing what you have been instructed to do with respect to being upright and avoiding the things you have been prohibited from, such as transgression and leaning towards the wrongdoers. Allah will not cause the reward of those who do good to be wasted. Instead, He will accept from them the best of what they did and will give them their reward in accordance with their best actions."
"If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them. Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners.",115,11,فَلَوْلَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ أُو۟لُوا۟ بَقِيَّةٍ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْفَسَادِ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّمَّنْ أَنجَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ وَٱتَّبَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مَآ أُتْرِفُوا۟ فِيهِ وَكَانُوا۟ مُجْرِمِينَ,"If only there were, among the communities who were punished before you, remnants of the people of virtue and piety who prohibited those communities from disbelief and from corruption on earth through sins. But there were no such remnants among them, except for a few of them who used to prohibit corruption and whom I saved when I destroyed their people who did wrong. The wrongdoers from their people pursued the luxuries they had and were wrong in doing so."
Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous.,116,11,وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ لِيُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا مُصْلِحُونَ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, would not destroy any town if its inhabitants were acting correctly on earth. He would only destroy it if the inhabitants were causing corruption by disbelief, disobedience and sins."
"But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief. But they would still have differed from one another,",117,11,وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ,"If your Lord, O Messenger, willed to make people one nation on the truth, He would have done so; but He did not will that, so they continue to differ with respect to it because of their following their desires and doing wrong."
"Except those on whom your Lord had mercy for which He has created them. But fulfilled shall be the word of your Lord. ""I will fill up Hell with jinns and men.""",118,11,إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذَٰلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"This is so except for those whom Allah showed mercy by giving them guidance. They do not differ with respect to His Oneness, may He be glorified. For this test of disagreement, He created them. Some of them are wretched and others fortunate. The word of your Lord, O Messenger, in which He decreed in pre-eternity to fill Hell with jinn and humans who follow Satan, is final."
"The histories of apostles that We relate to you are (meant) to strengthen your heart. Through them has the truth come to you, and guidance, and reminder to those who believe.",119,11,وَكُلًّا نَّقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلرُّسُلِ مَا نُثَبِّتُ بِهِۦ فُؤَادَكَ وَجَآءَكَ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَوْعِظَةٌ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Every incident I relate to you, O Messenger, from the lives of the messengers before you is to make your heart firm on the truth and to strengthen it. In this sūrah, the truth, about which there is no doubt, has come to you. In it there has come to you a warning for the disbelievers and a reminder for the believers (who benefit from such a reminder)."
"Say to the infidels. ""Act as best you can, we are acting too;",120,11,وَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّا عَٰمِلُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to those who do not have faith in Allah and do not accept His Oneness: Act according to your way of ignoring the truth and preventing others from it. We will also act according to our way of remaining firm on it, inviting towards it and being patient in it."
"And wait (for what is to come), we are also waiting (to see).""",121,11,وَٱنتَظِرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ,Wait to see what comes down on us. I am also waiting to see what comes down on you.
"To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him. So worship Him and put your trust in Him; your Lord is not heedless of what you do.",122,11,وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ ٱلْأَمْرُ كُلُّهُۥ فَٱعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah alone has knowledge of the Ghaib in the heavens and the earth. Nothing is hidden from Him. The entire matter will be returned to Him alone on the Day of Judgement. So worship Him alone, O Messenger, and place your trust in Him in all your affairs. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do. Instead, He knows about it and He will repay each person for what they did."
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the immaculate Book.,0,12,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓر تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Alif Lām Rā’ – the placement of such letters has been discussed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah. The verses that are revealed in this sūrah are from the verses of the Qur’ān which are clear in their meaning.
We have sent it down as a clear discourse that you may understand.,1,12,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ قُرْءَٰنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"I have revealed the Qur’ān in the language of the Arabs, so that you, O Arabs, can understand its meanings."
Through the revelation of this Qur'an We narrate the best of histories of which you were unaware before.,2,12,نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْقَصَصِ بِمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ وَإِن كُنتَ مِن قَبْلِهِۦ لَمِنَ ٱلْغَٰفِلِينَ,"By revealing this Qur’ān to you, I narrate, O Messenger, the best of stories, in their accuracy, the soundness of their words and their eloquence. Before I revealed it, you were unaware of these stories, without any knowledge of them."
"When Joseph told his father: ""O my father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage,""",3,12,إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لِأَبِيهِ يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّى رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًا وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِى سَٰجِدِينَ,"I tell you, O Messenger, about the time when Joseph said to his father, Jacob, ‘O my father, I dreamt of eleven stars and I saw the sun and the moon. I saw all of them prostrating to me’. This dream was an early sign of good news for Joseph (peace be upon him)."
"He said: ""O son, do not narrate your dream to your brothers, or they will plot against you. Surely Satan is man's acknowledged foe.",4,12,قَالَ يَٰبُنَىَّ لَا تَقْصُصْ رُءْيَاكَ عَلَىٰٓ إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُوا۟ لَكَ كَيْدًا إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"Jacob said to his son, Joseph: O my son, do not mention your dream to your brothers because they will understand it and become jealous of you. They will then plot against you because of their envy. Satan is a clear enemy to man’."
"Your Lord will choose you and teach you to interpret events, and confer His favours on you and the house of Jacob, as He had done in the case of two ancestors of yours, Abraham and Isaac, before you. Indeed your Lord is all-knowing and all-wise.""",5,12,وَكَذَٰلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلْأَحَادِيثِ وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰٓ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ كَمَآ أَتَمَّهَا عَلَىٰٓ أَبَوَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Just as you have seen that dream, your Lord will choose you, O Joseph, and teach you the interpretation of dreams; and He will perfect His favour on you by giving you prophethood, as well as kingdom, just as He completed His blessing on your two forefathers before you, Abraham and Isaac, with the favours of this world and the Afterlife that He blessed them with. Your Lord is One Who knows His creation and Who is Wise in His planning."
In the story of Joseph and his brothers are lessons for those who inquire.,6,12,لَّقَدْ كَانَ فِى يُوسُفَ وَإِخْوَتِهِۦٓ ءَايَٰتٌ لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ,In the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons and advices for those who ask about the incident.
"""Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we,"" (said his half brothers) ""even though we are a well-knit band. Our father is surely in the wrong.",7,12,إِذْ قَالُوا۟ لَيُوسُفُ وَأَخُوهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىٰٓ أَبِينَا مِنَّا وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّ أَبَانَا لَفِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"At that time, the brothers said among themselves: Joseph and his full brother are more beloved to our father than we are, whereas we are a group large in number. Why does he prefer them to us? We think that our father is mistaken in preferring them to us without any apparent reason."
"Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father's exclusive affection; then play innocent.""",8,12,ٱقْتُلُوا۟ يُوسُفَ أَوِ ٱطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضًا يَخْلُ لَكُمْ وَجْهُ أَبِيكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ قَوْمًا صَٰلِحِينَ,"It was further said: Kill Joseph or expel him to a far-off land and your father’s attention will be all yours and he will love you completely. After killing him and expelling him, you can be righteous when you repent from your sin."
"One of them said: ""If you must do so, then do not kill Joseph, but throw him into an unused well. Some passing caravan may rescue him.""",9,12,قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ لَا تَقْتُلُوا۟ يُوسُفَ وَأَلْقُوهُ فِى غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ ٱلسَّيَّارَةِ إِن كُنتُمْ فَٰعِلِينَ,"One of the brothers said: Do not kill Yousuf, rather throw him into a well and some passers by may find him and take him, this is a lesser evil if you really want to get rid of him."
"(Then going to their father) they said: ""O father, why don't you trust us with Joseph? We are in fact his well-wishers.",10,12,قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَا مَا لَكَ لَا تَأْمَ۫نَّا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَنَٰصِحُونَ,"When they agreed to get rid of him, they said to their father, Jacob: O our father, why do not you trust us with Joseph? We have compassion for him and we will take care of him against anything that might harm him. We want good for him, so we will protect and look after him until he comes back to you safely. So, what stops you from sending him with us?"
"Let him go out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy and play. We shall take care of him.""",11,12,أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَدًا يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَحَٰفِظُونَ,"Let us take him with us tomorrow, so he can have a good time and play with us and we will protect him from any harm that may come to him."
"He said: ""I am afraid of sending him with you lest a wolf should devour him when you are unmindful.""",12,12,قَالَ إِنِّى لَيَحْزُنُنِىٓ أَن تَذْهَبُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَأَخَافُ أَن يَأْكُلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَأَنتُمْ عَنْهُ غَٰفِلُونَ,"Jacob said to his sons: I am saddened by your taking him because I cannot bear to be away from him. I also fear that a wolf may eat him when you are not paying attention to him, absorbed in your enjoyment and play."
"They replied: ""If a wolf should devour him when we are there, a well-knit band, we shall certainly be treacherous.""",13,12,قَالُوا۟ لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّخَٰسِرُونَ,"They said to their father: If a wolf was to eat Joseph when there are so many of us, then, in such a case, we are good for nothing and we are losers because we could not save him from the wolf."
"So, when they took him out they planned to throw him into an unused well. We revealed to Joseph: ""You will tell them (one day) of this deed when they will not apprehend it.""",14,12,فَلَمَّا ذَهَبُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَأَجْمَعُوٓا۟ أَن يَجْعَلُوهُ فِى غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ لَتُنَبِّئَنَّهُم بِأَمْرِهِمْ هَٰذَا وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"So Jacob sent Joseph with his brothers. They took him a long distance and were determined to throw him to the bottom of a well. In this condition, I sent revelation to Joseph saying, ‘You will inform them of this act of theirs at a time when they will not realise that it is you’."
"At nightfall they came to their father weeping,",15,12,وَجَآءُوٓ أَبَاهُمْ عِشَآءً يَبْكُونَ,"The brothers of Joseph came to their father in the evening, pretending to cry in order for him to believe them."
"And said: ""We went racing with one another and left Joseph to guard our things when a wolf devoured him. But you will not believe us even though we tell the truth.""",16,12,قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَآ إِنَّا ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ وَتَرَكْنَا يُوسُفَ عِندَ مَتَٰعِنَا فَأَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَٰدِقِينَ,"They said: O our father, we went off on foot racing with one another and shooting arrows and we left Joseph by our clothes and provisions to look after them. Then the wolf ate him. You are not going to believe us, even though we are absolutely truthful in what we have told you."
"They showed him the shirt with false blood on it. (Their father) said: ""It is not so; you have made up the story. Yet endurance is best. I seek the help of God alone for what you impute.""",17,12,وَجَآءُو عَلَىٰ قَمِيصِهِۦ بِدَمٍ كَذِبٍ قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ وَٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ,"They confirmed their story with a trick. They brought the shirt of Joseph stained with the blood of something else, giving the impression that it was a sign of the wolf’s having eaten him. Jacob realised that they were lying, because the shirt was not torn, and he said to them: The matter is not as you have said. Instead, your souls have made an evil action that you committed seem good to you. I will exercise beautiful patience without any complaint. Allah is the One from Whom aid is requested against what you mention about the matter of Joseph."
"A caravan happened to pass, and sent the water-carrier to bring water from the well. He let down his bucket (and pulled Joseph up with it). ""What luck,"" said the man; ""here is a boy;"" and they hid him as an item of merchandise; but what they did was known to God.",18,12,وَجَآءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌ فَأَرْسَلُوا۟ وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُۥ قَالَ يَٰبُشْرَىٰ هَٰذَا غُلَٰمٌ وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَٰعَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,"A passing caravan came by and they sent someone to draw water for them. He lowered his bucket into the well and Joseph caught hold of the rope. When the person who had lowered the bucket saw him, he happily said, ‘Good news! Here is a boy!’ The water-drawer and a few others hid him from the rest of the caravan, regarding him to be merchandise that they could trade. Allah knew what they were doing with Joseph when they treated him as an item of sale. No action of theirs was hidden from Him."
And they sold him as worthless for a few paltry dirham.,19,12,وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍۭ بَخْسٍ دَرَٰهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ وَكَانُوا۟ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلزَّٰهِدِينَ,The water-drawer and his companions sold him in Egypt for a petty amount of a few silver coins that could be easily counted due to their small number. They sold him cheaply because they wanted to get rid of him quickly. They had realised from his condition that he was not a slave and they were afraid of his family. Allah was Merciful to him by not keeping him with them for very long.
"The Egyptian who bought him instructed his wife: ""House him honourably. He may be of use to us. We may even adopt him as a son."" So, We firmly established Joseph in the land, and taught him the interpretation of dreams. God dominated in his affairs, though most men do not know.",20,12,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِى ٱشْتَرَىٰهُ مِن مِّصْرَ لِٱمْرَأَتِهِۦٓ أَكْرِمِى مَثْوَىٰهُ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَنفَعَنَآ أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُۥ وَلَدًا وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلِنُعَلِّمَهُۥ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلْأَحَادِيثِ وَٱللَّهُ غَالِبٌ عَلَىٰٓ أَمْرِهِۦ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"The man from Egypt who had purchased him said to his wife, ‘Be good to him and look after him well. He may benefit us by doing some of the things we need, or we may adopt him as a child’. Just as I saved Joseph from being killed, removed him from the well and made the heart of the minister soft towards him, I established him in Egypt, to teach him the interpretation of dreams. Allah is in full control of His affair, and His affair will come into effect. No one can compel Him, may He be glorified; but most people – who are actually disbelievers – do not know that."
When he reached the prime of life We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward those who are good.,21,12,وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُۥٓ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُ حُكْمًا وَعِلْمًا وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"When Joseph reached the height of his spiritual and physical strength, I gave him understanding and knowledge. With a reward similar to what I gave him, I reward those who do good by following Me."
"But she in whose house he resided wished to seduce him and, closing the doors, said: ""Come into me. ""God forbid!"" he said; ""he is my master who has approved my stay. Surely those who act wrongly do not prosper.""",22,12,وَرَٰوَدَتْهُ ٱلَّتِى هُوَ فِى بَيْتِهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ وَغَلَّقَتِ ٱلْأَبْوَٰبَ وَقَالَتْ هَيْتَ لَكَ قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ رَبِّىٓ أَحْسَنَ مَثْوَاىَ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"The wife of the minister tried cunningly and by the use of a trick to get Joseph (peace be upon him) to commit an indecent act. She shut the doors to ensure that they were alone and she said to him, ‘Come towards me!’ Joseph said: I seek protection in Allah from what you are calling me toward. My master has taken good care of me in my stay here and I will never betray him. If I betray him, I will be a wrongdoer; and those who do wrong do not succeed."
"But the woman desired him, and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his Lord. This was so that We may avert both evil and lechery from him, for he was one of Our chosen devotees.",23,12,وَلَقَدْ هَمَّتْ بِهِۦ وَهَمَّ بِهَا لَوْلَآ أَن رَّءَا بُرْهَٰنَ رَبِّهِۦ كَذَٰلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ ٱلسُّوٓءَ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءَ إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,She had desired to commit the indecent act and the same thought would have crossed his mind had he not seen Allah’s signs that prevented him and distanced him from that. I showed him My proofs to keep him pure from evil and distance him from unlawful sexual relations and betrayal. Joseph was one of My servants whom I chose for messengership and prophethood.
"Both of them raced to the door, and she (grabbed and) rent his shirt from behind. They met her lord outside the door. ""There is no other penalty for a man,"" said she, ""who wanted to outrage your wife but imprisonment or grievous punishment.""",24,12,وَٱسْتَبَقَا ٱلْبَابَ وَقَدَّتْ قَمِيصَهُۥ مِن دُبُرٍ وَأَلْفَيَا سَيِّدَهَا لَدَا ٱلْبَابِ قَالَتْ مَا جَزَآءُ مَنْ أَرَادَ بِأَهْلِكَ سُوٓءًا إِلَّآ أَن يُسْجَنَ أَوْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"They raced for the door: Joseph to save himself, and she to prevent him from leaving. She caught hold of his shirt to stop him from leaving and she tore it from behind. At the door they found her husband. The minister’s wife deceptively said to him: The punishment for the person who intended to commit an indecent act with your wife, O minister, can only be prison or that he be given a painful punishment."
"(Joseph) said: ""It was she who wanted to seduce me."" And a witness from her family testified: ""If the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth, and he is a liar.",25,12,قَالَ هِىَ رَٰوَدَتْنِى عَن نَّفْسِى وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن كَانَ قَمِيصُهُۥ قُدَّ مِن قُبُلٍ فَصَدَقَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"Joseph (peace be upon him) said: It was she who tried to get me to commit an indecent act. I did not intend it from her. Allah then made a child from her family speak in the cradle and it testified saying: If Joseph’s shirt is torn from the front, then it indicates that she is truthful, because she was trying to stop him from coming on to her; and then he will be lying."
"But if the shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar, and he speaks the truth.""",26,12,وَإِن كَانَ قَمِيصُهُۥ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ فَكَذَبَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"But if his shirt is torn from behind, then that is an indication that he is truthful, because she was trying to seduce him whilst he was running away; and she will be lying."
"When the husband saw the shirt torn at the back, he said: ""Surely this is a woman's ruse, and the wiles of women are great.",27,12,فَلَمَّا رَءَا قَمِيصَهُۥ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ قَالَ إِنَّهُۥ مِن كَيْدِكُنَّ إِنَّ كَيْدَكُنَّ عَظِيمٌ,"When the minister saw that Joseph’s shirt was torn from behind, he realised that Joseph was telling the truth and he said: This accusation that you cast on him is part of your trickery, O women. Your trickery is certainly strong."
"Ignore this affair, O Joseph; and you, O woman, ask forgiveness for your sin, for you were surely errant.""",28,12,يُوسُفُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَٰذَا وَٱسْتَغْفِرِى لِذَنۢبِكِ إِنَّكِ كُنتِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاطِـِٔينَ,"He said to Joseph: O Joseph, completely ignore this and do not mention it to anyone. And you, woman, ask forgiveness for your sin, for you committed a sin by trying to seduce Joseph."
"In the city the women gossiped: ""The minister's wife longs after her page. He has captured her heart. We think she is in clear error.""",29,12,وَقَالَ نِسْوَةٌ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ ٱمْرَأَتُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ تُرَٰوِدُ فَتَىٰهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ قَدْ شَغَفَهَا حُبًّا إِنَّا لَنَرَىٰهَا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,The news spread in the city and a group of women disapprovingly said: The wife of the minister is calling her slave towards herself. His love has penetrated her heart. We think she is clearly misguided in trying to seduce him and because of her love for him despite his being her slave.
"When she heard their slanderings, she sent for them and prepared a banquet, and gave each of them a knife (for paring fruit), and called (to Joseph): ""Come out before them."" When they saw him, the women were so wonderstruck they cut their hands, and exclaimed: ""O Lord preserve us! He is no mortal but an honourable angel.""",30,12,فَلَمَّا سَمِعَتْ بِمَكْرِهِنَّ أَرْسَلَتْ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَعْتَدَتْ لَهُنَّ مُتَّكَـًٔا وَءَاتَتْ كُلَّ وَٰحِدَةٍ مِّنْهُنَّ سِكِّينًا وَقَالَتِ ٱخْرُجْ عَلَيْهِنَّ فَلَمَّا رَأَيْنَهُۥٓ أَكْبَرْنَهُۥ وَقَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ وَقُلْنَ حَٰشَ لِلَّهِ مَا هَٰذَا بَشَرًا إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا مَلَكٌ كَرِيمٌ,"When the wife of the minister heard of their disapproval of her and their gossip about her, she sent an invitation to them to come and see Joseph, so that they would excuse her. She prepared for them a place with cushions and pillows and she gave each one of the women who were invited a knife to cut food. She then said to Joseph (peace be upon him), ‘Go out to them!’ When they saw him, they were taken aback by his beauty and stunned by his handsomeness. As a result, they cut their hands with the knives that were meant for cutting food and they said: Allah is free of faults! This boy is not human. The beauty he possesses is not found in human beings. He can only be one of the noble angels."
"She said: ""This is the one you blamed me for. I did desire his person, but he preserved himself from sin. Yet in case he does not do my bidding he will be put into prison and disgraced.""",31,12,قَالَتْ فَذَٰلِكُنَّ ٱلَّذِى لُمْتُنَّنِى فِيهِ وَلَقَدْ رَٰوَدتُّهُۥ عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ فَٱسْتَعْصَمَ وَلَئِن لَّمْ يَفْعَلْ مَآ ءَامُرُهُۥ لَيُسْجَنَنَّ وَلَيَكُونًا مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰغِرِينَ,"The wife of the minister said to those women when she saw what happened to them, ‘This is the slave who you blamed me for loving. I desired him and tried to entice him, but he remained pure and refused. If he does not, in the future, do what I desire, he will go to prison and will become one of those who are disgraced’."
"(Joseph) prayed: ""O Lord, dearer is prison than what they invite me to. Unless You turn their guiles away from me I shall succumb to their charms and thus become a pagan.""",32,12,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱلسِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِمَّا يَدْعُونَنِىٓ إِلَيْهِ وَإِلَّا تَصْرِفْ عَنِّى كَيْدَهُنَّ أَصْبُ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"Joseph (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord saying: O my Lord, prison, which they threaten me with, is preferable to me than the shameful act they call me towards. If You do not remove their scheme from me, I may incline to them and I will become one of the ignorant ones – if I give in to them and do what they want me to do."
"His Lord heard his prayer, and averted the women's wiles from him. He verily hears and knows everything.",33,12,فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥ فَصَرَفَ عَنْهُ كَيْدَهُنَّ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Allah answered his prayer and removed the scheme of the minister’s wife and that of the women of the city from him. He, may He be glorified, heard the prayer of Joseph – He hears the prayer of any person who prays to Him. He knew the condition of Joseph and He knows the condition of everyone besides him."
And yet in spite of having seen these clear proofs they found it proper to incarcerate him for a time.,34,12,ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُا۟ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُۥ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,"Then the view of the minister and his people, after they had seen evidence of his innocence, was that they should put him in prison for an unknown period, so that the scandal was not exposed."
"Two other youths were imprisoned along with him. Said one of them: ""I dreamt that I was pressing grapes;"" and the other: ""I dreamt that I was carrying bread on my head, and the birds were pecking at it. You tell us the meaning of this. You seem to be a righteous man.""",35,12,وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ ٱلسِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَآ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰنِىٓ أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا وَقَالَ ٱلْءَاخَرُ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰنِىٓ أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِى خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِۦٓ إِنَّا نَرَىٰكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"They put him in prison and two youngsters entered the prison with him. One of these youngsters said to Joseph, ‘I saw in my dream that I was pressing grapes to make wine’. The other said: I saw that I was carrying bread on my head, from which birds were eating. Tell us, O Joseph, the interpretation of what we saw. We regard you to be from those who do good, so be good to us by interpreting our dreams."
"(Joseph) answered: ""I will give you its interpretation before the food you are served arrives. This knowledge is one of the things my Lord has taught me. I have given up the religion of those who do not believe in God and deny the life to come.",36,12,قَالَ لَا يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِۦٓ إِلَّا نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمَا ذَٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِى رَبِّىٓ إِنِّى تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"Joseph (peace be upon him) said: No food allocated to you by the king or anyone else will come you, except that I will explain to you its essence and form before it comes to you. The interpretation I give you is what my Lord has taught me. It is not soothsaying or astrology. I have left the religion of a people who do not have faith in Allah and who denounce the Afterlife, although they acknowledge it within themselves."
"I follow the faith of my fathers, of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. We cannot associate anyone with God. This is among God's favours to us and to all mankind; but most men are not grateful.",37,12,وَٱتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ ءَابَآءِىٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ مَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ ذَٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"Joseph said that he followed the path of his fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: the path of worshipping Allah alone. He said it was not right for them to associate anything with Allah, Who is alone in His Oneness. Enabling them to worship Allah alone and have the faith which he and his fathers had was from the grace of Allah upon them. It was also from the grace of Allah upon all people, since He sent the prophets to them with that message; yet most people are not thankful to Allah for His blessings, and instead ungratefully disbelieve in Him."
"(Tell me) O fellow-prisoners, are a number of gods better, or one God omnipotent?",38,12,يَٰصَىٰحِبَىِ ٱلسِّجْنِ ءَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَٰحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,"Joseph then addressed the two men in the prison, asking whether worshipping many gods was better or worshipping Allah, the One, Who has no partner, the Prevailing over all else, Who none can prevail over."
"(What) you worship besides Him are nothing but names that you and your fathers have assigned, for which no sanction has been sent down by God. Authority belongs to God alone. He commands that you worship none but Him. This is the right way; but most men are ignorant.",39,12,مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَسْمَآءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُم مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَٰنٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِيَّاهُ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Joseph told them that they only worshipped names besides Allah, which have not been designated by Allah, but were what they and their ancestors had called gods – yet they had no share in divinity. Allah had sent no proof showing that giving these names was correct. The command in all creation is Allah’s alone, and does not belong to these names, which they and their ancestors had come up with. Allah, glory be to Him, has instructed that you worship Him alone, and has forbidden that you should associate others with Him. Worshipping Allah alone is the straight path, which has no deviation in it. Most people do not know this, and therefore they associate other things with Allah, worshipping some of what Allah has created."
"O fellow-prisoners, one of you will serve wine to your master, the other will be crucified and the birds will peck at his brain. Determined is the matter of your inquiry.""",40,12,يَٰصَىٰحِبَىِ ٱلسِّجْنِ أَمَّآ أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِى رَبَّهُۥ خَمْرًا وَأَمَّا ٱلْءَاخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِن رَّأْسِهِۦ قُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ,"Joseph told his two companions in the prison that he would interpret their dreams for them. He told them that the one who dreamed that he was pressing grapes to make wine would get out of the prison, and return to his work, and would serve the king. As for the one who dreamed that he was carrying bread on his head that the birds were eating from, he would be killed and crucified, and the birds would eat from his head. The matter they asked for an opinion on was settled and would come to pass. It was an inevitable reality."
"And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: ""Remember me to your lord;"" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.",41,12,وَقَالَ لِلَّذِى ظَنَّ أَنَّهُۥ نَاجٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱذْكُرْنِى عِندَ رَبِّكَ فَأَنسَىٰهُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِۦ فَلَبِثَ فِى ٱلسِّجْنِ بِضْعَ سِنِينَ,"Joseph asked the one he considered to be saved of the two, the wine bearer of the king, to mention his story and his situation to the king, so that he might release him from prison. Satan made the man forget to mention Joseph to the king, so he stayed in prison for several years after that."
"(One day) the king said (to his courtiers): ""I saw seven fat cows in a dream being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven ears of corn that were green and seven others that were seared. O courtiers, tell me the significance of my dream, if you know how to interpret them.""",42,12,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰ سَبْعَ بَقَرَٰتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعَ سُنۢبُلَٰتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَٰتٍ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلَأُ أَفْتُونِى فِى رُءْيَٰىَ إِن كُنتُمْ لِلرُّءْيَا تَعْبُرُونَ,"One day the king said that he had seen a dream in which seven fat cows were being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn. He asked the notables and nobles to tell him the interpretation of his dream, if they knew how to interpret dreams."
"""They were only confused dreams,"" they said; ""we do not know how to interpret them.""",43,12,قَالُوٓا۟ أَضْغَٰثُ أَحْلَٰمٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَأْوِيلِ ٱلْأَحْلَٰمِ بِعَٰلِمِينَ,"They said that his vision was a jumble of dreams, and because of this it could not be interpreted; and that they were not knowledgeable about the interpretation of mixed-up dreams."
"Then the servant, who of the two had been released, remembering (Joseph), said: ""I will give you its interpretation; let me go for it.""",44,12,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَٱدَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ أَنَا۠ أُنَبِّئُكُم بِتَأْوِيلِهِۦ فَأَرْسِلُونِ,"The wine bearer – who, of the two men who had been imprisoned, had been saved – then remembered Joseph (peace be upon him) after some time and that he was able to interpret dreams, so he said that he would tell them the interpretation of the king’s vision after asking someone who knew how to interpret it. He asked to be sent by the king to Joseph so that he could interpret his dream."
"(And coming to the prison) he said: ""O Joseph the truthful, tell us (the meaning of) seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn and seven seared, that I may go back to the people and tell them.""",45,12,يُوسُفُ أَيُّهَا ٱلصِّدِّيقُ أَفْتِنَا فِى سَبْعِ بَقَرَٰتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعِ سُنۢبُلَٰتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَٰتٍ لَّعَلِّىٓ أَرْجِعُ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"When the man who had been saved reached Joseph, he asked Joseph, the truthful, to inform them of the interpretation of someone dreaming about seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin cows, and seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn, so that he might return to the king and those with him and they might know the explanation of the king’s dream, and also know the virtue and rank of Joseph."
"He said: ""Sow as usual for seven years, and after reaping leave the corn in the ears, except the little you need for food.",46,12,قَالَ تَزْرَعُونَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ دَأَبًا فَمَا حَصَدتُّمْ فَذَرُوهُ فِى سُنۢبُلِهِۦٓ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ,"Explaining this dream, Joseph said that they should plant really well for seven consecutive years. And what they harvested in each of these seven years, they should leave in the ears of corn so that it would not rot, except for a little which they needed to eat from the corn."
"Then there will come seven years of hardship which will consume the grain you had laid up against them, except a little you may have stored away.",47,12,ثُمَّ يَأْتِى مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ سَبْعٌ شِدَادٌ يَأْكُلْنَ مَا قَدَّمْتُمْ لَهُنَّ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّمَّا تُحْصِنُونَ,"Then after these seven fertile years in which they successfully grew food, seven barren years would come, when the people would eat all they had harvested in the fertile years, except for a little of what they had stored, from which they would be able to sow seeds."
"This will be followed by a year of rain, and people shall press (the grapes).""",48,12,ثُمَّ يَأْتِى مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ عَامٌ فِيهِ يُغَاثُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَفِيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ,"Then after these barren years a year would come in which the rains would fall, and the crops would grow, and the people would press those things that need pressing, such as grapes, olives and cane."
"The king said: ""Bring him to me. So when the messenger came to Joseph, he said: ""Go back to your lord and ask him: 'How fare the women who had cut their hands?' My Lord is cognisant of their guile.""",49,12,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِى بِهِۦ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُ ٱلرَّسُولُ قَالَ ٱرْجِعْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَسْـَٔلْهُ مَا بَالُ ٱلنِّسْوَةِ ٱلَّٰتِى قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ إِنَّ رَبِّى بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ,"The king told his servants, when Joseph’s explanation of his dream reached him, to release Joseph from prison and bring him to him. When the king’s messenger came to Joseph, he told him to return to his master, the king, and ask him about the story of the women who cut their hands, so that his innocence would be made clear before he left the prison. Joseph said that his Lord was aware of how they had tried to seduce him, as nothing is hidden from Him."
"The king asked the women: ""What was the affair of seducing Joseph?"" ""God preserve us,"" they said; ""we know no evil against him."" The wife of the minister said: ""The truth has now come out. It was I who desired to seduce him, but he is indeed a man of virtue."" --",50,12,قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ إِذْ رَٰوَدتُّنَّ يُوسُفَ عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ قُلْنَ حَٰشَ لِلَّهِ مَا عَلِمْنَا عَلَيْهِ مِن سُوٓءٍ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْـَٰٔنَ حَصْحَصَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَنَا۠ رَٰوَدتُّهُۥ عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"The king, addressing the women, asked what happened when they called Joseph through trickery. Was it to commit immorality with them? The wife of the minister, confessing what she had done, said that now the truth had become clear, that she tried to seduce him, and he did not try to seduce her, and that he was truthful in claiming that he was innocent of what she had accused him of."
"(At this Joseph remarked:) ""From this (the Minister) should know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed.",51,12,ذَٰلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّى لَمْ أَخُنْهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى كَيْدَ ٱلْخَآئِنِينَ,"The wife of the minister said that this disclosure was so that Joseph would know through her confession that it was she who had tried to seduce him and that he was truthful, and that she had not lied about him in his absence, as it had become clear to her from what had happened that Allah does not give success to those who lie and scheme."
"But I do not wish to absolve myself, for the soul is prone to evil, unless my Lord have mercy. Indeed my Lord is forgiving and kind."" --",52,12,وَمَآ أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِىٓ إِنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌۢ بِٱلسُّوٓءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّ رَبِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"The minister’s wife continued speaking, saying that she was not free of blame from having wanted to do something bad, and she was not trying to justify herself, because the human self commands often to evil. This is because of its inclination towards what it desires and the difficulty of holding back from it, except for those whom Allah shows mercy to, preventing their egos from commending them to evil. Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate towards those of His servants who repent to Him."
"When the king heard this he said: ""Bring him to me. I shall take him in my special service."" When he had talked to him, he said: ""Today you are established in a rank of trust with us.""",53,12,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِى بِهِۦٓ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِى فَلَمَّا كَلَّمَهُۥ قَالَ إِنَّكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ لَدَيْنَا مَكِينٌ أَمِينٌ,"When Joseph’s innocence and knowledge became evident, the king asked his servants to bring Joseph to him to serve him. So they brought Joseph to him, and when Joseph spoke to him, his knowledge and high intelligence became evident so the king said to him “from this day, you are someone of rank, status and trust”."
"""Appoint me over the granaries of the land,"" (he said); ""I shall be a knowledgeable keeper.""",54,12,قَالَ ٱجْعَلْنِى عَلَىٰ خَزَآئِنِ ٱلْأَرْضِ إِنِّى حَفِيظٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Joseph asked the king to put him in charge of taking care of the storehouses of wealth and food in the land of Egypt, because he would be a trustworthy guardian, with knowledge and insight about what he was taking care of."
"Thus We gave Joseph authority in the land so that he lived wherever he liked. We bestow Our favours on whomsoever We please, and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste.",55,12,وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَآءُ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Just as Allah proved Joseph’s innocence and released him from prison, He also established him in Egypt, so that he could go and live in any place he wished. Allah gives from His mercy to whomever of His servants He wills in this world, and does not allow the reward of those who do good to be lost, giving it to them in full, and nothing less."
And certainly the recompense of the life to come is better for those who believe and follow the right path.,56,12,وَلَأَجْرُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ يَتَّقُونَ,"The reward of Allah, which He has prepared in the Afterlife, is certainly better than the reward of this life for those who have faith in Allah and who were mindful of Him, following what He has ordered and staying away from what He has prohibited."
"The brothers of Joseph came (to Egypt) and visited him. He recognised them, though they did not recognise him.",57,12,وَجَآءَ إِخْوَةُ يُوسُفَ فَدَخَلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ فَعَرَفَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُۥ مُنكِرُونَ,"The brothers of Joseph came to Egypt with their merchandise, and came before Joseph. He recognised that they were his brothers; but they did not recognise that he was their brother, because of the length of time that had passed and because of how much he had changed, since he had been just a boy when they threw him in the well."
"When he had supplied their provisions, he said to them: ""Bring your (half) brother with you. Have you not seen that I have given full measure, and that I am the best of hosts?",58,12,وَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُم بِجَهَازِهِمْ قَالَ ٱئْتُونِى بِأَخٍ لَّكُم مِّنْ أَبِيكُمْ أَلَا تَرَوْنَ أَنِّىٓ أُوفِى ٱلْكَيْلَ وَأَنَا۠ خَيْرُ ٱلْمُنزِلِينَ,"When he had given them the supplies and provisions they came for, and after they had informed him that they had a brother on their father’s side who they had left with their father, Joseph asked them to bring their brother on their father’s side and he would give them more supplies. He asked them if they did not see that he gave full measure, not subtracting from it at all, and that he was the best of hosts."
"But if you do not bring him with you, then I shall have no grain for you, nor should you come back to me.""",59,12,فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى بِهِۦ فَلَا كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِى وَلَا تَقْرَبُونِ,"Joseph told them that if they did not bring the brother asked for, then it would be clear that they were not telling the truth in their claim that they had a brother on their father’s side. He told them that in that case he would not give them any measure of food, and they should not approach his country."
"They said: ""We shall request his father, and will certainly do that.""",60,12,قَالُوا۟ سَنُرَٰوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ وَإِنَّا لَفَٰعِلُونَ,"His brothers replied to him, saying that they would ask for him from their father, and would work hard to bring him, doing what Joseph instructed them without fail."
"Then he ordered his servants: ""Put their money back in their packs: They may find it on reaching home, and perhaps come again.""",61,12,وَقَالَ لِفِتْيَٰنِهِ ٱجْعَلُوا۟ بِضَٰعَتَهُمْ فِى رِحَالِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْرِفُونَهَآ إِذَا ٱنقَلَبُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"Joseph told his servants to return the merchandise of these people to them, so that they would realize on their return that they did not do trade with it, which would force them to return again with their brother, to prove their integrity to Joseph, and so that he would receive their merchandise from them."
"When they returned to their father, they said: ""O father, a further measure has been denied us. So send our brother with us that he may bring more grain. We shall take care of him.""",62,12,فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَبِيهِمْ قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا ٱلْكَيْلُ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَآ أَخَانَا نَكْتَلْ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَحَٰفِظُونَ,"When they returned to their father, and told him about the generosity of Joseph to them, they also told their father that any further measure would be denied to them if they did not bring their brother with them. They asked him to send him with them, because if he did so they would be given provisions. They promised their father that they would take good care of him, bringing him back safely."
"He replied: ""Should I trust you with him as I did his brother? But God is the best of guardians, and most merciful of all.""",63,12,قَالَ هَلْ ءَامَنُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ إِلَّا كَمَآ أَمِنتُكُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَخِيهِ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ حَٰفِظًا وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"Their father asked them if he should trust them with him as he had trusted them with his full brother, Joseph. He had trusted them with Joseph and made them promise to take care of him, and they had not done what they promised, so he did not trust their promise to take care of his brother; but he trusted in Allah, for He is the best of guardians to whom He wills, and the most Merciful of the merciful to whom He wills."
"When they unpacked their goods they said: ""O father, what more can we ask? Look, even our money has been returned. We shall go and bring a camel-load more of grain for our family, and take good care of our brother. That will be an easy measure.""",64,12,وَلَمَّا فَتَحُوا۟ مَتَٰعَهُمْ وَجَدُوا۟ بِضَٰعَتَهُمْ رُدَّتْ إِلَيْهِمْ قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَا مَا نَبْغِى هَٰذِهِۦ بِضَٰعَتُنَا رُدَّتْ إِلَيْنَا وَنَمِيرُ أَهْلَنَا وَنَحْفَظُ أَخَانَا وَنَزْدَادُ كَيْلَ بَعِيرٍ ذَٰلِكَ كَيْلٌ يَسِيرٌ,"When they opened the bags containing the food which they had brought, they found what they had traded for it had been returned to them. They asked their father what more could they ask for from this king after such generosity. What they had traded for their food had been returned by the king as a favour from him to them. They told their father that they would get food for their family and protect their brother from what he feared might happen to him, and they would get an extra camel load because of him accompanying them – an extra camel load being an easy matter for the king."
"He said: ""I will never send him with you until you swear by God that you will bring him back to me, unless all of you are overtaken (by misfortune)."" When they had given their promise, he said: ""God is witness to our conversation.""",65,12,قَالَ لَنْ أُرْسِلَهُۥ مَعَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تُؤْتُونِ مَوْثِقًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لَتَأْتُنَّنِى بِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن يُحَاطَ بِكُمْ فَلَمَّآ ءَاتَوْهُ مَوْثِقَهُمْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,"Their father told them he would not send their brother with them until they had sworn by Allah that they would bring him back, unless destruction overwhelmed them all and none of them remained, and they were unable to do anything about it or to return. When they had given their father a firm promise in Allah's name, he said that Allah was a witness over what they said, and His witnessing was sufficient for them."
"(As they were leaving) their father said to them: ""O my sons, do not seek one approach but employ different ways (of attaining your object). If anything should befall you from God I shall not be able to avert it, for all authority belongs to God. I have placed my trust in Him, and the trusting should rely on Him alone.""",66,12,وَقَالَ يَٰبَنِىَّ لَا تَدْخُلُوا۟ مِنۢ بَابٍ وَٰحِدٍ وَٱدْخُلُوا۟ مِنْ أَبْوَٰبٍ مُّتَفَرِّقَةٍ وَمَآ أُغْنِى عَنكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,"Also, their father advised them not to enter Egypt from one gate all together, but to enter from different gates. This would be safer in terms of someone harming all of them if someone wished to do so. He did not say this so as to be able to stop any harm that Allah willed for them, or to bring them any benefit which Allah did not will for them, because the decree is Allah’s alone, and the command is His alone. Their father said that he placed his trust in Him alone concerning everything in his life, and that those who trust should put their trust in Him alone concerning everything in their lives."
"When they entered as their father had advised them, nothing could avail them against (the will of) God, yet it confirmed a premonition Jacob had, for verily he had knowledge as We had taught him, though most men do not know.",67,12,وَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ أَبُوهُم مَّا كَانَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ إِلَّا حَاجَةً فِى نَفْسِ يَعْقُوبَ قَضَىٰهَا وَإِنَّهُۥ لَذُو عِلْمٍ لِّمَا عَلَّمْنَٰهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"So they journeyed with Joseph’s full brother. When they entered through different gates, as their father had instructed them, it did not stop what Allah had decreed for them in any way. It was just Jacob’s concern for his sons which he showed, advising them, knowing that the decree is Allah’s alone. He knew what Allah had taught him in terms of faith in the divine decree and taking precautions, but most people do not know this."
"When they came to Joseph he made his brother his guest, and said: ""I am your brother. So do not grieve for what they had done.""",68,12,وَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ ءَاوَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ أَخَاهُ قَالَ إِنِّىٓ أَنَا۠ أَخُوكَ فَلَا تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"When the brothers of Joseph came before him, together with his full brother, he drew his full brother close to him and said to him privately that he was his brother Joseph, and that he should not feel sad about the reckless behaviour of his other brothers, hurting and resenting the two of them, and throwing Joseph in the well."
"When he had given them their provisions he put his goblet in his brother's saddle-bag. Then a crier announced: ""O men of the caravan, you are thieves.""",69,12,فَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُم بِجَهَازِهِمْ جَعَلَ ٱلسِّقَايَةَ فِى رَحْلِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ أَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ أَيَّتُهَا ٱلْعِيرُ إِنَّكُمْ لَسَٰرِقُونَ,"So when Joseph instructed his servants to load the camels of his brothers with food, he put the measuring bowl of the king, which the food was measured with for those who came to get provisions, into the bag of his full brother, without their knowledge, in order to have him stay with him. When they were to travel and return back to their family, a caller called after them, saying that they, with their camels loaded with provisions, were thieves."
"They turned to them and asked: ""What is it you have lost?""",70,12,قَالُوا۟ وَأَقْبَلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِم مَّاذَا تَفْقِدُونَ,"The brothers of Joseph, turning towards the person calling after them and his companions who were with him, asked what they were missing that made them accuse them of stealing."
"""We cannot find the master's goblet. Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel-load of grain; I vouch for it.""",71,12,قَالُوا۟ نَفْقِدُ صُوَاعَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَلِمَن جَآءَ بِهِۦ حِمْلُ بَعِيرٍ وَأَنَا۠ بِهِۦ زَعِيمٌ,"The caller and his companions, who were with him, said to the brothers of Joseph that they were missing the bowl of the king which they measured with. Whoever produced the bowl of the king before the inspection would get a reward, which would be a camel load, and the speaker guaranteed this to whoever did so."
"They said: ""We swear by God. You know we did not come to commit any crime in the land, nor are we thieves.""",72,12,قَالُوا۟ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتُم مَّا جِئْنَا لِنُفْسِدَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كُنَّا سَٰرِقِينَ,"The brothers of Joseph swore by Allah that those accusing them knew they were free of blame and innocent of this, as they could see from their situation, and that they had not come to the land of Egypt to cause corruption in it, and that they had never been thieves."
"""What should be the punishment,"" they were asked, ""in case you are liars?""",73,12,قَالُوا۟ فَمَا جَزَٰٓؤُهُۥٓ إِن كُنتُمْ كَٰذِبِينَ,"The caller and his companions asked what the punishment for theft among them was, in case they should be proved to be liars in their claim that they were innocent of the theft."
"""The punishment for that (should be),"" they said, ""that he in whose luggage it is found should be held as punishment. This is how we repay the wrong-doers.""",74,12,قَالُوا۟ جَزَٰٓؤُهُۥ مَن وُجِدَ فِى رَحْلِهِۦ فَهُوَ جَزَٰٓؤُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,Joseph’s brothers said that the payment for any thief among them was that the person in whose bag the stolen item was found would become the slave of whoever he stole from. This punishment of being made into a slave is the way they punished thieves.
"So he searched their saddle-bags before his brother's, then produced the cup from his brother's bag. That is how We planned an excuse for Joseph, for under the law of the king he could not detain his brother unless God so willed. We raise the status of whom We please. Over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing.",75,12,فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَخْرَجَهَا مِن وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ كَذَٰلِكَ كِدْنَا لِيُوسُفَ مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِى دِينِ ٱلْمَلِكِ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَٰتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِى عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ,"So they returned them to Joseph to inspect their bags. He started by inspecting the bags of his half-brothers before inspecting the bag of his full brother, to cover up what he was doing. Then he inspected the bag of his full brother, and took the bowl of the king out of it. As Allah planned things for Joseph by arranging to have the bowl put into the bag of his brother, He also arranged – for the benefit of Joseph – that his brothers would be given the punishment of their country, which was the enslavement of the thief. This would not have come to pass if it had been according to the punishment of the king for thieves, which was beating and fining. Allah is able to arrange matters in whatever way He wills. He raises the ranks of those of His servants whom He wills, as He raised the rank of Joseph. Above every possessor of knowledge is someone more knowledgeable than them, and above the knowledge of everyone is the knowledge of Allah, Who knows all things."
"Said the brothers: ""If he has stolen (no wonder), his brother had stolen before."" But Joseph kept this secret and did not disclose it to them, and said (to himself): ""You are worse in the degree of evil, for God knows better of what you allege.""",76,12,قَالُوٓا۟ إِن يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَّهُۥ مِن قَبْلُ فَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِى نَفْسِهِۦ وَلَمْ يُبْدِهَا لَهُمْ قَالَ أَنتُمْ شَرٌّ مَّكَانًا وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ,"The brothers of Joseph said that if he had stolen it was not surprising, since a full brother of his had stolen before he had, meaning Joseph (peace be upon him). Joseph hid his hurt at what they said, thinking to himself that their envy and the bad actions they had committed were evil itself in this context, and Allah knew best the lies that came from them."
"They said: ""O Minister, he has an aged father, so keep one of us in his place. We see you are a virtuous man.""",77,12,قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ إِنَّ لَهُۥٓ أَبًا شَيْخًا كَبِيرًا فَخُذْ أَحَدَنَا مَكَانَهُۥٓ إِنَّا نَرَىٰكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Joseph’s brothers told him that their father was old and elderly and loved their brother dearly. They asked him to take one of them instead of him, saying that they saw that he was a doer of good in his dealings with them and others, and they asked him to be generous with them by doing this."
"""May God forgive us,"" he said, ""if we hold any one but him with whom we found our property, or else we would be unjust.""",78,12,قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ أَن نَّأْخُذَ إِلَّا مَن وَجَدْنَا مَتَٰعَنَا عِندَهُۥٓ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّظَٰلِمُونَ,"Joseph asked for protection from Allah that they should wrong someone innocent with the sin of a wrongdoer. If they took someone other than the person in whose bag they found the bowl of the king, then they would be wrongdoers, because they would be punishing someone who was innocent and letting a criminal go free."
"When they despaired of (persuading) him, they went aside to confer. The oldest of them said: ""You know that your father has pledged you in the name of God, and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of Joseph before. I will not leave this place unless my father permits or God decides for me, for He is the best of all judges.",79,12,فَلَمَّا ٱسْتَيْـَٔسُوا۟ مِنْهُ خَلَصُوا۟ نَجِيًّا قَالَ كَبِيرُهُمْ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ أَبَاكُمْ قَدْ أَخَذَ عَلَيْكُم مَّوْثِقًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمِن قَبْلُ مَا فَرَّطتُمْ فِى يُوسُفَ فَلَنْ أَبْرَحَ ٱلْأَرْضَ حَتَّىٰ يَأْذَنَ لِىٓ أَبِىٓ أَوْ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ لِى وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَٰكِمِينَ,"When they despaired of Joseph responding to their request, they went away from the people to consult with each other. Their oldest brother asked them if they remembered that their father had taken a firm promise in the name of Allah from them that they would return his son to him, unless they were completely overwhelmed by what they were unable to repel, and that before that they had failed with regards to Joseph, and had not kept their promise to their father concerning him. He said that he would not leave the land of Egypt until his father permitted him to return to him, or Allah decreed that he take his brother back. Allah is the Best of Judges, judging with truth and justice."
"So, go to your father and tell him: 'O father, your son has committed a theft. We bear witness to only what we know; we could not prevent the unknown.",80,12,ٱرْجِعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَبِيكُمْ فَقُولُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَآ إِنَّ ٱبْنَكَ سَرَقَ وَمَا شَهِدْنَآ إِلَّا بِمَا عَلِمْنَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِلْغَيْبِ حَٰفِظِينَ,"The oldest brother told them to return to their father and tell him that his son had stolen, and the minister of Egypt had taken him as a slave as a punishment for his theft, and that they only related to him what they knew from seeing the bowl produced from his bag. They did not know that he stole things, and if they had known this they would not have made a promise to their father to return him."
"Enquire from the people of that city, or ask the men of the caravan with whom we have come. We are verily speaking the truth.'""",81,12,وَسْـَٔلِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ ٱلَّتِى كُنَّا فِيهَا وَٱلْعِيرَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَقْبَلْنَا فِيهَا وَإِنَّا لَصَٰدِقُونَ,"In order to confirm that they were telling the truth, the brothers told their father to ask the people of the town where they had been, and to ask the people of the caravan they had come with, and that these people would tell him the same thing as they had. They said they were telling the truth in what they told him about his son’s theft."
"""No,"" said (the father). ""You have made up the story; but patience is best; God may bring them back to me. He is all-knowing and all-wise.""",82,12,قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَنِى بِهِمْ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Their father told them that the matter was not as they said with regards to him having stolen. Rather, their souls made deception in this attractive to them, as they had been deceptive about their brother Joseph before. He said my patience is of a beautiful type, which directs complaints to Allah alone. He said that perhaps Allah would return Joseph, his full brother and their oldest brother all together. He, glory be to Him, knew Jacob’s situation and was Wise in the way He arranged everything for him."
"He turned away from them and cried: ""Alas for Joseph!"" And his eyes turned white with grief which he bore in silence.",83,12,وَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰٓأَسَفَىٰ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَٱبْيَضَّتْ عَيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْحُزْنِ فَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"He pulled away, turning from them, saying, ‘O my grief for Joseph!’ The blackness of his eyes had become white out of his great mourning for him, because he was filled with grief and sorrow, yet hiding his grief from the people."
"""By God,"" said they, ""you will never stop thinking of Joseph till you are consumed or perish.""",84,12,قَالُوا۟ تَٱللَّهِ تَفْتَؤُا۟ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ حَتَّىٰ تَكُونَ حَرَضًا أَوْ تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْهَٰلِكِينَ,"The brothers of Joseph said to the father, swearing by Allah, that he would not stop remembering Joseph and grieving over him until he became very ill or actually died."
"He replied: ""I cry my plaint and grief to God, and know from God what you do not know.",85,12,قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَشْكُوا۟ بَثِّى وَحُزْنِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Their father said to them that he only complained to Allah of the grief and sorrow that had occurred him, and that he knew of the kindness and generosity of Allah and His response to those who were in need, and His reward for those who suffered, which they did not know."
"O sons, go in search of Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of the mercy of God. Only they despair of God's mercy who do not believe.""",86,12,يَٰبَنِىَّ ٱذْهَبُوا۟ فَتَحَسَّسُوا۟ مِن يُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ وَلَا تَا۟يْـَٔسُوا۟ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يَا۟يْـَٔسُ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"Their father told them to go and find out news about Joseph and his brother, and not to despair of relief from Allah and His release of His servants. Without doubt, only disbelieving people despair of relief from Allah and His release of His servants, because they do not know the greatness of Allah’s power and His subtle favour upon His servants."
"When they returned to him, they said (to Joseph): ""O Minister, calamity has befallen us and our people. We have brought but a meagre sum, but give us full measure as alms bestowed. God surely rewards those who give alms.""",87,12,فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا ٱلضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَٰعَةٍ مُّزْجَىٰةٍ فَأَوْفِ لَنَا ٱلْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْزِى ٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ,"So they did as their father instructed, and went in search of Joseph and his brother. When they came before Joseph, they said they had experienced hardship and poverty and had brought inferior, cheap goods. They asked him to give them a sufficient measure, as he had given them before, and to be charitable to them by giving them more than this, or overlooking their poor merchandise, saying that Allah rewards those who are charitable with the best of rewards."
", He said: ""Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?""",88,12,قَالَ هَلْ عَلِمْتُم مَّا فَعَلْتُم بِيُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ إِذْ أَنتُمْ جَٰهِلُونَ,"When he heard their words he felt compassion towards them, and let them know who he was, asking them if they knew what they did to Joseph and his full brother when they were ignorant of the consequences of what they did to them."
"They said: ""Surely you are not Joseph!"" ""I am Joseph,"" he said, ""and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us; for God does not verily deprive those who fear Him and are patient of the recompense of those who are good.""",89,12,قَالُوٓا۟ أَءِنَّكَ لَأَنتَ يُوسُفُ قَالَ أَنَا۠ يُوسُفُ وَهَٰذَآ أَخِى قَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّهُۥ مَن يَتَّقِ وَيَصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"They were amazed, and asked whether he was in fact Joseph. Joseph said to them that he was indeed Joseph, and that the person with him was his full brother. Allah had favoured them, saving them from their previous situation, raising them in rank. Whoever is Mindful, following what He instructs and staying away from what He has prohibited, and being patient with hardship, their actions are good, and Allah does not allow the reward of those who do good to be lost; rather, He keeps it in store for them."
"They said: ""By God, God has favoured you above us, for we have indeed been sinners.""",90,12,قَالُوا۟ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ ءَاثَرَكَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَإِن كُنَّا لَخَٰطِـِٔينَ,"The brothers apologised to Joseph for their behaviour towards him, and they said that Allah had indeed preferred him over them through the attributes of perfection He had given to him, and that they had committed evil and disobedience in what they had done to him."
"""There is no blame on you today,"" he said, ""May God forgive you. He is the most merciful of all.",91,12,قَالَ لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَغْفِرُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"Joseph accepted their apology, saying that there would be no blame on them requiring a punishment, nor any criticism, from that day. He asked that Allah forgive them, and He, glory be to Him, is the most Merciful of the merciful."
"Take my shirt and put it on my father's face; his eyesight will be restored; and bring your entire family to me.""",92,12,ٱذْهَبُوا۟ بِقَمِيصِى هَٰذَا فَأَلْقُوهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِ أَبِى يَأْتِ بَصِيرًا وَأْتُونِى بِأَهْلِكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Joseph gave them his shirt when they informed him of what had happened to his father’s eyesight, telling them to take his shirt and to lay it over the face of his father, and that it would return his sight to him. He also told them to bring their whole family to him."
"The caravan departed (from Egypt) and Jacob said (at home): ""Say not that I am in my dotage, but I get the smell of Joseph.""",93,12,وَلَمَّا فَصَلَتِ ٱلْعِيرُ قَالَ أَبُوهُمْ إِنِّى لَأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلَآ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ,"And when the caravan left, departing from Egypt and leaving the inhabited area, Jacob, peace be upon him, said to his people and those with him where he lived, that he could smell the scent of Joseph, although they might say he was foolish and an old senile man who doesn’t know what he says."
"They said: ""By God, you are still persisting in your old delusion.""",94,12,قَالُوا۟ تَٱللَّهِ إِنَّكَ لَفِى ضَلَٰلِكَ ٱلْقَدِيمِ,The people with him swore by Allah that he was still lost in his previous imaginings concerning Joseph’s importance to him and the possibility of seeing him again.
"Then, as the harbinger of happy news arrived and put the garment over his face his eyesight was restored. He said: ""Did I not tell you? I know from God what you do not know.""",95,12,فَلَمَّآ أَن جَآءَ ٱلْبَشِيرُ أَلْقَىٰهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِۦ فَٱرْتَدَّ بَصِيرًا قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ إِنِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"So when the person bearing news came with what would delight Jacob, he lay Joseph’s shirt over his face, and he became able to see again. Then he asked his sons if he had not said to them that he knew about the kindness and grace of Allah in a way that they did not know."
"Said (the sons): ""O our father, pray for us that our sins be forgiven, for we are really sinners.""",96,12,قَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَبَانَا ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا خَٰطِـِٔينَ,"The sons apologised to their father Jacob (peace be upon him) for what they had done to Joseph and his brother, and they asked their father to ask Allah to forgive the sins they had committed in the past, saying that they had been sinners and wrongdoers in what they did to Joseph and his full brother."
"""I will ask my Lord to forgive you,"" he replied, ""for He is forgiving and kind.""",97,12,قَالَ سَوْفَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكُمْ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Their father said to them that he would ask for forgiveness for them from his Lord. Truly, He is Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him, and is Compassionate with them."
"When they went back to Joseph he gave his father and mother a place of honour, and said: ""Enter Egypt in peace by the will of God.""",98,12,فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ ءَاوَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ أَبَوَيْهِ وَقَالَ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ مِصْرَ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ ءَامِنِينَ,"Jacob and his family left their land to travel to Joseph in Egypt. When they came before him he embraced his father and mother, and told his brothers and their family to enter Egypt safely, Allah willing, not experiencing any harm there."
"He seated his parents by his side on the throne; and they fell down before him in homage. ""O my father,"" said Joseph, ""this is the meaning of my earlier dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was gracious in getting me out of the prison, and bringing you out of the desert to me after the discord created by Satan between me and my brothers, for my Lord is gracious to whomsoever He please. He is indeed all-knowing and all-wise.",99,12,وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّوا۟ لَهُۥ سُجَّدًا وَقَالَ يَٰٓأَبَتِ هَٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُءْيَٰىَ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّا وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِىٓ إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِى مِنَ ٱلسِّجْنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُم مِّنَ ٱلْبَدْوِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَن نَّزَغَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِىٓ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"He sat his parents on the throne where he sat, and his parents and eleven brothers honoured him by prostrating to him, which was allowed in their sacred laws. Joseph (peace be upon him) said to his father that this honouring of him by their prostrating to him was the explanation of the dream which he had had before, and which he had told his father. His Lord had made it a reality through this happening. Joseph said his Lord had been kind to him by bringing him out of prison, and bringing them all to him from the desert after Satan had ruined things between him and his brothers; and that His Lord was subtle in planning what He wills to occur, Knowing the situations of His servants, Wise in His planning."
"O my Lord, you have given me dominion and taught me the interpretation of dreams; O Creator of the heavens and the earth, You alone are my saviour in this world and the world to come; let me die submitting to You, and place me among the upright.""",100,12,رَبِّ قَدْ ءَاتَيْتَنِى مِنَ ٱلْمُلْكِ وَعَلَّمْتَنِى مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلْأَحَادِيثِ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَنتَ وَلِىِّۦ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِى مُسْلِمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِى بِٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Then Joseph called upon his Lord, saying that He had given him power in Egypt and had taught him the interpretation of dreams; and that He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, originating them when there was nothing like them, the Protector of all his affairs in the life of this world and the Protector of all of them in the Afterlife. Joseph asked Him to take his soul at the end of his life whilst being in a state of submission to God, and to join him with the righteous prophets from his fathers and others in the highest level of Paradise."
"This is news of the unknown We reveal to you, for you were not present when Joseph's brothers agreed on their course of action, and devised their plot.",101,12,ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ أَجْمَعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَمْكُرُونَ,"Allah revealed all that has been mentioned from the story of Joseph and his brothers to the Messenger (peace be upon him). He had no knowledge of it beforehand, since he was not there with the brothers of Joseph when they agreed to throw him into the bottom of a well, and when they planned their trick; but Allah revealed this all to the Messenger (peace be upon him)."
"Many men will not believe howsoever you wish,",102,12,وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Most people will not have faith, even if the Messenger should make every effort for them to believe; so he should not lose himself in grief over them."
Even though you ask no recompense (for it). It is only a warning for all mankind.,103,12,وَمَا تَسْـَٔلُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"If they used their reason they would believe the Messenger (peace be upon him), because he did not ask any reward for the Qur’ān or for what he called them to. The Qur’ān is only a reminder for all people."
"How many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth which most men pass by and ignore,",104,12,وَكَأَيِّن مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهَا وَهُمْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,"The signs showing that there is only one Allah, glory be to Him, are many, spread out through the heavens and the earth. The disbelievers pass by them, turning away from thinking about them and considering them, not paying attention to them."
"Not only do they not believe in God, but also associate others with Him.",105,12,وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ,"Most people do not admit Allah as the Creator and Provider, Who brings to life and causes death, without also worshipping images and idols next to Him, or claiming that He has a son, glory be to Him!"
"Do they really believe that an all-embracing punishment of God will not come upon them, or the Day of Doom overtake them suddenly while they remain unaware?",106,12,أَفَأَمِنُوٓا۟ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ غَٰشِيَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"Do the idolaters feel safe from a punishment in this world enveloping and overwhelming them, so that they cannot repel it; or from the Hour coming to them suddenly, when they are unaware so that they might prepare for it? Is it because of this that they do not believe?"
"Say: ""My way, and that of my followers, is to call you to God with full perception. All glory to God, I am not an idolater.""",107,12,قُلْ هَٰذِهِۦ سَبِيلِىٓ أَدْعُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا۠ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِى وَسُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Allah tells the Messenger (peace be upon him) to say to those he calls to the truth that this is his way which he calls people to, with insight, as do those who follow him, guided by his guidance and following the Sunnah; and that he is not of those who associate partners with Allah, but worships Allah alone, glory be to Him!"
"All the apostles We had sent before you were men of those regions, to whom We sent Our revelations. Have they not travelled on the earth and seen what befell the people before them? Surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path. Do you not understand?",108,12,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُّوحِىٓ إِلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَدَارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah only sent men, not angels, before the Messenger (peace be upon him), whom He gave revelation as He does to the Messenger, and they were from the people of the towns and not the desert. Their peoples denied them and Allah destroyed them. Do those who deny the Messenger not travel through the earth and think about what the end was of those who denied the truth before them, learning from their example? The bliss in the home of the Afterlife is better for those who are Mindful in this world. Do they not realise that is better, and so become mindful of Allah by following what He instructs (with faith being the most important instruction) and staying away from what He has prohibited (with not associating others with Allah being the most important prohibition)?"
"When the apostles despaired and thought they were made false promises, Our help arrived, and We delivered whom We pleased; but never will Our punishment be averted from the sinners.",109,12,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا ٱسْتَيْـَٔسَ ٱلرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُوا۟ جَآءَهُمْ نَصْرُنَا فَنُجِّىَ مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُنَا عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Allah gave time to the enemies of these messengers He sent, not being quick to punish, but luring them gradually until when their destruction was overdue, and the messengers despaired of it and the disbelievers thought that their messengers had lied to them in their promises of a punishment for those who deny the truth and the rescue of those who have faith; then Allah’s help came to His messengers, saving the messengers and believers from the destruction which the disbelievers suffered, and Allah’s punishment cannot be turned away from the sinners when He sends it down."
"Verily in their accounts is a lesson for men of wisdom. This is not a fictitious tale, but a verification of earlier Books, and a clear exposition of everything, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.",110,12,لَقَدْ كَانَ فِى قَصَصِهِمْ عِبْرَةٌ لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ مَا كَانَ حَدِيثًا يُفْتَرَىٰ وَلَٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ ٱلَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"In the stories of the messengers and their peoples, as in the story of Joseph and his brothers, are lessons to be learnt by those of sound mind. The Qur’ān, which contains such narrations, is not words which are made up and fabricated about Allah, but a confirmation of the divine scriptures revealed from Allah and a detailed explanation of everything that needs explaining through sacred laws; and guidance to all that is good, and a mercy for those who have faith in it, because it is they who benefit from what is in it."
ALIF LAM MIM RA. These are the verses of the Scripture. Whatsoever is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most men do not believe.,0,13,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓر تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"1. We have spoken about similar phrases at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah. These sublime verses in this Sūrah, and the Qur’ān that God has revealed to you - O Messenger - is the truth in which there is no uncertainty. There is no doubt that it is from God, but most people do not believe in it due to stubbornness and pride."
"It is God who raised the skies without support, as you can see, then assumed His throne, and enthralled the sun and the moon (so that) each runs to a predetermined course. He disposes all affairs, distinctly explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.",1,13,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى رَفَعَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى يُدَبِّرُ ٱلْأَمْرَ يُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُم بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ,"2.Allah is the One Who made the heavens high without any supports that you can see. Then He established Himself on the Throne and He subjugated the sun and the moon for the benefit of His creation. Both the sun and the moon run along for a specified period of time that is known only to Allah. He, may He be glorified, disposes of all matters in the heavens and the earth as He wills. He explains the signs that indicate His Power in the hope that you may be certain about meeting your Lord on the Day of Judgement and prepare for it by doing good actions."
It is He who stretched the earth and placed upon it stabilisers and rivers; and made two of a pair of every fruit; (and) He covers up the day with the night. In these are signs for those who reflect.,2,13,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَدَّ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ وَأَنْهَٰرًا وَمِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ جَعَلَ فِيهَا زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ يُغْشِى ٱلَّيْلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"3He, may He be glorified, is the One Who spread out the earth and created on it firm mountains so that it does not cause the people to become unsettled. From all types of fruit He made two kinds, like the male and female in animals. He draws the veil of night over the day so that it becomes dark after being bright. In that which is mentioned, there are signs and proof for a people who reflect and ponder over Allah’s creation, for they are the ones who benefit from such signs and proof."
"On the earth are tracts adjoining one another, and vineyards, fields of corn and date-palm trees, some forked, some with single trunks, yet all irrigated by the self-same water, though We make some more excellent than the others in fruit. There are surely signs in them for those who understand.",3,13,وَفِى ٱلْأَرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَٰوِرَٰتٌ وَجَنَّٰتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَٰبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَانٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ يُسْقَىٰ بِمَآءٍ وَٰحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِى ٱلْأُكُلِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"On Earth there are neighbouring plots, gardens of vineyards, crops, palm trees sharing one root and others with individual roots. All of these gardens and crops are watered with the same water, I make some of them better than others in taste and other benefits despite their being next to one another and being watered with the same water, there are signs and proof for those who reason, for they are the ones who pay heed to it."
"If you are surprised, then astonishing is the speech (of those who say:) ""Having turned to dust shall we be raised as a new creation?"" They are the ones who deny their Lord, and they will have collars around their necks. They are the inmates of Hell, where they will abide for ever.",4,13,وَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَٰبًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلْأَغْلَٰلُ فِىٓ أَعْنَاقِهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"If you are amazed, O Messenger, at anything, then you should surely be amazed at their denial of resurrection and their statement of proof for their denial: What, when we die and become dust and decayed and decomposed bones, shall we be resurrected and restored to life? Those who reject the resurrection after death are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord and as a result they disbelieved in His Power to resurrect the dead. They are the ones around whose necks chains of fire will be placed on the Day of Judgement. They will be the inhabitants of the Fire and they will remain there forever, without ever ceasing to exist and without their punishment coming to an end."
"They want you to hasten the evil before the good, even when there have been examples of retribution before them. Though certainly your Lord forgives human beings for their iniquities, your Lord is severe of retribution.",5,13,وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ ٱلْمَثُلَٰتُ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"The idolaters ask you, O Messenger, to bring on the punishment and they enquire as to why it is taking so long to come on them before they completely enjoy the favours that Allah has decreed for them. Many such punishments have come before on people like them from the nations who disbelieved. Why do they not take a lesson from them? Your Lord, O Messenger, is one who pardons people despite their wrongdoing. He, therefore, does not rush to take retribution from them giving them a chance to repent to Allah. He is truly severe in punishing those who persist in their denial if they do not repent."
"The unbelievers say: ""Why no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord?"" But you are only a bearer of warnings, and a guide for every nation.",6,13,وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦٓ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah - persisting in their rejection and obstinance - say: Why has no sign been sent down to Muhammad from his Lord, just as was sent down to Moses and Jesus? You, O Messenger, are only a warner who warns people of Allah’s punishment. You only have signs that Allah has given you. Every community has a prophet who shows them and guides them to the path of truth."
"God is cognisant of what every female carries in her womb, or what the wombs want or exceed (of their disburdening time). With Him all things are in determined measure.",7,13,ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَىٰ وَمَا تَغِيضُ ٱلْأَرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُۥ بِمِقْدَارٍ,"Allah knows what every female bears in her womb. He knows everything about it. He knows about any shrinking, swelling, health or illness that occurs in the womb. By Him, may He be glorified, everything is determined with a measure that will neither decrease nor increase."
"He is the knower of the known and the unknown, the mighty and most high.",8,13,عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ ٱلْكَبِيرُ ٱلْمُتَعَالِ,"This is because He, may He be glorified, knows about everything that is not perceived by His creation as well as everything that is perceived by them. He is the Majestic in His attributes, names and actions. The Supreme over every creation of His in His self and attributes."
"He who keeps his secret among you is the same to Him as he who speaks out publicly, and he who hides himself in the night and walks freely in the day.",9,13,سَوَآءٌ مِّنكُم مَّنْ أَسَرَّ ٱلْقَوْلَ وَمَن جَهَرَ بِهِۦ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍۭ بِٱلَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌۢ بِٱلنَّهَارِ,"He knows what is secret and what is even more hidden. Whether you, O people, hide your statements or proclaim them, it is the same in His knowledge. A person who hides from the eyes of people under the darkness of the night and the one who acts openly in the light of day, are equally known by Him."
"His angels keep watch over him in succession (night and day), in front and behind, by God's command. Verily God does not change the state of a people till they change themselves. When God intends misfortune for a people no one can avert it, and no saviour will they have apart from Him.",10,13,لَهُۥ مُعَقِّبَٰتٌ مِّنۢ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِۦ يَحْفَظُونَهُۥ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُوا۟ مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَإِذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوٓءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُۥ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ مِن وَالٍ,"He, may He be glorified, has angels that come upon a person one after the other. Some of them come at night and some during the day. They protect the person by Allah’s command and they record his statements and actions. Allah does not change the good condition of a people for the worse unless they change the state of gratitude within themselves. When Allah, may He be glorified, wills destruction for a people, then no one can ward off what He wills. You, O people, do not have any one apart from Him who will take charge of your affairs and to whom you can resort to ward off the calamity that afflicts you."
"It is He who makes the lightning flash for fear and hope, and raises massive clouds.",11,13,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُرِيكُمُ ٱلْبَرْقَ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا وَيُنشِئُ ٱلسَّحَابَ ٱلثِّقَالَ,"It is He who shows you, O people, the lightning, inspiring in you both fear of the lightning bolts and hope of rain. It is He who forms the clouds laden with rain water."
"The thunder sings His praises, and the angels too, for awe of Him. He sends thunder-bolts and strikes whosoever He will with them: Even then it is God they contend about! But mighty is He in (His) power.",12,13,وَيُسَبِّحُ ٱلرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِۦ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُمْ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْمِحَالِ,"The thunder pronounces His glory together with His praises, may He be glorified. The angels pronounce the glory of their Lord in awe of Him and out of respect and honour for Him. He sends thunderbolts to strike and eliminate whichever of His creation He wills. Yet the disbelievers still dispute about Allah’s Oneness. Allah is mighty in power and strength and severe in punishing those who go against Him."
"To call on Him is true (supplication). For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all, except like a man who stretches his hands towards the water that it reach his mouth, but it will never reach it. Not more than error are the prayers of infidels.",13,13,لَهُۥ دَعْوَةُ ٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَىْءٍ إِلَّا كَبَٰسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ إِلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُغَ فَاهُ وَمَا هُوَ بِبَٰلِغِهِۦ وَمَا دُعَآءُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ,"The call of monotheism is for Allah alone and no one shares this with Him. The idols on whom the idolaters call besides Him do not respond to the call of those who call them in any matter. Their calling them is simply like a thirsty person stretching his hand towards water for it to reach his mouth so that he can drink from it. The water is not going to reach his mouth. The call of the disbelievers to their idols is only in vain and far from being right, because they have no power to draw any benefit for them nor ward off any harm from them."
"Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth bows to God in submission with a will or perforce, as do their shadows in the morning and evening.",14,13,وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَظِلَٰلُهُم بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلْءَاصَالِ,"All that are in the heavens and on earth submit themselves in prostration to Allah alone. A believer and disbeliever are equal in this, except that a believer submits and prostrates to Him willingly, while a disbeliever unwillingly submits even though his natural disposition dictates that he should do so willingly. The shadow of every creation that has a shadow submits to Him at the beginning and at the end of the day."
"Ask them: ""Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?"" (They will) say: ""God."" Say: ""Then why do you take protectors besides Him who have no power over their own gain or loss?"" Say: ""Can a blind man and one who can see be equal? Or, darkness and light be the same? Or, have those they have appointed equal of God created, as He has created, so that the (two) creations look alike to them?"" Say: ""God is the creator of everything. He is One, the omnipotent.""",15,13,قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَٱتَّخَذْتُم مِّن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ لِأَنفُسِهِمْ نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى ٱلظُّلُمَٰتُ وَٱلنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُوا۟ كَخَلْقِهِۦ فَتَشَٰبَهَ ٱلْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْوَٰحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّٰرُ,"Say, O Messenger, to the disbelievers who worship others together with Allah: Who is the creator and the controller of the heavens and the earth? Say, O Messenger, It is Allah who is their Creator and Controller and you acknowledge this. Say, O Messenger, to them: Have you taken for yourselves protectors other than Allah who are themselves helpless! They cannot draw any benefit for themselves nor remove any harm. How then will they be able to do so for others? Say to them, O Messenger, Is the disbeliever, who has no insight, equal to the believer who can see and who is guided? And is disbelief, which is layers of darkness, equal to faith, which is light? Have they assigned in the creation partners to Allah, may He be glorified, who have created anything like Allah’s creation so that their creation is indistinguishable from His? Say to them, O Messenger, Allah alone is the Creator of all things. He has no partner in creation. He is the One and Only deity, who solely deserves to be worshipped, and He is the All Compelling."
"He sends down water from the skies, which flows in channels according to their capacity, with the scum borne on the surface of the torrent, as rises the scum when metals are heated on the fire for making ornaments and household utensils. This is how God determines truth and falsehood. The scum disappears like the foam on the bank, and that which is useful to man remains on the earth. That is how God sets forth precepts of wisdom.",16,13,أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌۢ بِقَدَرِهَا فَٱحْتَمَلَ ٱلسَّيْلُ زَبَدًا رَّابِيًا وَمِمَّا يُوقِدُونَ عَلَيْهِ فِى ٱلنَّارِ ٱبْتِغَآءَ حِلْيَةٍ أَوْ مَتَٰعٍ زَبَدٌ مِّثْلُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَٱلْبَٰطِلَ فَأَمَّا ٱلزَّبَدُ فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً وَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ كَذَٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْأَمْثَالَ,"Allah strikes an example of the erosion of falsehood and the survival of truth with rainwater that comes down from the sky and causes riverbeds to flow, each according to its size, whether big or small. The overflowing water carries on its surface scum and froth that rise above the water. He then gives another example of falsehood and truth with some of the metals that people put into a furnace in order to melt down and to make ornaments for people. Falsehood is like the scum and froth that floats above the water and like the slag expelled by smelting the metal. Truth is like the pure water that can be drunk and that causes fruits, grass and vegetation to grow; and like the metal that remains after smelting, which is of benefit to people. Just as Allah has given these two examples, He gives many examples to people so that truth may be distinguished from falsehood."
"For those who obey their Lord is excellence. For those who fail to obey, the reckoning will be hard, even if they possess and give as ransom all that there is on the earth, and as much more; and Hell will be their abode: How wretched is its wide expanse!",17,13,لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُوا۟ لِرَبِّهِمُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَهُۥ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُۥ مَعَهُۥ لَٱفْتَدَوْا۟ بِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ سُوٓءُ ٱلْحِسَابِ وَمَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,"Those believers who responded to their Lord when he called them towards His Oneness and obedience will have the best reward, which is Paradise. But those disbelievers who did not respond to His call towards His Oneness and obedience, even if they possessed all the different types of wealth on earth, and twice as much, they would offer all of that to redeem themselves from the punishment. Those who did not respond to His call will be taken to account for all their wrong deeds and the home in which they will reside will be Hell— What a miserable place the Fire is to rest and settle in!"
"Can a man who knows what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and one who cannot see, be the same? They alone take warning who are wise,",18,13,أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ ٱلْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَىٰٓ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"The one who knows that what Allah has revealed to you, O Messenger, is undoubtedly the Truth from your Lord, and who has faith in and responds to Allah, cannot be equal to someone who is blind, who disbelieves in Allah and does not respond to Him. Only those with sound understanding will pay heed to and take a lesson from this."
"Who fulfil their covenant with God and do not break their agreement,",19,13,ٱلَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَا يَنقُضُونَ ٱلْمِيثَٰقَ,Those who respond to Allah are the ones who fulfil the pledges they made to Allah or the pledges they made to His servants and who do not break the pledges made with Allah or with others.
"Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,",20,13,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦٓ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوٓءَ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"They are those who join everything that Allah commands to be joined, such as ties with family and their fellow brothers for the sake of Allah, who are in such awe of their Lord that it moves them to carry out His instructions and refrain from His prohibitions, and who fear that Allah will take them to account for every sin they commit, for any person whose account is scrutinised will be ruined."
"Who persevere in seeking the way of their Lord, who fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend of what We have given them, secretly or openly, who repel evil with good: For them is the recompense of Paradise:",21,13,وَٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأَنفَقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً وَيَدْرَءُونَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عُقْبَى ٱلدَّارِ,"They are those who remained steadfast in following Allah and in the ease and hardship that Allah decreed for them, and they remained firm in refraining from going against Him, seeking Allah’s pleasure. They kept up the prayer perfectly, they discharged their obligations from the wealth that We gave them, and they willingly gave from that wealth, secretly to avoid ostentation, and openly so that others could follow their lead. They repel the evil of those who harm them by doing good to them. These people who have these qualities will have a praiseworthy outcome on the Day of Judgement."
"Perpetual gardens which they will enter with those of their fathers, spouses and children who were virtuous and at peace, with angels coming in through every door",22,13,جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا وَمَن صَلَحَ مِنْ ءَابَآئِهِمْ وَأَزْوَٰجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّٰتِهِمْ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ,"This praiseworthy outcome refers to gardens in which they will permanently reside in luxury. To complete the favour, those of their fathers, mothers, wives and children who were upright will enter these gardens together with them so as to make their stay even more enjoyable by meeting them. In addition, the angels will come in to visit and congratulate them from every door of their homes in Paradise."
"Saying: ""(Welcome,) peace on you, for you persevered."" How excellent the recompense of Paradise!",23,13,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُم بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى ٱلدَّارِ,"The angels will greet them whenever they come to visit them saying: Peace be on you, i.e.: You are safe from calamities because of your being steadfast in following Allah and in difficult times and being firm in not going against Him. What a wonderful final home is your outcome!"
"As for those who break God's covenant after validating it, and sever relations which God ordained cohered, and spread corruption in the land, there is condemnation for them and an evil abode.",24,13,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مِيثَٰقِهِۦ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦٓ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوٓءُ ٱلدَّارِ,"As for those who break their pledge with Allah after it has been made binding, and cut off the relationships that Allah has commanded to be joined, those are the unfortunate and wretched ones who will be distanced from Allah’s mercy, and they will have a dreadful home in the Fire."
"God increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever He will, and they rejoice in the life of this world. Yet the life of this world is nothing but a merchandise as compared to the life of the next.",25,13,ٱللَّهُ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ وَفَرِحُوا۟ بِٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَٰعٌ,"Allah expands provision for anyone He wills and restricts it for any of His servants that He wills. Being given abundant provision is not a sign of being fortunate or of having attained Allah’s love. Similarly, restriction of provision is not a sign of being wretched. The disbelievers rejoiced in the life of this world and inclined to it becoming comfortable therein. Yet the life of this world, compared to the Hearafter, is only a brief enjoyment that will soon pass."
"The unbelievers say: ""How is it that no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord?"" Say: ""God leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whoever turns to Him in repentance.",26,13,وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِىٓ إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah and His verses say: If only a physical sign was sent down to Muhammad from his Lord proving his truthfulness and then we will believe. Say, O Messenger, to those who suggest this: Allah, through His justice, leaves whoever He will to stray, and through His grace He guides to Himself those who turn towards Him in repentance. Guidance is not in their hands so that they could link it to the sending down of signs."
"Those who believe and find peace in their hearts from the contemplation of God: Surely there is peace of heart in the contemplation of God!""",27,13,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ ٱلْقُلُوبُ,These people whom Allah guides are those who have faith and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah and in His glorification and praise and by reciting and listening to His book. Truly it is only natural that in the remembrance of Allah hearts find comfort.
"Those who believe and do the right, have happiness, and an excellent resting place.",28,13,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ طُوبَىٰ لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَـَٔابٍ,"These people who have faith in Allah and do good actions that bring them close to Allah, will have a pleasant life in the afterlife and will have a beautiful outcome in Paradise."
"That is how We have sent you to a people before whom many a people have come and gone, so that you may announce to them whatever We have revealed to you. But they do not believe in Ar-Rahman. Tell them: ""He is my Lord. There is no other god but He. In Him have I placed my trust, and to Him is my reversion.""",29,13,كَذَٰلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ فِىٓ أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَآ أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَا۟ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّى لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ,"Just as we sent previous messengers to their communities, We sent you, O Messenger, to your community so that you may recite to them the Qur’ān that We revealed to you, for it is sufficient evidence of your truthfulness. Yet the condition of your people is that they reject this miracle because they deny the Benevolent One as they associate others with Him as partners. Say, O Messenger, :  The Benevolent One, with whom you associate others as partners, He is my Lord; there is no one deserving of being worshipped but He; in Him I put my trust for all my affairs, and to Him I turn in repentance."
"Had there been a Qur'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God. Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind? As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass. Surely God does not go back on His promise.",30,13,وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْءَانًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ ٱلْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بَل لِّلَّهِ ٱلْأَمْرُ جَمِيعًا أَفَلَمْ يَا۟يْـَٔسِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ لَهَدَى ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَلَا يَزَالُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُوا۟ قَارِعَةٌ أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِىَ وَعْدُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"If any of the divine scriptures had the quality of being able to make the mountains move from their places or the earth split and turn into rivers and springs, or be recited to the dead who would then come to life, it would have been this Qur’ān that is revealed to you, O Messenger, for its evidence is clear and its effect is profound, if only their hearts were mindful - but they reject it. Instead, the matter of sending down miracles and other matters are entirely in Allah’s control. Do those who have faith in Allah not know that if Allah willed to guide all the people together without sending down any miracles He would have done so? But He did not will that. Those who reject Allah continue to be struck with a severe disaster that shakes them, or such disaster falls close to their homes until Allah’s promise of the continuous punishment comes to pass. Allah does not fail to accomplish what He promised when the time specified for it comes."
"Many an apostle have they mocked before you; but I allowed the unbelievers respite, then I seized them. How severe was My punishment then!",31,13,وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَمْلَيْتُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ,"You are not the first messenger to be rejected and mocked at by his people. The communities before you, O Messenger, mocked at their messengers and rejected them. But I gave respite to those who rejected their messengers until they thought I would not destroy them. Then I seized them after that respite, with various forms of punishment. What do you think of My punishment of them? It was really a severe punishment!"
"Who is it who stands (watch) over every soul for what it does? Yet they ascribe compeers to God. Say: ""Then name them. Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth? Or is it only empty talk? In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path. Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.",32,13,أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَآئِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَجَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ قُلْ سَمُّوهُمْ أَمْ تُنَبِّـُٔونَهُۥ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَم بِظَٰهِرٍ مِّنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ بَلْ زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مَكْرُهُمْ وَصُدُّوا۟ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْ هَادٍ,"Is the One who watches over the actions of every soul and who recompenses it for its actions more deserving of being worshipped, or these idols who do not have any right to be worshipped? Yet the disbelievers have unjustly and falsely made them partners to Allah. Say to them, O Messenger, : Tell us the names of the partners that you worship together with Allah if you are true in your claim. Or is it that you are informing Allah of partners on earth that He does not know of? Or are you informing Him with a show of words that have no reality? Rather, Satan has made the evil designs of the disbelievers seem good to them. Thus they rejected Allah and He turned them away from the path of righteousness and guidance."
For them is punishment in this world; and the punishment of the world to come is far more severe. They will have no one to save them from God.,33,13,لَّهُمْ عَذَابٌ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَشَقُّ وَمَا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ,"There is a punishment for them in this world in the form of being killed and imprisoned at the hands of the believers, but the punishment of the Hereafter that awaits them will be more severe and more difficult than the punishment of this world because of its never-ending severity and continuity. They will have no one to protect them from Allah’s punishment on the Day of Judgement."
"The likeness of Paradise promised the pious and devout is (of a garden) with streams of rippling water, everlasting fruits and shade. This is the recompense of those who keep away from evil; but the recompense of those who deny the truth is Hell.",34,13,مَّثَلُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِى وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ أُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وَظِلُّهَا تِلْكَ عُقْبَى ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّعُقْبَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ ٱلنَّارُ,"The description of Paradise that those mindful of Allah, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, have been promised is that rivers flow below its palaces, its fruits are perpetual and do not ever end unlike the fruit of the world, and its shade is everlasting without ever retracting. That is the outcome that awaits those who are mindful of Allah, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions. The outcome of the disbelievers is the Fire, which they will enter to remain there forever."
"Those to whom We have given the Scriptures rejoice in what We have sent down to you; but some of their factions reject some of it. Tell them: ""I am commanded to worship only God, and not to associate compeers with Him. To Him I call you, and to Him is the destination.""",35,13,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنَ ٱلْأَحْزَابِ مَن يُنكِرُ بَعْضَهُۥ قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ وَلَآ أُشْرِكَ بِهِۦٓ إِلَيْهِ أَدْعُوا۟ وَإِلَيْهِ مَـَٔابِ,"Those Jews to whom We gave the Torah and those Christians to whom We gave the Gospel, rejoice in what has been revealed to you, O Messenger, because it conforms to some of what was revealed to them. Some factions of the Jews and Christians deny parts of what has been revealed to you because it does not conform to their desires, or it describes them as having altered or distorted their religion. Say to them, O Messenger, Allah has only instructed me to worship Him alone, and not to associate any partners with Him. To Him alone I invite and not to anyone else. To Him alone is my return. This is what the Torah and the Gospel taught."
"That is how We have sent down this (Qur'an) as a code of clear judgement. But if you follow their caprices, now that you have been given knowledge, you will have no friend or protector against God.",36,13,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ حُكْمًا عَرَبِيًّا وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم بَعْدَمَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا وَاقٍ,"Just as We sent down the previous scriptures in the language of their people, We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’ān as a decisive word indicating the truth in the Arabic language. If you, O Messenger, follow the desires of the People of the Scripture, in their request to you to delete what does not conform to their desires, after you have received the knowledge that Allah has taught you, then you will not have anyone to take charge of your affairs and to assist you against your enemies and you will not have anyone to protect you from Allah’s punishment."
"We sent many apostles before you, and bestowed on them wives and children, but it was not for any apostle to come up with a miracle unless by the leave of God. For every age there is a law.",37,13,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَذُرِّيَّةً وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِـَٔايَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ,"We sent messengers before you, O Messenger, who were human - so you are nothing new among the messengers. We gave them wives and children like other human beings. We did not make them angels who do not marry and have children. You are one of these messengers who marry and have children. Why then are these idolaters surprised at this? No messenger can bring a miracle except if Allah gives permission for him to do so. For every matter decreed by Allah there is a Book in which it is mentioned and a time which will neither come too early nor too late."
"God abrogates or confirms whatsoever He will, for He has with Him the Book of Books.",38,13,يَمْحُوا۟ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُۥٓ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ,"Allah removes whatever good, evil, fortune or misfortune He wills to remove and He confirms whatever He wills. With Him is the Preserved Tablet, which is the source of all of that, and any erasure or confirmation that appears conforms to what is in it."
"Whether We allow you to see (the punishment) We have promised them, or end your life before (its execution), it is certainly for you to convey the message; the reckoning is for Us to do.",39,13,وَإِن مَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَعَلَيْنَا ٱلْحِسَابُ,"If I show you, O Prophet, some of the punishment that We promise them before your death, then that is My choice. If I cause you to die before showing you that, then your duty is only to convey what We have instructed you to convey. It is not your duty to recompense them or to take them to account - that is My duty."
Do they not see Us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers? It is for God to judge; and there is none to reverse His judgement. He is swift at reckoning.,40,13,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا نَأْتِى ٱلْأَرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا وَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ لَا مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِۦ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Have these disbelievers not seen that We come to the land of the disbelievers diminishing it from its borders by spreading Islam and by the Muslims conquering it? Allah decides and decrees whatever He wills amongst His servants. No one can reverse, amend or alter His decision. He, may He be glorified, is swift in reckoning and He will take the earlier people and the later ones to account within one day."
"Surely those who had gone before them had also plotted; but God's is all the planning, for He has knowledge of what each does. The unbelievers will soon learn for whom is the guerdon of Paradise.",41,13,وَقَدْ مَكَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَكْرُ جَمِيعًا يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ وَسَيَعْلَمُ ٱلْكُفَّٰرُ لِمَنْ عُقْبَى ٱلدَّارِ,"The previous communities had plotted and devised schemes against their prophets and they rejected what they brought to them. What did they manage to do by such schemes? Nothing! This is because the effective plan is only that of Allah and no other. He, may He be glorified, is the One Who knows what their souls earn and He will recompense them for it. Then they will know how wrong they were in not having faith in Allah, and how right the believers were as they would have acquired Paradise and the best outcome."
"Yet those who are disbelievers say: ""You are not the apostle sent (by God)."" Tell them: ""God is sufficient as witness between me and you, and he who has knowledge of the Book.""",42,13,وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَسْتَ مُرْسَلًا قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًۢا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَمَنْ عِندَهُۥ عِلْمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah say: You, O Muhammad, have not been sent by Allah. Tell them, O Messenger, Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you to the fact that I have been sent from my Lord to you, as well as those who have knowledge of the heavenly scriptures that contain my description. The one for whom Allah is a witness to His truthfulness, is not harmed by the rejection of those who deny him."
"ALIF LAM RA. A Book We have sent down to you that you may lead men out of darkness into light, by their Lord's command, to the path of the mighty, the worthy of praise.",0,14,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓر كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ ٱلنَّاسَ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,"Alif Lam Ra, this is a book which I have revealed to you, so that you may lead people out of darkness and into light, by the will of their Lord, to the path of the Almighty, the PraiseworthyThe discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.This Qur’ān is a book that I revealed to you, O Messenger, so that you may remove people from disbelief, ignorance and misguidance to faith, knowledge and guidance - to the religion of Islam which is the way of Allah, the Mighty whom no one can overpower, the One Who deserves praise in everything."
"God, to whom belongs all there is in the heavens and the earth. Woe to the unbelievers for the terrible punishment (that awaits).",1,14,ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ,"Allah, to Whom alone belongs whatever is in the heavens, and to Whom alone belongs whatever is on earth. He alone is the One Who deserves to be worshipped and that nothing of His creation be associated as partner to Him. Those who disbelieved in Allah will received a severe punishment."
"Those who hold the life of this world dearer than that of the next, who obstruct the path of God and seek obliquity in it, have wandered far into error.",2,14,ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَحِبُّونَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا عَلَى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah prefer the life of the world and its transient pleasures over the afterlife with its eternal bliss. They turn people away from Allah’s path and they seek to distort His path, make it divert from the truth and move away from uprightness, so that no one treads it. Those described with such attributes are in error that is far from the truth and righteousness."
"We never sent a messenger who did not speak the tongue of his people, that he may explain to them distinctly. God leads whosoever He wills astray, and shows whoever He wills the way: He is all-mighty and all-wise.",3,14,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا بِلِسَانِ قَوْمِهِۦ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَهُمْ فَيُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"We did not send any messenger except that We sent him speaking the language of his people, so that they could easily understand what he brought from Allah. We did not send him to compel them to have faith in Allah, for Allah misguides whoever He wills out of His justice, and guides whoever He wills through His grace. He is the Mighty, whom no one can overpower, and the Wise in His creation and planning."
"Remember when We sent Moses with Our signs (We said): ""Bring your people out of darkness into light, and remind them of the visitations of God. Indeed there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful soul""",4,14,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أَنْ أَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَذَكِّرْهُم بِأَيَّىٰمِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,"We had sent Moses and supported him with miracles indicating his truthfulness and that he was indeed sent by His Lord. We instructed him to remove his people from disbelief, ignorance and slavery to faith, knowledge and freedom from the enslavement of Pharaoh and his people. We instructed him to remind them of Allah’s days on which He blessed them with His favours and of the days of His retribution on which He took the deniers to task. In those days there are clear signs of Allah’s Oneness, His magnitude of power, His favour to the believers and His punishment of the wrongdoing deniers. This is something that will be of benefit to those who are steadfast in following Allah and who constantly show gratitude for His favours and blessings."
"So Moses said to his people: ""Remember the favours of God when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who afflicted you with oppression, slaying your sons but keeping alive your women, which was a great trial from your Lord.""",5,14,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ أَنجَىٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Moses fulfilled the instruction of his Lord and said to his people, the Israelites, reminding them of Allah’s favours to them: O my people, remember Allah’s favour on you when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh and gave you safety from their affliction. They were making you suffer greatly, killing your sons, so that no one would be born amongst you to take over Pharaoh’s kingdom, and letting your women live to humiliate and disgrace them. In their doing so was a great test of patience for you. Allah then rewarded you for your patience in this trial by saving you from the affliction of the people of Pharaoh."
"Remember, your Lord proclaimed: ""I shall give you more if you are grateful; but if you are thankless then surely My punishment is very great.""",6,14,وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِى لَشَدِيدٌ,"Moses said to them: Remember when your Lord clearly announced to you: If you are grateful to Allah for the above-mentioned favours that He has blessed you with, then He will give you more from His favour and grace. But, if you deny His favours to you and do not show gratitude for them, His punishment is severe for those who deny His favours and are not grateful for them."
"And Moses said: ""What if you and all the people of the world deny, God is unconcerned and worthy of praise.""",7,14,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰٓ إِن تَكْفُرُوٓا۟ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ,"Moses said to his people: O my people, if you yourselves reject the truth and together with you all those on earth also reject the truth, the harm of your rejection will be on you, for Allah is self-sufficient and deserving of praise by Himself. The faith of the believers does not benefit Him and the rejection of the disbelievers does not harm Him."
"Has not the news of those before you, the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, and those who came after them, come to you? None knows (about) them except God. Their apostles came to them with clear proofs, but they tried to silence them and said: ""We do not believe in what you have been sent with, and we are in doubt of what you call us to, about which we are in disquiet.'",8,14,أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَؤُا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَرَدُّوٓا۟ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِىٓ أَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِۦ وَإِنَّا لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَنَآ إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ,"Has not the news of the destruction of the communities who disbelieved before you reached you, O disbelievers? The people of Noah, the Ad, the people of Hud, Thamud - the people of Salih - and the communities that came after them, which are so numerous that their full number is known only to Allah? Their messengers came to them with clear signs as well as miracles. But they did not respond to their messengers and did not believe them. They did not utter anything that indicated their faith. Instead they said to their messengers: We reject what you have been sent with. We have disturbing doubts about what you are calling us to."
"Said their apostles: ""Can there be doubt about God, the originator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you to forgive some of your sins, and give you respite for a time ordained."" They said: ""You are only men like us, and yet you wish to turn us away from what our fathers worshipped. Bring to us then a clear proof.""",9,14,قَالَتْ رُسُلُهُمْ أَفِى ٱللَّهِ شَكٌّ فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُم مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُؤَخِّرَكُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى قَالُوٓا۟ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَصُدُّونَا عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُنَا فَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Their messengers said in response to them: Can there be any doubt about Allah’s Oneness and about worshipping Him alone, when He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who brought them into existence without any precedent?! He calls you to have faith in Him so that He can wipe out your previous sins and defer you until such time that you can complete your fixed period of life in this world. Their people said to them: You are only human like us. You have no merit over us. You want to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship. Bring us clear proof indicating the truthfulness of your claim that you are messengers from Allah to us."
"Their apostles said to them: ""Indeed we are men like you, but God bestows His favours on whomsoever He wills among His creatures. It is not in our power to bring a miracle for you without the leave of God. The believers should only place their trust in God.",10,14,قَالَتْ لَهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ إِن نَّحْنُ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَمُنُّ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَمَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نَّأْتِيَكُم بِسُلْطَٰنٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"In response to them, their messengers said: We are people like you, so we are not blaming you for imitating your forefathers in that respect. Just because you are people, it does not mean that you should imitate them in everything. Amongst His servants, Allah bestows unique favors on whomever He wishes, so He will choose some to be messengers to mankind. It is forbidden for us to grant you whatever evidence you desire, except if Allah so chooses. It is not within our power to bring you such evidence; instead, Allah alone is the One capable of doing so. Those who entrust all of their affairs to Allah will have trust in Him."
"And why should we not repose our trust in God when He has shown us our paths of duty to Him? We shall bear with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon us. The trusting place their trust in God.""",11,14,وَمَا لَنَآ أَلَّا نَتَوَكَّلَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَىٰنَا سُبُلَنَا وَلَنَصْبِرَنَّ عَلَىٰ مَآ ءَاذَيْتُمُونَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,What sort of objection or excuse would cause us to cease having trust in Him? He has guided us to the clearest and most upright path. We will be patient against the harm you caused to us by belying and mocking us. Those who put their trust in Allah will entrust all of their affairs to Him alone.
"The unbelievers said to their apostles: ""We shall drive you out of our land, or else you come back to our fold."" Their Lord then communicated to them: ""We shall annihilate these wicked people,",12,14,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِرُسُلِهِمْ لَنُخْرِجَنَّكُم مِّنْ أَرْضِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِى مِلَّتِنَا فَأَوْحَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"When those who disbelieved in Allah, from amongst the people to whom the messengers were sent, were unable to respond to the messengers’ arguments, they said: “We will drive you out from our town, or you will have to reject your religion and return to ours.” Allah then sent revelation to His messengers, as a way to strengthen them: “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers who disbelieved in Allah and His messengers.”"
"And establish you in their place. This is for him who fears My station, and dreads My commination.""",13,14,وَلَنُسْكِنَنَّكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ,"O messengers, we will cause you to dwell on the earth after their destruction. What has been mentioned of the destruction of the denying disbelievers and causing their believing messengers to dwell on the earth after the disbelievers’ destruction is for whoever reflects on My majesty and observance of it, as well as for who feared My warning to him of the punishment."
"Then (the apostles) asked of God's assistance, and every arrogant tyrant was frustrated:",14,14,وَٱسْتَفْتَحُوا۟ وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ,"The messengers asked Allah to make them victorious over their enemies. Every person who is arrogant and stubborn towards the truth, who does not follow it despite it being apparent to him, is a loser."
"Before him is Hell, and he will get putrid liquid to drink.",15,14,مِّن وَرَآئِهِۦ جَهَنَّمُ وَيُسْقَىٰ مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ,"Hellfire is in front of this arrogant person, awaiting him. He will be given the puss that oozes from the people of Hellfire to drink, but it will not quench his thirst. He will continue to be punished with thirst and other types of punishments."
"He will sip it, yet will not be able to gulp it down. Death will crowd in upon him from every side, but die he will not. A terrible torment trails him.",16,14,يَتَجَرَّعُهُۥ وَلَا يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُۥ وَيَأْتِيهِ ٱلْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ وَمِن وَرَآئِهِۦ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ,"He will continue to sip it over and over because of the severity of its bitterness, its heat, and its rottenness. But he will not be able to swallow it. He will then be overcome by death from every direction due to the severity of the punishment. But he will not die and be relieved. Instead, he will remain alive and complain of the punishment. In front of him there is another severe punishment that awaits him."
"Like ashes are the deeds of those who deny their Lord, which the wind blows away on a windy day. They shall have no power over what they earned. This is the farthest limit of going astray.",17,14,مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ ٱشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِى يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ لَّا يَقْدِرُونَ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلضَّلَٰلُ ٱلْبَعِيدُ,"The righteous actions of the disbelievers, such as giving charity and having kindness and mercy towards a weak person, are like ashes on a windy day. They are carried away by the wind and scattered all over the place until no trace of them remains. Such are the deeds of the disbelievers, which are blown away by disbelief. These deeds will not benefit their owners on the Day of Judgement. Actions that are not based on faith are deviations that are far from the path of truth."
Do you not see that God has created the heavens and the earth with ultimate reason? If He so wills He could take you away from the earth and raise a new creation (in your place).,18,14,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"Do you not know—and this language is directed to anyone it suits—that Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He did not create them in vain? If He wishes to remove you, O people, and replace you with a different creation that will worship and obey Him in your place, He would have done so and produced a different creation that would worship and obey Him. It would be an easy matter for Him."
This is well within the power of God.,19,14,وَمَا ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,"Destroying you and replacing you with a different creation is not difficult for Him, may He be Glorified. Allah is capable of all things, and Nothing is outside His ability."
"When they will all appear before God together, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: ""We were your followers, so can you now save us a little from God's punishment?"" They will say: ""If we had been guided by God we would surely have shown you the way. To lament or endure is all the same to us now. No getting away is there for us.""",20,14,وَبَرَزُوا۟ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا فَقَالَ ٱلضُّعَفَٰٓؤُا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّغْنُونَ عَنَّا مِنْ عَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ قَالُوا۟ لَوْ هَدَىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ لَهَدَيْنَٰكُمْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَجَزِعْنَآ أَمْ صَبَرْنَا مَا لَنَا مِن مَّحِيصٍ,"The created things emerged from their graves towards Allah on the Appointed Day. The weak followers said to their eminent leaders: “O masters, we were followers to you. We were commanded by your command, and forbidden by your prohibition. So will you protect us against any of Allah’s punishments? The eminent leaders said: “If Allah had directed us towards guidance, we would have ushered you towards it. Then we would all have been saved from His punishment. However, we were misguided and we lead you astray. It is the same for the both of us, whether we are too weak to bear the punishment or are patient, there is no escaping the punishment for us”."
"When the reckoning is over Satan will say: ""The promise that was made to you by God was indeed a true promise; but I went back on the promise I had made, for I had no power over you except to call you; and you responded to my call. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. Neither can I help you nor can you give me help. I disavow your having associated me earlier (with God). The punishment for those who are wicked is painful indeed.""",21,14,وَقَالَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ لَمَّا قُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَٰنٍ إِلَّآ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَٱسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى فَلَا تَلُومُونِى وَلُومُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُم مَّآ أَنَا۠ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُصْرِخِىَّ إِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ إِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"When the people of paradise entered paradise, and the people of hellfire entered hellfire, Iblis said: “Indeed Allah gave you a true promise, and he carried out his promise to you. I gave you a false promise and I failed to fulfil my promise to you. With whatever strength I have I will use to compel you in this world towards disbelief and misguidance. I invited you towards disbelieve and made sins attractive to you, so you were quick to follow me. Do not blame me for what befell you of misguidance, but blame yourselves because yourselves are more deserving of blame. I will not help you in averting your penalty, and you will not help me in averting my penalty. I denounce that you made me a partner with Allah in your worship. Those who do wrong by associating partners with Allah in this world and disbelieve in Him have a painful penalty that awaits them on the Day of Judgment."
"Those who believed and did the right, will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide by the leave of their Lord, with 'Peace' as their salutation.",22,14,وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَٰمٌ,"By contrast to the fate of the wrongdoers, Allah caused those who have faith and do good deeds to enter Paradise with rivers flowing under its palaces and trees. They will dwell in it eternally in the presence of their Lord. They will greet one another, the angels will greet them and their Lord, may He be Glorified, will greet them with peace."
"Do you not see how God compares a noble act to a healthy tree whose roots are firm and branches in the sky, which yields",23,14,أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ,"O Messenger, do you not know how Allah presented an example of the monotheistic phrase: “There is no deity but Allah”, when He likened it to an excellent tree, the date palm. Its trunk shoots into the earth’s floor and it drinks water with its excellent roots. Its branches reach out into the sky, drinking from the moisture and inhaling the good wind."
"By the leave of its Lord its fruit in all seasons, God presents words of wisdom to men that they might reflect.",24,14,تُؤْتِىٓ أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍۭ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"This excellent tree provides its sweet fruit each time by the permission of its Lord. Allah, the Exalted, may He be Glorified, provides examples for people to encourage them to remember."
An evil act is like a rotten tree torn out of the earth with no (base or) firmness.,25,14,وَمَثَلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ ٱجْتُثَّتْ مِن فَوْقِ ٱلْأَرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِن قَرَارٍ,"The example of the bad word of disbelief is that of a bad tree, the colocynth. It is removed from its foundation with no stability on the earth. Nor does it extend into the sky, so it dies and is scattered by the wind. The word of disbelief results in ruin, and its owner’s good deeds will not reach Allah."
"With immutuble words God makes the faithful dauntless in the life of the world and the life to come, but leads the unjust into error, for God does as He pleases.",26,14,يُثَبِّتُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱلْقَوْلِ ٱلثَّابِتِ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَيُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ وَيَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ,"Through the monotheistic word, Allah makes the believers firm in their belief in the world until they die upon belief, as well as in the Transitory Stage in their graves when they are asked, and He will make them firm on the Day of Judgment. By causing them to associate partners with Him and disbelieve in Him, Allah will lead the wrongdoers away from guidance and what is correct. Allah does as He wishes when it comes to leading astray whomever He wants in accordance with His justice and guiding whomever He wants in accordance with His grace. Allah cannot be coerced (may He be glorified)."
"Have you not looked at those who repaid God's favours with ingratitude; who pulled their people down to ruin,",27,14,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ بَدَّلُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ كُفْرًا وَأَحَلُّوا۟ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ ٱلْبَوَارِ,"You have seen the circumstance of those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger from amongst Quraysh when they rejected Allah’s favor of having kept them safe in the Sacred Precinct. And in sending Muhammad, peace be upon Him, to them, they chose disbelief in His favours when they belied what he had brought them from their Lord. They caused their people that followed them in disbelieving to descend into the abode of destruction."
"Hell, where they will roast in the fire? And what an evil repository!",28,14,جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا وَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرَارُ,"The abode of destruction is the Hellfire that they will enter. They will suffer its heat, and the worst of dwellings with be theirs to dwell in."
"They have appointed equals of God to mislead people from His path. Tell them: ""Enjoy yourselves (so long as you may). In the end you have to go to Hell.""",29,14,وَجَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا لِّيُضِلُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ قُلْ تَمَتَّعُوا۟ فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"The idolaters made idols and counterparts for Allah so that they would lead their followers away from Allah’s path after they had been lead away from it. O Messenger, say to them: “Enjoy the objects of desire in your possession, and the spreading of doubt in the world. On the Day of Judgment your recompense will be the Hellfire, and you will have no other recompense besides it”."
"Tell those of My creatures who believe: ""Observe your devotional obligations and give of what We have given you in charity, secretly or openly, before the Day arrives when there will be no buying or selling or befriending.""",30,14,قُل لِّعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ يُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خِلَٰلٌ,"O Messenger, say to the believers: “O believers! Perform the prayer with perfection. With the wealth Allah has given you, give obligatory and recommended charity in a secretive manner to avoid conceit, but also openly so others will take you as an example. Do so before a day arrives in which there is no trade or ransom to redeem yourself from Allah’s punishment, nor is there any friendship where a friend may intercede on the other’s behalf”."
"It is God who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for your food thereby, and made you master of the ships that ply in the oceans by His command, subjected the rivers to your control,",31,14,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلْفُلْكَ لِتَجْرِىَ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرَ,"Allah is the One Who has generated the heavens and the earth as things unlike anything else. He caused water to fall as rain from the heavens, and from that water He caused different types of crops to sprout as sustenance for you, O people. In accordance with His judgment, Allah subjugated ships for you to travel over water, and He subjugated rivers so that you could drink from them and water your livestock and crops."
And subjugated the sun and moon for you so that they perform their tasks diligently; and subdued the night and day for your service.,32,14,وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَآئِبَيْنِ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ,"Allah subjugated the sun and the moon to continuously orbit. He subjugated the day and the night to alternate, the night for your sleep and rest and the day for your activity and work."
"He gave you whatsoever you asked. If you try to count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate. Man is most unjust indeed, full of ingratitude.",33,14,وَءَاتَىٰكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَآ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ,"He gave you from everything you requested, and even from what you did not request. If you try to count Allah’s favors, you will not be able to due to their plenitude and variety. What was mentioned is but examples of His favours to you. Indeed, man is ever oppressive towards himself and very ungrateful of Allah’s (the Exalted, may He be Glorified) favours."
"Remember when Abraham prayed: ""O Lord, make this a city of peace, and preserve me and my progeny from worshipping idols:",34,14,وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدَ ءَامِنًا وَٱجْنُبْنِى وَبَنِىَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ,"O Messenger, recall when Ibrahim said, after relocating his son Ismael and Ismael’s mother, Hajar, in the valley of Makkah: “Oh Lord! Make this city, Makkah, in which I have placed my family, a city of peace wherein no blood is shed and no person oppresses another. Distance myself and my children from the worship of idols”."
"Many a man have they led astray, O Lord. So he who follows me is truly of me; but as for him who disobeys me, surely You are forgiving and kind.",35,14,رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَمَن تَبِعَنِى فَإِنَّهُۥ مِنِّى وَمَنْ عَصَانِى فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"“O Lord! The idols have misguided many people when they believed that the idols would intercede for them. They were allured to the idols, and they worshipped them instead of Allah. Whoever follows me in claiming Allah as One and obeying Him, then he is among my party and followers. Whoever disobeys me and does not follow me in claiming Allah as One and obeying Him, then You, O Lord, are Forgiving of the sins of whomever You wish and You are Merciful towards them”."
"I have settled some of my children, O Lord, in a barren valley near Your sacred House, so that, O our Lord, they may be constant in devotion. So put in the hearts of men some kindness for them, and provide fruits for them: They may haply be grateful.",36,14,رَّبَّنَآ إِنِّىٓ أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِى بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِى زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ ٱلْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ فَٱجْعَلْ أَفْـِٔدَةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ تَهْوِىٓ إِلَيْهِمْ وَٱرْزُقْهُم مِّنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ,"“Our Lord, I have placed some of my decedents, Ismael and his children, to dwell in a valley (i.e., Makkah) in which there is no crop and no water inside Your sacred House. Our Lord, You caused them to dwell by Your House so they may uptake praying in it, so cause peoples’ hearts to have compassion towards them and this city. And grant them sustenance from the crops in the hope that they will be thankful for the favors You have bestowed upon them”."
"O Lord, You have knowledge of what we hide and what we reveal, for nothing on the earth or in the skies is hidden from God.",37,14,رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ تَعْلَمُ مَا نُخْفِى وَمَا نُعْلِنُ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ,"Our Lord, You know all that we keep secret and make known. Nothing on Earth or in the heavens remains hidden from Allah. He knows of it, so our need and dependence on Him does not remain hidden from Him."
All praise be to God who bestowed on me Ishmael and Isaac in old age. Verily my Lord listens to prayer.,38,14,ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى ٱلْكِبَرِ إِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,"Thanks and praise are due to Allah, may He be glorified, Who answered my supplication to grant me someone righteous. In my old age, He gave me Ismael from Hajar and Ishaq from Sara. My Lord, praised be He, hears the supplication of the supplicant."
"Grant, O Lord, that I and my offspring may remain constant in devotion. Grant, O Lord, my supplication.",39,14,رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْنِى مُقِيمَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِى رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ,"O Lord, make me able to perform my prayer with perfection, and make my descendants people who do that also. Our Lord, answer and accept our prayer."
"O Lord, forgive me, my parents and the faithful on the Day the reckoning is done.""",40,14,رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَٰلِدَىَّ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَوْمَ يَقُومُ ٱلْحِسَابُ,"“Our Lord, forgive me my sins, and forgive the sins of my father (he said that before he knew that his father was an enemy of Allah. When it became clear to him that his father was Allah’s enemy, he repudiated his father). And forgive the sins of the believers on the day that mankind goes forth to be taken to account in front of their Lord.”"
"Think not God is oblivious of the deeds of the wicked. He has only allowed them respite till the Day on which all eyes would stare aghast,",41,14,وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَٰفِلًا عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ ٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ,"O Messenger, do not think that if Allah delays the punishment of the wrongdoers that He neglected their acts of lying, obstructing the path to Allah and other such deeds. Allah is aware of these things and nothing remains hidden from Him. Indeed, Allah delays their punishment until the Day of Judgment, the day that people’s eyes will stare in horror at the terror they will witness."
"(And) they would hasten forward, heads lifted upwards, gazes fixed, and emptied out their hearts.",42,14,مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِى رُءُوسِهِمْ لَا يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ وَأَفْـِٔدَتُهُمْ هَوَآءٌ,"When people will come forth from their graves, hurrying towards the caller, with their heads raised and anxiously gazing at the sky. Their gaze does not come back to them, but remains fixed because of the horror they witness. Their hearts are empty and are unable to comprehend, and they have no sense of understanding due to the terrifying thing they witness."
"Warn the people of that Day when the punishment would be inflicted upon them. Then will the wicked say: ""O our Lord, give us respite a while more. We shall heed Your call and follow the apostles."" (But they will be told,): ""Are you not those who used to swear: 'There is no reverse for us?'",43,14,وَأَنذِرِ ٱلنَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُوٓا۟ أَقْسَمْتُم مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُم مِّن زَوَالٍ,"O Messenger, make your people fear Allah’s punishment on the Day of Judgment. Those who wronged themselves by disbelieving in Allah and associating partners with Him will say: “Our Lord, give respite to us, and delay for us the punishment. Return us to the world for a short period so we can believe in You and follow the messengers you sent to us”. They will be given a reprimanding response: “Did you not swear, while you were on earth, that you would not be transferred from the world to the afterlife, and you disbelieved in the resurrection after death?”"
"Yet you dwelt in the dwellings of those who had exceeded themselves, and it was evident to you how We had dealt with them; and We held out examples before you.""",44,14,وَسَكَنتُمْ فِى مَسَٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمْ كَيْفَ فَعَلْنَا بِهِمْ وَضَرَبْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْأَمْثَالَ,"You took residence in the living spaces of previous nations, who before you had wronged themselves by disbelieving in Allah, such as the nations of Hūd and Ṣāliḥ. The destruction I caused to befall them was made clear to you. We also gave you examples in the book of Allah so that you would be warned, but you did not take them as a warning."
"Still they are plotting their plots, but evident are their plots to God, even though they are so adroit as to make the mountains move.",45,14,وَقَدْ مَكَرُوا۟ مَكْرَهُمْ وَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَكْرُهُمْ وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ ٱلْجِبَالُ,"Those who took up residence in the living spaces of the wrongful nations arranged a plot to kill the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and put an end to his mission. Allah knows of their plans and nothing remains hidden from Him. Their plan was weak, for it is unable to move the mountains or anything else, contrary to Allah’s plan against them."
"Think not that God would go back on His promise (made) to the apostles. Indeed God is mighty, the Lord of retribution.",46,14,فَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِۦ رُسُلَهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنتِقَامٍ,"O Messenger, do not think that Allah, Who promised His messengers victory and the establishment of the religion, has given up on His promise to His messengers. Allah is noble and nothing overcomes His decree. He will strengthen and support His allies whilst reserving severe vengeance for His enemies and the enemies of His Messengers."
"The day when the earth will he replaced by some other than the earth, as will be the skies, and every one will appear before God the one and omnipotent,",47,14,يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ ٱلْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَبَرَزُوا۟ لِلَّهِ ٱلْوَٰحِدِ ٱلْقَهَّارِ,"This revenge against the disbelievers will occur on the Day of Judgement, on the day that this earth will be exchanged for a barren and dustless earth and the skies will be exchanged for different skies. People will exit their graves with their bodies and deeds so that they can stand before Allah, Who alone is the possessor and owner of kingdom and majesty. He subdues and is never subdued and He defeats and is never defeated."
You will see the wicked on that day bound together in chains.,48,14,وَتَرَى ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّقَرَّنِينَ فِى ٱلْأَصْفَادِ,"Their clothes will be made from resin (a highly flammable substance), and their sullen faces will be covered with fire."
"Of molten pitch shall be their garments, their faces covered with flames,",49,14,سَرَابِيلُهُم مِّن قَطِرَانٍ وَتَغْشَىٰ وُجُوهَهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ,"Their clothes will be made from resin (a highly flammable substance), and their sullen faces will be covered with fire."
That God may reward each soul for its deeds. Indeed God is swift at reckoning!,50,14,لِيَجْزِىَ ٱللَّهُ كُلَّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Allah will recompense each soul for the good and evil it did, and Allah is swift in taking account. He will account for the first ones on a single day, and His accounting for one will not distract Him from accounting for another."
"This is a message for mankind that they may take a warning from it, and may know that He is the one and only God, and that men of wisdom may reflect.",51,14,هَٰذَا بَلَٰغٌ لِّلنَّاسِ وَلِيُنذَرُوا۟ بِهِۦ وَلِيَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ وَلِيَذَّكَّرَ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"This Qur’ān, which was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), is a forewarning from Allah to mankind so that they may take heed of the warnings and severe threats in it; and so they may know that the one who is obeyed in truth is Allah alone so that they will worship Him and not associate any partners with Him. Also, so that those with sound intellects will be admonished and warned by it, as they are the ones who will benefit from admonitions and warnings."
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the Book and the perspicuous oration.,0,15,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓر تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَقُرْءَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,"This sūrah begins with the disconnected letters, the explanation for which has already preceeded in Sūrah Baqarah. These verses are very significant, which indicates that they are revealed from Allah. They are verses of a Qur’ān that clarifies monotheism and sacred laws."
The unbelievers would haply like to wish that they had submitted (and become Muslim).,1,15,رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ مُسْلِمِينَ,"On the Day of Judgement, when things become clear to them, the disbelievers will wish they were Muslim. The falsity of their ways in the world will be made clear to them."
"Leave them to feast and revel, beguiled by hope; they will come to know soon.",2,15,ذَرْهُمْ يَأْكُلُوا۟ وَيَتَمَتَّعُوا۟ وَيُلْهِهِمُ ٱلْأَمَلُ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, leave these beliers to eat as the beasts eat, and to avail themselves of the finite pleasures of the world and let their hopes distract them from faith and righteous actions. They will come to know the loss they are in when they face Allah on the Day of Judgement."
Not one habitation have We destroyed but at the time determined for it.,3,15,وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا وَلَهَا كِتَابٌ مَّعْلُومٌ,"For each oppressive town that became destroyed, Allah already knew of its fixed time. The destruction will neither come before or after its time."
No people can hasten or delay the term already fixed for them.,4,15,مَّا تَسْبِقُ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ,"A nation will not be destroyed before its appointed time, and its destruction will not be delayed when its time arrives. The wrongdoers should not have hope in Allah delaying their fate."
"And yet they say: ""You, to whom this Exposition has been sent are surely possessed of the Devil.",5,15,وَقَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ,"The disbelievers from Makkah said to the Messenger (peace be upon him): O you to whom the remembrance was revealed (as the Messenger himself used to claim), your claims make you out to be one who is possessed, and you behave as possessed people do."
"If you are a man of truth, why can't you bring the angels to us?""",6,15,لَّوْ مَا تَأْتِينَا بِٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Why do you not call forth the angels to testify on your behalf, or why do you not ask for us to be destroyed because of our disbelief?"
"But then We never send the angels down save with the purpose (of enforcing their doom), after which they will not be given more respite.",7,15,مَا نُنَزِّلُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُوٓا۟ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ,"In response to their idea of having the angels brought forth, Allah said: I will not send the angels except when it becomes wise to do so, that is, when your time comes to be penalised. And if the angels were sent and they did not believe, then their punishment would become imminent."
"We have sent down this Exposition, and We will guard it.",8,15,إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا ٱلذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَحَٰفِظُونَ,"I alone revealed this Qur’ān to the heart of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a reminder for people. I will guard the Qur’ān from anything being added to it or subtracted from it, or anything in it being exchanged or altered."
We had also sent apostles to people of earlier persuasions.,9,15,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى شِيَعِ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"O Messenger, I sent before you messengers to prior groups of disbelievers and they belied them. So you are not an exceptional messenger from the perspective of being made out as a liar by your people."
But never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff.,10,15,وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,Previous groups of disbelievers did not receive a messenger except that they belied and ridiculed him.
We place in the hearts of sinners (disbelief).,11,15,كَذَٰلِكَ نَسْلُكُهُۥ فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"As I left the lies in the hearts of those nations, I will leave it as well in the hearts of the Makkahn idolaters, because of their opposition and stubbornness."
"So, they will not believe in it: The example of former people is there.",12,15,لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ سُنَّةُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"They do not believe in this Qur’ān that was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allah’s custom in destroying those who bely their messengers has occurred before, so the beliers should take that into consideration."
"Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight,",13,15,وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّوا۟ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ,"These liars will remain stubborn even if the truth became obvious to them through clear proofs, even if I opened for them a door from the heavens and they continued to ascend through it."
"They will say all the same: ""Our eyes were dazed (and clouded over). We were a people ensorcelled.""",14,15,لَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَٰرُنَا بَلْ نَحْنُ قَوْمٌ مَّسْحُورُونَ,"They would not believe, and they said: Our eyes could no longer see, and what we saw was the effects of magic, so we are bewitched."
"We have placed the signs of the Zodiac in the sky, and decked it out for those who can see;",15,15,وَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّٰهَا لِلنَّٰظِرِينَ,"We placed in the heavens great stars so as to guide people on their travels in the darkness of the desert and the sea. We also created them for those who ponder them, so that they would come to understand the ability of Allah, may He be glorified."
"And We have preserved it from every accursed devil,",16,15,وَحَفِظْنَٰهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَٰنٍ رَّجِيمٍ,We protected the heavens from every satan that is rejected from Allah’s mercy.
"Except the ones who listen on the sly, yet they are chased away by a shooting flame.",17,15,إِلَّا مَنِ ٱسْتَرَقَ ٱلسَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُۥ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Except for those who try to secretly listen to the high realm, they will be struck with a flaming meteor and they will be burned."
"We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and made all things grow upon it balanced evenly.",18,15,وَٱلْأَرْضَ مَدَدْنَٰهَا وَأَلْقَيْنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ وَأَنۢبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْزُونٍ,"I flattened the earth so that people would dwell on it, and we placed sturdy mountains on it so that it (i.e. the earth) would not shake the people, and I planted in it a variety of crops [...]"
"We have provided on it sustenance for you, and for those you cannot provide.",19,15,وَجَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَعَٰيِشَ وَمَن لَّسْتُمْ لَهُۥ بِرَٰزِقِينَ,"O people, I have placed for you on the earth foods and drinks that would sustain you so long as you are in the worldly life."
"Of all things there are We have the stores, and send them down in determined measure.",20,15,وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلَّا عِندَنَا خَزَآئِنُهُۥ وَمَا نُنَزِّلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِقَدَرٍ مَّعْلُومٍ,For all that benefits people and animals I am able to produce it and benefit people with it. I do not provide such things except according to a specific quantity determined by My wisdom and will.
"We send rain-impregnated winds, and water from the sky which you drink, but you are not the keepers of its store.",21,15,وَأَرْسَلْنَا ٱلرِّيَٰحَ لَوَٰقِحَ فَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَسْقَيْنَٰكُمُوهُ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ لَهُۥ بِخَٰزِنِينَ,"I sent the winds to fertilise the cloud, and I sent rain down from the fertilised clouds and I nourished you from rain water. O people, you are not containers of this water on earth in springs and wells, rather Allah is the One Who contains the water in them."
"It is We who give life and We who give death, and We are the One who will abide.",22,15,وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ نُحْىِۦ وَنُمِيتُ وَنَحْنُ ٱلْوَٰرِثُونَ,I revive the dead by creating them out of nothing and resurrecting them after death. And I cause the living to die when their time comes. I am the One Who will remain and inherit the earth and whatever is upon it.
We surely know those of you who go forward and those of you who lag behind.,23,15,وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا ٱلْمُسْتَقْدِمِينَ مِنكُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا ٱلْمُسْتَـْٔخِرِينَ,"I know of who was born and died before you, and of those who will be born and die after. Nothing of that is hidden from Me."
Your Lord will surely gather them together: Certainly He is all-wise and all-knowing.,24,15,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,"O Messenger, your Lord will gather them all on the Day of Judgment in order to credit the good doer for his good deeds, and the evil doer for his sins. He is Wise in His arrangement and knowledgeable. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"Man We fashioned from fermented clay dried tingling hard,",25,15,وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن صَلْصَٰلٍ مِّنْ حَمَإٍ مَّسْنُونٍ,"I created Adam from dried clay, if it is struck it sounds. This clay that he was created from is black and of an altered scent beacuse of the duration it has been left."
As We fashioned jinns before from intense radiated heat.,26,15,وَٱلْجَآنَّ خَلَقْنَٰهُ مِن قَبْلُ مِن نَّارِ ٱلسَّمُومِ,I created the father of the jinn from scolding fire before I created Adam (upon him be peace).
"But when your Lord said to the angels: ""I am verily going to create a human being from fermented clay dried tingling hard;",27,15,وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنِّى خَٰلِقٌۢ بَشَرًا مِّن صَلْصَٰلٍ مِّنْ حَمَإٍ مَّسْنُونٍ,"O Messenger, remember when Allah said to the angels and Iblis, who was with them: I will create a being from dried clay that rings when it is hit, it is black and of an altered scent."
"And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, bow before him in homage;""",28,15,فَإِذَا سَوَّيْتُهُۥ وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِى فَقَعُوا۟ لَهُۥ سَٰجِدِينَ,If I fashion his image and perfect his creation then prostrate to him in obedience to My command and to greet him.
The angels bowed in homage in a body,29,15,فَسَجَدَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ,"The angels obeyed, so they all prostrated as their Lord commanded them."
Except Iblis. He refused to bow with the adorers.,30,15,إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"As for Iblis, who was with the angels but was not one himself, refused to prostrate to Adam along with the angels."
"""How is it, O Iblis,"" said (the Lord), ""you did not join those who bowed in homage?""",31,15,قَالَ يَٰٓإِبْلِيسُ مَا لَكَ أَلَّا تَكُونَ مَعَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"After Iblis refused to prostrate to Adam, Allah said to him: What kept you and prevented you from prostrating with the angels, who prostrated out of obedience to My command?"
"""How could I bow,"" said he, ""before a mortal whom You created from fermented clay dried tingling hard?""",32,15,قَالَ لَمْ أَكُن لِّأَسْجُدَ لِبَشَرٍ خَلَقْتَهُۥ مِن صَلْصَٰلٍ مِّنْ حَمَإٍ مَّسْنُونٍ,"Iblis arrogantly said: It is not proper for me to prostrate to a being You created out of dried clay that used to be black, malleable clay."
"""Go hence, execrable,"" (said the Lord), ""from this place,",33,15,قَالَ فَٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّكَ رَجِيمٌ,"Allah said to Iblis: Exit from paradise, for you are banished."
"Condemned till the day of Doom!""",34,15,وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكَ ٱللَّعْنَةَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,Upon you is My damnation and banished you are from My mercy until the Day of Judgment.
"""O my Lord,"" said he, ""give me respite till the day the dead are raised.""",35,15,قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرْنِىٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,"Iblis said: O Lord, allow me to live and do not cause me to die until the day that Adam and his offspring are resurrected."
"""You are among the reprieved,"" (said the Lord),",36,15,قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ,Allah (the Exalted) said: You are of those who I will grant a long life.
"""Till the predetermined time.""",37,15,إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْوَقْتِ ٱلْمَعْلُومِ,"Until the time when all created things will die, upon the first blow of the Horn."
"""O my Lord,"" he said, ""since You have led me into error I'll beguile them with the pleasures of the world and lead them astray,",38,15,قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَغْوَيْتَنِى لَأُزَيِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَأُغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Iblis said: O Lord, because You misguided me, I will make sins on earth seem attractive to them, and I will lead them all astray from the straight path."
"Except the chosen ones among Your creatures.""",39,15,إِلَّا عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,Except for those servants You select to be worshipful to You.
"(To which God) said: ""This way is right by Me.",40,15,قَالَ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ عَلَىَّ مُسْتَقِيمٌ,Allah said: This is a straight path that leads to Me.
"No power shall you have over (all) My creatures except those who fall into error and follow you,",41,15,إِنَّ عِبَادِى لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَٰنٌ إِلَّا مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلْغَاوِينَ,"You have no power or sway over tempting My sincere servants, except for those who follow you who are led astray."
"For whom the ordained place is surely Hell,",42,15,وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمَوْعِدُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,Hellfire is the promised abode of Iblis and all those who follow him who have been led astray.
"Which has several gates, and each gate is marked for every section of them.""",43,15,لَهَا سَبْعَةُ أَبْوَٰبٍ لِّكُلِّ بَابٍ مِّنْهُمْ جُزْءٌ مَّقْسُومٌ,"Hellfire has seven doors through which they enter. For each of its doors, there is a known amount of the followers of Iblis who will enter through it."
Verily those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path shall be in the midst of gardens and springs of water.,44,15,إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,"Those who were mindful of Allah, by obeying His command and staying away from disobedience will have gardens and springs."
"""Enter in peace and tranquility,"" (they will be told).",45,15,ٱدْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَٰمٍ ءَامِنِينَ,"When they enter, it will be said to them: Enter it with safety from any misfortune and security from any fears."
We shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts. (There) they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together.,46,15,وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِى صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَٰنًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَٰبِلِينَ,"I removed what was in their chests of enmity and envy. They are brethren beloved to one another, sitting upon thrones and looked upon one another."
"No weariness will come upon them, nor will they be sent away from there.",47,15,لَا يَمَسُّهُمْ فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَمَا هُم مِّنْهَا بِمُخْرَجِينَ,"Fatigue does not affect them, and they will not be made to leave it. Rather, they will remain in it forever."
"Announce to My creatures that I am indeed forgiving and kind,",48,15,نَبِّئْ عِبَادِىٓ أَنِّىٓ أَنَا ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger, inform My servants that I am the Forgiving towards whomever of them repents, and I am Merciful to them."

Inform them about the matter of Abraham's guests.,50,15,وَنَبِّئْهُمْ عَن ضَيْفِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ,"And inform them of the story of the guests of Ibrahim (peace be with him) that were angels who came to give him glad tidings of a child, and news of the destructions of the people of Lot."
"When they came to him and said: ""Peace,"" he answered: ""Truly we are afraid of you.""",51,15,إِذْ دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ فَقَالُوا۟ سَلَٰمًا قَالَ إِنَّا مِنكُمْ وَجِلُونَ,"When they came to him and said, Peace. He answered them with a greeting that was better than theirs and presented them with a roasted calf for them to eat because he thought that they were human.

""So do not be one of those who despair.""",54,15,قَالُوا۟ بَشَّرْنَٰكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْقَٰنِطِينَ,"The Messengers from the Angels said to Abraham: We bring you good news of the truth in which there is no doubt, so do not be among those who despair from the good news we bring you."

"""Did we not restrain you,"" they said, ""from (entertaining) creatures from the outside world?""",69,15,قَالُوٓا۟ أَوَلَمْ نَنْهَكَ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,His people said to him: Did we not forbid you from hosting anyone? One who provides a warning has in effect excused himself for taking someone to account for not abiding by it.
"""Here are my daughters,"" said Lot, ""if you are so active.""",70,15,قَالَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ بَنَاتِىٓ إِن كُنتُمْ فَٰعِلِينَ,"Lot (peace be with him) said to them: These are the women of my people, who are like daughters to me. Marry them if you want to satisfy your desires."
Verily by your life they were utterly confused in their (lustful) drunkenness.,71,15,لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,By your life - O Messenger - the people of Lot wander blindly in pursuit of their lusts.
So they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day;,72,15,فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ مُشْرِقِينَ,The destructive punishment seized them at the time of sunrise.
"And We turned the city upside down, and rained on them stones of hardened lava.",73,15,فَجَعَلْنَا عَٰلِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ,We turned their towns upside down and rained on them a shower of petrified clay.
Herein are really signs for those who discern.,74,15,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّلْمُتَوَسِّمِينَ,In the incident mentioned about the punishment that descended on the people of Lot there are signs for those who ponder.
This (city) lies on a road that still survives.,75,15,وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٍ مُّقِيمٍ,The towns of the people of Lot are on an existing road and can be seen by travellers who pass by.
Indeed there is a portent in this for those who believe.,76,15,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,In that which occurred there is a sign for the believers to take lesson from.
The dwellers of the Wood (near Midian) were also wicked.,77,15,وَإِن كَانَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْأَيْكَةِ لَظَٰلِمِينَ,"The people of Shuayb, who lived in a town surrounded by intertwined trees, were wrongdoers; because of their denial of Allah and rejection of His Messenger, Shuayb (peace be with him)."
"So We punished them too. They are both situated by the highway, clearly visible.",78,15,فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ,We took retribution from them when the punishment seized them. The towns of the people of Lot and the dwellings of the people of Shuayb are on a path clear to those who pass by.
The people of Al-Hijr denied Our apostles;,79,15,وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْحِجْرِ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Indeed the Thamud, who were the people of Hijr (a place between Hijaz and the Levant) had in effect rejected all the Messengers when they rejected their prophet, Salih (peace be with him.)"
And though We had given them Our signs they turned away from them.,80,15,وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا فَكَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ,We gave them proofs and signs to indicate his truthfulness in what he brought from his Lord. One of these was the she-camel. But they did not take a lesson from those signs and paid no attention to them.
They used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security.,81,15,وَكَانُوا۟ يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا ءَامِنِينَ,They used to carve out dwellings in the rocks of the mountains in which they lived safe from that which they feared.
But they were seized by the mighty blast towards the morning;,82,15,فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ مُصْبِحِينَ,Then the bolt of the punishment seized them in the morning.
And all that they had done (for security) availed them nothing.,83,15,فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,The wealth and the dwellings that they had gained did not ward off Allah’s punishment.
We have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them. The Hour (of the great change) is certain to come. So turn away (from them) with a grace.,84,15,وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لَءَاتِيَةٌ فَٱصْفَحِ ٱلصَّفْحَ ٱلْجَمِيلَ,"We did not create the heavens and the earth and we did not create everything between them in vain without any wisdom. We only created all of that with a true purpose. The Hour will certainly come, so, O Messenger, ignore those who reject you and pardon them graciously."
Surely your Lord is the Creator and knows (everything).,85,15,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلْخَلَّٰقُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, is the Creator and the Knower of everything."
"We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated (examples), and the majestic Qur'an.",86,15,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَٰكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ ٱلْمَثَانِى وَٱلْقُرْءَانَ ٱلْعَظِيمَ,We have given you ‘The Opening (Sūrah Al-Fātiḥah)’ which consists of seven verses and We have given you the Grand Qur’ān.
"So covet not things We have bestowed on a portion of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and protect those who believe;",87,15,لَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِۦٓ أَزْوَٰجًا مِّنْهُمْ وَلَا تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَٱخْفِضْ جَنَاحَكَ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Do not extend your sight to the temporary enjoyments We have given to some classes of disbelievers and do not grieve over their rejection. Be humble with the believers.
"And say: ""I am a distinct warner,""",88,15,وَقُلْ إِنِّىٓ أَنَا ٱلنَّذِيرُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,Say - O Messenger: I am indeed a warner of the punishment and I make clear that which will guide you.
Like (those) We had sent to those schismatics who slandered their Books,89,15,كَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَى ٱلْمُقْتَسِمِينَ,I warn you of a punishment similar to that which Allah sent down on those who formed an alliance to deny the messengers.
And severed their Scripture into fragments.,90,15,ٱلَّذِينَ جَعَلُوا۟ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ عِضِينَ,"Those who accepts parts of the Qur’ān and allege other parts to be sorcery, soothsaying or poetry."
By your Lord We shall question them one and all,91,15,فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْـَٔلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"By your Lord, O Messenger, I will on the Day of Judgement bring all those who break it into parts to account."
About their deeds.,92,15,عَمَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,We will question them about the disbelief and sins they committed in the world.
"So declare to them what We have enjoined, and turn away from idolaters.",93,15,فَٱصْدَعْ بِمَا تُؤْمَرُ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"So announce, O Messenger, the invitation towards Allah that He has instructed you to do and do not pay any attention to what the idolaters say and do."
"We are surely sufficient to deal with those who scoff at you,",94,15,إِنَّا كَفَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْمُسْتَهْزِءِينَ,"Do not be afraid of them, for we are enough for you against those leaders of disbelief from the Quraysh who mock at you."
Who place other gods besides God. They will come to know soon.,95,15,ٱلَّذِينَ يَجْعَلُونَ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Those who take another deity along with Allah. They will soon come to know the evil outcome of their associating partners with Allah.
We are well aware that you are disheartened by what they say.,96,15,وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ,"We know that your heart, O Messenger, is constrained by the rejection and mockery of you that emanates from them."
"But you should glorify your Lord with praises, and be among those who bow in submission;",97,15,فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"So resort to Allah by declaring His transcendence from everything not appropriate for Him, and by praising Him with the attributes of His perfection; and be one of those who worship Allah and pray to Him. In that there is a cure for the strain on your heart."
And go on worshipping your Lord till the certainty (of death) comes upon you.,98,15,وَٱعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَكَ ٱلْيَقِينُ,Go on worshipping your Lord and continue doing so as long as you live until death comes to you in that state.
THE DECREE of GOD will surely come; so do not try to hasten it: Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.,0,16,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ أَتَىٰٓ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"The Hour and the punishment that Allah has decreed for you - O disbelievers - is close, so do not ask for it to come sooner than its time. Exalted is He and High above that which they associate with Him in their worship."
"He sends the angels with revelation by His command, to any of His creatures as He please, (saying): ""Warn that there is no god but I, so fear Me.""",1,16,يُنَزِّلُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ بِٱلرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِۦ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦٓ أَنْ أَنذِرُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنَا۠ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"He sends down the angels to whichever of His Messengers He wills with revelation that brings life to the souls: Saying: Warn O Messengers, the people against associating partners with Allah, for there is no one deserving of worship besides Me. Be mindful of me - O People - by fulfilling my instructions and avoiding my prohibitions."
He created the heavens and the earth with reason. Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.,2,16,خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ تَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"Allah created the heavens and the earth without any precedent for a true purpose. He did not create them in vain, but created them to serve as a sign of His greatness. He is Exalted and high above their ascribing others as partners to Him."
Man He created from a drop of semen; and still he becomes an open contender.,3,16,خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُّبِينٌ,"He created man from a despised drop of fluid who then progressed from one form to another until he became a harsh contender using falsehood to attempt to invalidate with it the truth, being an obvious opponent in his arguing."
"He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and (other) advantages, and some you eat.",4,16,وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمَ خَلَقَهَا لَكُمْ فِيهَا دِفْءٌ وَمَنَٰفِعُ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"He also created livestock such as camels, cattle and goats for your benefit - O People. Some of these benefits include deriving warmth from their wool and hair and other benefits from their milk, skin and backs. Some of them serve as food that you eat."
"There is life and cheer for you as you drive them home in the evening, and lead them out in the morning to graze.",5,16,وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا جَمَالٌ حِينَ تُرِيحُونَ وَحِينَ تَسْرَحُونَ,There is beauty in them for you in the evening and in the morning when you take them out to graze.
They carry your burdens to lands so distant you could not have reached without much hardship. Indeed your Lord is compassionate and kind.,6,16,وَتَحْمِلُ أَثْقَالَكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَلَدٍ لَّمْ تَكُونُوا۟ بَٰلِغِيهِ إِلَّا بِشِقِّ ٱلْأَنفُسِ إِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,These livestock that We created for you carry your heavy goods when you travel to places that you would only be able to reach after bearing great hardship on yourselves. Your Lord - O People - is Kind and Merciful to you as He has subjugated these livestock to you.
"He created horses, mules and donkeys for riding and for splendour. He created other things too which you do not know.",7,16,وَٱلْخَيْلَ وَٱلْبِغَالَ وَٱلْحَمِيرَ لِتَرْكَبُوهَا وَزِينَةً وَيَخْلُقُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"He created horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and carry your goods on and for them to be an adornment for you that you can beautify yourselves with amongst people. He will create in the future means of transport and other things that you do not know about."
"To God leads the right path, though some deviate. If He willed He could guide you all to the right way.",8,16,وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ قَصْدُ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمِنْهَا جَآئِرٌ وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَىٰكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Allah has made it a duty upon Himself to show the Path that leads to His Pleasure, which is Islam. Some paths are that of Satan that deviate away from the truth. Any path other than the path of Islam is deviated. Had Allah willed to guide you all to Faith He would have guided you alltogether."
"It is He who sends down water from the sky of which you drink, and which nourishes the plants you feed your cattle,",9,16,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً لَّكُم مِّنْهُ شَرَابٌ وَمِنْهُ شَجَرٌ فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who sent down for you water from the clouds. From this water you have a drink that you and your livestock can drink of. From it you get vegetation on which you can graze your animals."
"With which He makes crops grow, and olives, dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you. In this is a sign for those who think.",10,16,يُنۢبِتُ لَكُم بِهِ ٱلزَّرْعَ وَٱلزَّيْتُونَ وَٱلنَّخِيلَ وَٱلْأَعْنَٰبَ وَمِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"With that water, Allah grows for you the crops that you eat. He also grows for you olives, date-palms and grapes as well as other types of fruit. In that water and the things that it gives rise to there is a sign of Allah’s power for people who ponder over His creation and use it as evidence of Allah’s greatness."
"He harnessed the day and night for you, as also the sun, the moon and the stars, by His command. In this are signs for men who understand.",11,16,وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ وَٱلنُّجُومُ مُسَخَّرَٰتٌۢ بِأَمْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah subjugated the night for you so that you can find peace and rest in it, and the day so that you can earn your livelihood in it. He put the sun at your service and made it bright and the moon, which He made a light. The stars are subjugated for you by His decree, which you use for navigation in the darknesses of the sea and land and by which you come to know time etc. In the subjugation of all of these things there are clear signs of Allah’s power for people who apply their minds, for they are the ones who will grasp the wisdom in them."
And other things of different shades has He produced on the earth for you. In this are signs for those who reflect.,12,16,وَمَا ذَرَأَ لَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُخْتَلِفًا أَلْوَٰنُهُۥٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, also subjugated for you the things on earth that He created having diverse colours such as minerals, animals, plants and crops. In what He has created and subjugated for you there is a clear sign of Allah’s power for people to pay heed and realise that Allah is a powerful benefactor."
"It is He who has subdued the sea that you may eat fresh meat from it, and obtain ornaments to wear. You see the ships plough through it that you may seek of His bounties and, perhaps, be grateful.",13,16,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى سَخَّرَ ٱلْبَحْرَ لِتَأْكُلُوا۟ مِنْهُ لَحْمًا طَرِيًّا وَتَسْتَخْرِجُوا۟ مِنْهُ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلْفُلْكَ مَوَاخِرَ فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"He, may He be glorified, is the One Who subjugated the sea for you and enabled you to travel on it and to extract what is in it, so that you can eat the fresh and soft meat of the fish that you catch and that you can extract from it jewellery that you and your wives can wear such as pearls and coral. You see the ships splitting the waves of the ocean and you travel on these ships in search of Allah's bounty in the form of profit you gain from trade. All of this is for you to be grateful to Allah for the favours He has given you and to worship Him alone."
"He placed stablisers in the earth so that while it revolves you live undisturbed, and rivers and tracks so that you may find your way;",14,16,وَأَلْقَىٰ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ رَوَٰسِىَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ وَأَنْهَٰرًا وَسُبُلًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,He spread out mountains on earth to keep it firm so that it does not shake and cause you to become unsettled. He caused rivers to flow so that you can drink from them and give water to your livestock and crops. He split in it pathways for you to tread and reach your destinations without losing your way.
"As well as many other signs, as by the stars (you) find direction.",15,16,وَعَلَٰمَٰتٍ وَبِٱلنَّجْمِ هُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,He made for you on earth clear landmarks that you could be guided by when travelling during the day. He also made for you stars in the sky that you could use as a guide at night.
"So, could one who creates be like one who cannot? Will you not then contemplate?",16,16,أَفَمَن يَخْلُقُ كَمَن لَّا يَخْلُقُ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,Is the one who creates all these things like the one who does not create anything?! Do you not think about the greatness of Allah who created everything and worship Him alone without ascribing as partners to Him what has not created anything?
If you count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate. Assuredly God is forgiving and kind.,17,16,وَإِن تَعُدُّوا۟ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"If you - O people - tried to count and list Allah’s many blessings that He has favoured you with, you will not be able to do so because they are so numerous and diverse. Allah is Forgiving, as He did not take you to task for being neglectful of showing thanks to Him, and Merciful, as he did not stop these blessings from you on account of your sins and failure to thank Him."
God knows what you hide and disclose.,18,16,وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُسِرُّونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ,Allah knows the actions that you - O servants - conceal and those that you reveal. None of those actions are hidden from Him and He will recompense you for them.
", As for those they call besides God, they cannot create a thing, and have themselves been created.",19,16,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَخْلُقُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ,"Those whom the idolaters worship besides Allah, do not create anything no matter how little. Those who worship them besides Allah are the ones who make them. How do they worship besides Allah those idols which they make with their own hands?!"
"Dead, without life they are, and do not know when they will be raised.",20,16,أَمْوَٰتٌ غَيْرُ أَحْيَآءٍ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ,"Despite the fact that the idol worshippers made their gods with their own hands, they are also lifeless things that have no life nor knowledge. They do not know when they will be resurrected with their worshippers on the Day of Judgement, to be thrown together with them into the fire of Hell."
"Your God is one God. But the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come are filled with denial, and they are puffed up with pride.",21,16,إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ قُلُوبُهُم مُّنكِرَةٌ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"The only being that truly deserves to be worshipped is only one being who has no partner and that is Allah. Those who deny the resurrection and the recompense, their hearts are arrogant and they do not fear the reckoning. They therefore do not believe that there will be any reckoning or retribution. They are arrogant and refuse to accept the truth."
Surely God knows what they hide and what they disclose. He certainly does not love the proud.,22,16,لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْتَكْبِرِينَ,"Truly, Allah knows the actions that these people conceal and He knows the actions they reveal. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will recompense them for that. He, may He be glorified, does not love those who are too proud to worship and submit to Him. Instead he detests such people intensely."
"For when they are asked: ""What has your Lord sent down?"" they say: ""Tales of long ago.""",23,16,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُم مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,When these people who deny the oneness of the Creator and who reject the resurrection are asked: What did Allah reveal to Muhammad (peace be upon him)? They say: He did not reveal anything to him. It is only that he himself has brought stories and fables of the earlier ones.
"On the Day of Resurrection they will carry their own burden and some of the load of those they have led astray without any knowledge. Oh, how evil a burden they will carry!",24,16,لِيَحْمِلُوٓا۟ أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ أَلَا سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,"So that their outcome will be that they will bear their sins without any reduction, and they will also bear some of the sins of those they misled from Islam on account of ignorance and blind imitation. How terrible will be that which they will carry from their own sins and the sins of their followers."
"Those who have gone before them had also conspired; then God uprooted their structure from its foundation; the roof fell over them from above, and punishment came upon them from somewhere they did not suspect.",25,16,قَدْ مَكَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَى ٱللَّهُ بُنْيَٰنَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلسَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَىٰهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,The disbelievers before these people devised plots against their Messengers. Allah then destroyed their buildings from the foundations and as a result their roofs fell on them from above. The punishment came to them from where they did not expect as they had expected their buildings to protect them but they were destroyed by them.
"On the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and ask: ""Where are My compeers for whom you contended?"" Those endowed with knowledge will say: ""Shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today.""",26,16,ثُمَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يُخْزِيهِمْ وَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآءِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تُشَٰٓقُّونَ فِيهِمْ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ إِنَّ ٱلْخِزْىَ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَٱلسُّوٓءَ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,Then on the Day of Judgment Allah will humiliate and disgrace them with His punishment and He will say to them: Where are my partners whom you used to associate with me in worship and because of which you used to oppose the prophets and the believers? Those who were righteous scholars will then say:: Indeed! Humilation and torment on this Day will necessarily cover the disbelievers.
"They whose souls are drawn out by the angels while they are sinning, shall offer submission: ""We did no evil."" But God knows well what you did.",27,16,ٱلَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّىٰهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ ظَالِمِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ فَأَلْقَوُا۟ ٱلسَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوٓءٍۭ بَلَىٰٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Those whose souls are taken by the angel of death and his aides while wronging themselves in their disbelief will submit with full surrender when death actually comes to them, and they will deny the disbelief and sins they used to do, thinking that such denial will be of benefit to them. It will be said to them: You have lied. You were disbelievers who used to commit sin. Allah knows everything that you used to do in the world. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will recompense you for that."
"So enter the gates of Hell, and dwell there for ever. How dreadful a dwelling for the haughty!",28,16,فَٱدْخُلُوٓا۟ أَبْوَٰبَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا فَلَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,It will be said to them: Enter in accordance with your deeds through the doors of Hell to live therein forever. What an evil place of residence for those who were too arrogant to have faith in Allah and worship Him alone.
"When those who took heed for themselves would be asked: ""What did your Lord send down?"" They will answer: ""The best."" For those who do good there is good in the world, but certainly the abode of the next is better. How excellent the home of the virtuous!",29,16,وَقِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ مَاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوا۟ خَيْرًا لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ وَلَدَارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ وَلَنِعْمَ دَارُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Yet those who were mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions were asked: What did your Lord send down to your Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)? They replied: Allah has sent down on him great good. For those who worshipped Allah well and treated His creation well in this worldly life there is an excellent reward including victory and abundance of sustenance. And the reward that Allah has prepared for them in the Hearafter will be better then what He has already given them in the world. What an excellent home is the home of the afterlife for those who are mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions!
They will enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they wish. Thus will the pious and devout be rewarded.,30,16,جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ كَذَٰلِكَ يَجْزِى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"They will enter gardens of residence and permanence with rivers flowing below their palaces and trees. In these gardens they will have every type of food, drink and other pleasures that they desire. This type of reward, which He gives to those who are mindful from the nation of Muhammad (peace be upon him), He also gives to those who were mindful from the previous communities."
"When the angels receive the souls of those who are blameless they will say: ""Peace on you. Enter Paradise as recompense for what you did.""",31,16,ٱلَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّىٰهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ طَيِّبِينَ يَقُولُونَ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Those whose souls are taken by the angel of death and his aides while their hearts were free from disbelief, the angels will address them saying: Peace be on you. You are safe from every difficulty. Enter paradise because of the correct belief and good actions that you used to do in the world."
"What! Do the (unbelievers) expect that the angels should descend, or the sentence of your Lord come to pass? So had the people done before them; yet God did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.",32,16,هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّآ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِىَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ كَذَٰلِكَ فَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Are these denying idolaters waiting for anything but the angel of death and his aides to come to take their souls and strike their faces and their backs, or for Allah’s command to come to eradicate them by means of a punishment in the world? Similar to those idolaters who came before who were destroyed because if their idolatry; so too the idolaters of Makkah may perhaps meet the same fate. Allah did not wrong them when He destroyed them but they wronged their own souls by bringing them to the point of destruction because of their disbelief in Allah."
"The evil they perpetrated overtook them, and what they mocked has turned upon them.",33,16,فَأَصَابَهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتُ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,So the retribution of the actions they used to do came down on them and they were surrounded by the punishment they used to mock at whenever they were reminded of it.
"The idolaters say: ""If God had willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him, nor would our fathers have done, nor would we have forbidden any thing without His (leave)."" So had the people done before them. Therefore it is binding on the prophets to convey the message in clearest terms.",34,16,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا عَبَدْنَا مِن دُونِهِۦ مِن شَىْءٍ نَّحْنُ وَلَآ ءَابَآؤُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِن دُونِهِۦ مِن شَىْءٍ كَذَٰلِكَ فَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَهَلْ عَلَى ٱلرُّسُلِ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"Those who associated others with Allah in their worship said: Had Allah willed for us to worship Him alone and not to ascribe any partners to Him, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, neither us, nor our ancestors before us. Had He willed for us not to prohibit anything we would not have done so. The disbelievers of the past also presented such false arguments. The duty of the Messengers is only to clearly communicate what they have been instructed to convey and they have done so. The disbelievers cannot present fate as an argument after Allah has given them free will and choice and sent to them His Messengers."
"To every community We have sent an apostle. (saying:) ""Worship God, and keep away from all other deities."" Thus some of them were guided by God, and ruin was justified on some. Travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused (the apostles) of lies.",35,16,وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ ٱلطَّٰغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةُ فَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"We had sent to every previous nation a Messenger instructing his nation to worship Allah alone, and leave the worship of others beside Him such as idols, satans etc. Some of them were guided by Allah and had faith in Him, while others rejected Allah and went against His Messenger so He did not guide them and they deserved misguidance. So travel through the earth to see for yourselves what the end result of the deniers was after the punishment and destruction came upon them."
"Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray: They will have no one to help them.",36,16,إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَىٰ هُدَىٰهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"Even though you - O Messenger - try everything you can to call these people being so eager for their guidance, Allah will not guide those whom He misguides and they will have none besides Allah to assist them by protecting them from the punishment."
"They swear emphatically in the name of God that God will not raise the dead. On the contrary, it is a promise incumbent on Him, though most men do not understand,",37,16,وَأَقْسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ لَا يَبْعَثُ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَمُوتُ بَلَىٰ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"These deniers swore their most serious oaths: Allah will not resurrect anyone who dies, without their having any proof of that. Yes indeed, Allah will resurrect everyone who dies, being His binding promise, because the one who brought them to life from non-existence without any precedent is able to bring them back to life after having caused them to die. But most people do not know that Allah will resurrect the dead and they therefore deny the resurrection."
"For (they fear) He might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars.",38,16,لِيُبَيِّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى يَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ كَٰذِبِينَ,"Allah will resurrect them all on the Day of Judgement to make clear to them the things they differed about such as His Oneness, the resurrection and prophethood and so that the disbelievers may realise that they were false in their claim of Allah’s having partners and in their denial of the resurrection."
"Yet when We will a thing We have only to say: ""Be"", and it is.",39,16,إِنَّمَا قَوْلُنَا لِشَىْءٍ إِذَآ أَرَدْنَٰهُ أَن نَّقُولَ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"Indeed when I want to bring the dead to life and ressurect them then there will be nothing to prevent Me from doing so. When We will something to happen, all that We say is, ‘Be,’ and it definitely becomes."
"Those who left their homes in the cause of God after having been oppressed, will be given by Us a better place in the world, and if they knew, the guerdon of the next would be greater",40,16,وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ فِى ٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُوا۟ لَنُبَوِّئَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَلَأَجْرُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Those who left their homes, families and wealth emigrating from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam in search for Allah’s pleasure after having been persecuted by the disbelievers, we will make them settle in the world in a place in which they will be honoured. But the reward of the afterlife is greater because it includes paradise. If those who remained behind from emigration knew the reward of those who emigrate they would not have remained behind."
(For) those who persevere and place their trust in their Lord.,41,16,ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,These emigrants in Allah’s way are the ones who were patient against the harm of their people and the separation from their families and homes. They were steadfast in Allah’s obedience. They rely only on their Lord in all their affairs and Allah therefore gave them this great reward.
"We sent before you none (as apostles) but men, to whom We sent revelations. In case you are unaware, enquire of those who are keepers of the Oracles of God.",42,16,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُّوحِىٓ إِلَيْهِمْ فَسْـَٔلُوٓا۟ أَهْلَ ٱلذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"I did not send before you - O Messenger - except men who were human beings, to whom I sent revelation. I did not send Messengers that were angels. This is Our constant practice. If you all deny that then ask the people of the previous scriptures and they will tell you that Messengers were on;y human beings."
We had Sent them with miracles and Books; and We have sent to you this Reminder so that you may explain distinctly to men what was sent down to them: They may haply reflect.,43,16,بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"We sent those Messengers from amongst humans with clear signs and revealed scriptures. We have revealed to you, O Messenger, the Qur’ān so that you can give people the explanation they require and so that they can apply their minds and take a lesson from what it contains."
"Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them, or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not (even) suspect?",44,16,أَفَأَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مَكَرُوا۟ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ أَن يَخْسِفَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"Do those who make plots to prevent people from Allah’s path feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with them as He caused it to cave in with Qarun, or that the punishment will not come to them from where they least expect."
"Or that He will not seize them as they move about, and they will not be able to elude (His grasp);",45,16,أَوْ يَأْخُذَهُمْ فِى تَقَلُّبِهِمْ فَمَا هُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,Or that the punishment will not afflict them whilst they are going about on their journeys and in their quest for earnings. They will not escape nor protect themselves from it.
Or He may seize them by diminishing their portion. Yet your Lord is compassionate and kind.,46,16,أَوْ يَأْخُذَهُمْ عَلَىٰ تَخَوُّفٍ فَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Or do they feel secure that Allah’s punishment will not come to them while they are afraid of it? Allah is able to punish them in every condition. Your Lord is compassionate and merciful. He does not take retribution hastily for perhaps His servants will turn to Him in repentance.
"Do they not see the shadows of all things God has created incline to the right and the left, bowing in obeisance to God?",47,16,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّؤُا۟ ظِلَٰلُهُۥ عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَٱلشَّمَآئِلِ سُجَّدًا لِّلَّهِ وَهُمْ دَٰخِرُونَ,"Do these deniers not look with contemplation at His creation? Their shadows incline right and left following the movement of the sun in the day and that of the moon at night, in humility and prostration to their Lord, whilst they are submissive to Allah and are subject to His domination."
"All things that move on the earth and in the heavens, and the angels, bow in homage to God, and do not behave with pride.",48,16,وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,It is to Allah alone that all creatures in the heavens and on earth prostrate. It is to Him alone that the angels prostrate. They are not too proud to worship Allah and obey Him.
"They have fear of God for His power over them, and act as commanded.",49,16,يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ,"They - despite their constant worship and obedience - fear their Lord who is above them by His Self, Dominance and Authority and they carry out the acts of obedience that their Lord instructs them to."
"God says: ""Do not take to two gods, for there is only one God. So fear Me.""",50,16,وَقَالَ ٱللَّهُ لَا تَتَّخِذُوٓا۟ إِلَٰهَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَإِيَّٰىَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,"Allah, may He be glorified, said to all His servants: Do not take two beings of worship. The being deserving of worship is only one who has no second nor any partner. So fear Me only and do not fear others besides Me."
"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and His the judgement for ever. So will you fear any other than God?",51,16,وَلَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَهُ ٱلدِّينُ وَاصِبًا أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَتَّقُونَ,"To Him alone belongs everything in the heavens and on earth: He created, owns and controls all of it. To Him alone obedience, submission and sincerity is due always. Will you, then, fear anyone other than Allah?  No, instead fear Him alone!"
"Whatsoever the blessings you enjoy are surely from God, and when in trouble you turn to Him in supplication.",52,16,وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْـَٔرُونَ,"Whatever blessing you - O people - have in this world or in the afterlife is from Allah, may He be glorified, and not from anyone else. Then when some calamity, sickness or poverty afflicts you, it is to Him alone that you plead in supplication to remove what has afflicted you. Thus, the One who grants blessings and who removes difficulties is the One Who must be worshipped alone."
"Yet when He has delivered you from affliction, some of you ascribe companions to your Lord",53,16,ثُمَّ إِذَا كَشَفَ ٱلضُّرَّ عَنكُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنكُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,"Then when He answers your prayer and removes the harm from you, a group of you begin associating partners with their Lord and worshipping others with Him. What unjust behaviour is this!"
"So as to deny what We have bestowed on them. Well, enjoy yourselves, you will come to know soon.",54,16,لِيَكْفُرُوا۟ بِمَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ فَتَمَتَّعُوا۟ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Their associating partners with Allah meant that they in fact reject Allah’s favours to them, including Allah saving them from their distress after they had called on Him alone. It was therefore said to them: Enjoy the luxuries that you have until Allah’s penalty comes to you sooner or later."
"They set aside a portion of the food We have given them for those they do not know. By God, you will surely have to answer for all you contrive!",55,16,وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ نَصِيبًا مِّمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ تَٱللَّهِ لَتُسْـَٔلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنتُمْ تَفْتَرُونَ,"The idolaters allocate to their idols, which do not know anything - as they are lifeless objects that can neither benefit nor harm - a portion of the wealth that We provided for them, as a means of seeking closeness to those idols. By Allah, you - O idolaters - will be questioned on the Day of Judgement about your assertions that these idols are gods and that they are entitled to a portion of your wealth."
"They attribute daughters to God, the glorious, but for themselves whatsoever they please.",56,16,وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْبَنَٰتِ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَلَهُم مَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,"The idolaters attribute daughters to Allah and they believe that these are the angels. Thus they attribute lineage to Allah and select for him what they do not like for themselves. He is Pure, Glorified and Sanctified from what they assign to Him. They assign for themselves the male offspring that they desire. What crime is greater than this?!"
"Yet when news of the birth of a daughter reaches one of them, his face is darkened, and he is overwhelmed with silent grief,",57,16,وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِٱلْأُنثَىٰ ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُۥ مُسْوَدًّا وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"When one of these idolaters is given the news of the birth of a female his face darkens due to the extreme dislike of such news and his heart is filled with worry and grief. Then, he attributes to Allah what he does not like for himself!"
"And hides from people for shame at the news, (at a loss) whether he should keep her with shame, or bury her in the ground. How bad is the judgement that they make!",58,16,يَتَوَٰرَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ مِن سُوٓءِ مَا بُشِّرَ بِهِۦٓ أَيُمْسِكُهُۥ عَلَىٰ هُونٍ أَمْ يَدُسُّهُۥ فِى ٱلتُّرَابِ أَلَا سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,"He hides from his people because of the bad news of the birth of a girl that was given to him. He asks himself: Shall he keep this girl that he was given news of with humiliation and dejection, or shall he bury her alive and hide her in the dust? How evil is the decision that the idolaters make when they assigned to their Lord what they detest for themselves."
"The semblance of those who believe not in the life to come is that of the meanest; but the semblance of God is the most sublime, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.",59,16,لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مَثَلُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَثَلُ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"It is those who do not believe in the Hereafter who have a lower description; such as ignorance, disbelief, as well as the need to have offspring. Allah has the praiseworthy attributes of majesty, perfection, independence and knowledge. He, may He be glorified, is Mighty in His kingdom and nothing can overcome Him. He is Wise in His creation, planning and legislation."
"If God were to punish men for their inequity He would not leave a single moving thing on earth. Yet He gives them latitude for a time ordained. When that time is come, there will not be a moment's delay nor a moment's haste.",60,16,وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِظُلْمِهِم مَّا تَرَكَ عَلَيْهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"If Allah, may He be glorified, were to punish mankind for their injustices and for their rejection of Him, He would not leave on earth a single human being or animal that walks on its surface. But He, may He be glorified, postpones them until a time that is fixed in His knowledge. Then, when that time that is fixed in His knowledge comes, they will not delay it nor will they advance it for even a short while."
"Yet they attribute to God what they find detestable; and their tongues assert the lie that for them is only good. On the contrary, there is Fire for them, and they will be thrown into it.",61,16,وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ مَا يَكْرَهُونَ وَتَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُهُمُ ٱلْكَذِبَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَأَنَّهُم مُّفْرَطُونَ,"They assign to Allah, may He be glorified, females that they dislike to attribute to themselves. They claim falsely that if indeed they are resurrected then they will have the best ranks with Allah. Truly, for them is the Fire, and they will be left therein never to come out of it."
"By God, We sent apostles to many a people before you, but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them, and he is their friend this day, and a painful torment awaits them.",62,16,تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ فَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"By Allah, We sent Messengers to communities before you - O Messenger, but Satan made their evil deeds of idolatry, disbelief and sins seem good to them. He is their so-called helper on the Day of Judgement so let them ask him for help. They will have a painful punishment of the Day of Judgement."
"We have sent down this Book to you that you may explain to them what it is that they are differing about, and as guidance and a grace for those who believe.",63,16,وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ إِلَّا لِتُبَيِّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"We did not reveal the Qur’ān to you, O Messenger, except for you to make clear to all people what they differ about in respect of Allah’s oneness, resurrection and the details of the sacred law, and for the Qur’ān to be a guidance and mercy for those who have faith in Allah, His Messengers and all what the Qur’ān came with, for they are the ones who will truly benefit."
God sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth. Here is a sign for those who listen.,64,16,وَٱللَّهُ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,"Allah sends down rain from the direction of the sky, with which He revives the earth by taking out vegetation from it after it had been dry and arid. In the sending down of the rain from the direction of the sky and in the taking out of the earth’s vegetation by means of it, is a clear sign of Allah’s power for people who listen to the words of Allah and ponder over them."
And surely in cattle there is a lesson for you: We give you a drink from the extract of food in their bellies and blood-purest milk so delicious to drink;,65,16,وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُم مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهِۦ مِنۢ بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَنًا خَالِصًا سَآئِغًا لِّلشَّٰرِبِينَ,"There is a lesson for you to take - O people - in camels, cows and goats: We give you to drink from their udders milk that comes out from in between the waste that the stomach contains and the blood that is in the body. Despite this it comes out as pure milk that is tasty and pleasant to those who drink it."
"And in fruits of the date-palm and the vine, from which you obtain inebriating drinks and excellent food. In this indeed are signs for those who understand.",66,16,وَمِن ثَمَرَٰتِ ٱلنَّخِيلِ وَٱلْأَعْنَٰبِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَرًا وَرِزْقًا حَسَنًا إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"There is a lesson for you in the provision We give you from the fruits of date palms and grapes. From them you make intoxicants that affect the mind, which are not good, and you also take from them a good provision that is of benefit to you such as dates, raisins, vinegar and trickle. In this there truly is a sign of Allah’s power and favour to His servants for people who use their reason, for they are the ones who take heed."
"Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains, trees and trellices,",67,16,وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى ٱلنَّحْلِ أَنِ ٱتَّخِذِى مِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ ٱلشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, inspired the bees and guided them saying, “Make homes for yourselves in the mountains, in the trees and in the structures and shelters that people build.”"
And suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their Lord. A drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men. In this is a sign for those who reflect.,68,16,ثُمَّ كُلِى مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ فَٱسْلُكِى سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلًا يَخْرُجُ مِنۢ بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَٰنُهُۥ فِيهِ شِفَآءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"“Then eat of all the fruits you desire, and go along the pathways that your Lord inspires you to take that are made easy for you.” From the bellies of those bees emerges honey of different colours, such as white, yellow and other colours, which contains a cure for people that they can use to treat their sick. Surely in such inspiring of bees and in the honey that emerges from their bellies is a sign of Allah’s power and planning of the affairs of His creation for people who reflect, for they are the ones who take heed."
"It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful.",69,16,وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَفَّىٰكُمْ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰٓ أَرْذَلِ ٱلْعُمُرِ لِكَىْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ,"Allah created you without a precedent; then He will cause you to die when your term of life ends. The lifespan of some of you will be extended to the worst stage of life, which is the severe old-age, when a person will no longer know anything of what he used to know. Allah is knowing, and no action of His servants is hidden from Him. He is powerful and nothing can overpower Him."
God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence. But those who have been favoured with more do not give of their means to their dependents so that they may become equal with them. Do they then deny God's beneficence?,70,16,وَٱللَّهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِى ٱلرِّزْقِ فَمَا ٱلَّذِينَ فُضِّلُوا۟ بِرَآدِّى رِزْقِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, has given some of you preference over others in the provision that He has granted you and has made some you some of you rich and others poor, some of you leaders and others subjects. Those whom Allah has given preference in provision are not willing to pass on what Allah has given them to their servants, so that they become equal partners in the ownership thereof. How then are they pleased for Allah to have partners from amongst His servants when they are not pleased for themselves to have partners from amongst their servants who are equal to them? What injustice is this and what rejection of Allah’s favours can be worse than this?!"
"God has provided mates for you of your own kind, and has bestowed on you sons and daughters from your mates, and has given you good things for food. Will they even then believe in the false and deny God's grace?",71,16,وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُم بَنِينَ وَحَفَدَةً وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ أَفَبِٱلْبَٰطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ,"Allah has made for you - O people - spouses from your species whose company you can enjoy. He has made for you from your spouses children and grandchildren; and has provided you with wholesome foods such as meat, grains and fruit. Will they then believe in false idols and statues, and reject Allah's innumerable favours and not thank Him by having faith in Him alone?!"
"Yet they worship those apart from God who cannot provide for them any sustenance from the heavens or the earth, nor will they have power to do so.",72,16,وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ رِزْقًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,"These idolaters worship, besides Allah, idols who have no power to provide them with any provision from the heavens or the earth and they will never be able to do so because they are inanimate objects that have no life or knowledge."
"So do not invent similitudes for God. Indeed God knows, and you do not know.",73,16,فَلَا تَضْرِبُوا۟ لِلَّهِ ٱلْأَمْثَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,So - O People - do not make similarities for Allah from these idols that do not benefit nor harm. Allah has no likeness that you can associate with Him in worship. Allah knows the attributes of majesty and perfection that are His and you do not know that and as a result you ascribe partners to Him and claim that your idols are similar to Him.
"God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything, and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune, who spends from it in private and in public: Can they be equal? Praised be God! But most men do not understand.",74,16,ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا عَبْدًا مَّمْلُوكًا لَّا يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ وَمَن رَّزَقْنَٰهُ مِنَّا رِزْقًا حَسَنًا فَهُوَ يُنفِقُ مِنْهُ سِرًّا وَجَهْرًا هَلْ يَسْتَوُۥنَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, strikes an example to refute the idolaters: A bonded slave that is unable to do anything and who has nothing to spend as compared to a free person to whom We have given from our side lawful wealth that he uses as he wills and spends from it secretly and openly as he wills. These two men are not equal. How then do you make Allah who is the Owner of everything, who spends in His dominion and does what He wills, equal to those powerless idols? Praise be to Allah Who is deserving of all praise. Rather, most of the idolaters do not know that Allah is Single in His divinity and that He alone deserves to be worshipped."
"God presents another example of two men, one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent he returns without any good (result). Could he be equal to one who enjoins what is just, and follows the right path?",75,16,وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلَيْنِ أَحَدُهُمَآ أَبْكَمُ لَا يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ كَلٌّ عَلَىٰ مَوْلَىٰهُ أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ لَا يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى هُوَ وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Allah, may He be glorified, strikes another example to refute them, which is the example of two men: One of them is mute and cannot hear, speak or understand due to his deafness and muteness. He is unable to benefit himself or others. He is a heavy burden on the one who is in charge of and looks after him. Whichever direction he sends him, he brings no good and does not attain the objective. Can the person whose condition is like this be equal to one who is sound of hearing and speech, and who is of benefit to others. He instructs people to be just and he himself is upright. He is on a clear path that has no confusion or crookedness. How then do you - O idolater- equate Allah Who possesses the attributes of majesty and perfection with your idols who cannot hear or speak and who cannot bring any benefit or remove any harm?!"
"To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and the Hour of Doom is a matter of the winking of an eye, even less, for God has certainly power over all things.",76,16,وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَآ أَمْرُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ إِلَّا كَلَمْحِ ٱلْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"To Allah alone belongs the knowledge of the unseen of the heavens and knowledge of the unseen of the earth. He has the exclusive knowledge of that as opposed to anyone of His creation. The coming of the Hour is only known to Allah, and the speed of its coming is only like the closing and opening of the eyelid or closer then that. Allah has power over everything. Nothing can overpower Him. When He intends something He says, “Be” and it is."
"God produced you from your mothers' wombs knowing nothing, but gave you ears and eyes and hearts so that you may be grateful.",77,16,وَٱللَّهُ أَخْرَجَكُم مِّنۢ بُطُونِ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah brought you - O people - out of your mothers’ wombs after the completion of the term of pregnancy, as babies not realising anything; and He gave you hearing to hear with, eyesight to see with, and hearts to reason; in the hope that you may give thanks to Him for these favours that He has given you."
Do you not see the birds held high between the heavens and the earth? Nothing holds them (aloft) but God. There are verily signs in this for those who believe.,78,16,أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَى ٱلطَّيْرِ مُسَخَّرَٰتٍ فِى جَوِّ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Have the idolaters not seen the birds that are subdued and designed to fly in the air because of the wings that Allah granted them along with the lighteness and delicate nature of the air? He inspired them to close and open their wings. No one keeps them from falling in the air except Allah, the Powerful. In this subjugation and holding them from falling there are signs for people who have faith in Allah, because they are the ones who benefit from such signs and lessons."
"God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time.",79,16,وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنۢ بُيُوتِكُمْ سَكَنًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُم مِّن جُلُودِ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ بُيُوتًا تَسْتَخِفُّونَهَا يَوْمَ ظَعْنِكُمْ وَيَوْمَ إِقَامَتِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ أَثَٰثًا وَمَتَٰعًا إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Allah, may He be glorified, has made for you the homes that you build out of stone and other items to settle and rest therein. He has made for you, from the skins of camels, cows and goats, tents and canopies in the desert that are similar to urban homes. These are light for you to carry when you travel from one place to another and are easy to erect when you stop. He has made for you, from the wool of sheep and the hair of camels and goats, furnishings for your homes and garments and coverings that you can enjoy the use of until a specified time."
"God has given you of things created, shade, and places of shelter in the mountains, and clothes for protection against the heat, and coats (of mail) for defence during war. He thus bestows His favours on you so that you may be grateful to Him.",80,16,وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّمَّا خَلَقَ ظِلَٰلًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ أَكْنَٰنًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ سَرَٰبِيلَ تَقِيكُمُ ٱلْحَرَّ وَسَرَٰبِيلَ تَقِيكُم بَأْسَكُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ يُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْلِمُونَ,"Allah has made for you trees and buildings that you use as shade from the heat. He has made for you tunnels, caverns and caves in the mountains that you use as a cover from the cold, heat and from enemies. He has made for you shirts and clothing of cotton that protect you from the heat and cold. He has made for you armour that protect you from the violence of others in war so that the weapons do not penetrate and reach your bodies. Just as Allah has given you the above favours He completes His favours to you in the hope that you will submit to Allah alone and not associate anything as partner to Him."
"If they still turn away, your duty is to warn them in clear terms.",81,16,فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"If they turn away from faith and acceptance of what you have brought, then your duty, O Messenger, is only to convey what you have been instructed to in a clear manner. It is not your duty to make them accept guidance."
"They do know the favours of God, and yet they deny them, for most of them are not grateful.",82,16,يَعْرِفُونَ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنكِرُونَهَا وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"The idolaters recognise the favours that Allah has given them, such as the sending of the prophet (peace be upon him), but then they deny His favours by not giving thanks and by rejecting His Messenger. Most of them reject His favours, may He be glorified."
"The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.",83,16,وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْذَنُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَلَا هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,"Remember, O Messenger, the Day when Allah will raise up from every nation their Messenger who was sent to them to give testimony of the faith of those who believed and the rejection of those who disbelieved. Thereafter those who disbelieved will not be allowed to present an excuse for their rejection and they will not be returned to the world to do actions pleasing to their Lord, as the afterlife is the place of reckoning and not the place of action."
"And when the wicked shall face the torment it will not be decreased, nor will they be reprieved.",84,16,وَإِذَا رَءَا ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"When the wrongdoers and idolaters will see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them and they will not be given respite by it being delayed from them. Instead, they will enter it to live in it forever."
"When the idolaters see their partners they will call out: ""O our Lord, these are the partners we invoked instead of You;"" but they will retort: ""You are liars.""",85,16,وَإِذَا رَءَا ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ شُرَكَآءَهُمْ قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ شُرَكَآؤُنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كُنَّا نَدْعُوا۟ مِن دُونِكَ فَأَلْقَوْا۟ إِلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ إِنَّكُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"When the idolaters in the afterlife will see the false deities that they used to worship besides Allah, they will say: “O our Lord! These are our partners that we used to worship besides You.” They will say this to make them carry their burdens. Allah will cause their deities to speak and they will respond to them saying: You - O idolaters - were false in your worship of a partner with Allah, for He has no partner deserving of worship."
"They will offer submission to God that Day, and the lies they fabricated will not be of the least avail.",86,16,وَأَلْقَوْا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,The idolaters will surrender and submit to Allah alone and all their fabricated claims that their idols will intercede for them before Allah will disappear.
"For those who deny the truth and obstruct (others) from the way of God, We shall add torment to torment as they were perpetrating corruption.",87,16,ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ زِدْنَٰهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يُفْسِدُونَ,"Those who disbelieved and turned others away from the Religion of Allah will have their punishment increased above and beyond what was due to them from their own disbelief, but because they misguiding others also."
"Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit.",88,16,وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ شَهِيدًا عَلَىٰ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ تِبْيَٰنًا لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, the day when we will raise in every nation a Messenger who will testify against them about their denial or their acceptance of faith. This Messenger will be from their ownselves and will speak their language. We have brought you, O Messenger, as a witness against all communities. We revealed the Qur’ān to you to clarify everything that requires clarification such as the lawful and unlawful, reward and punishment etc. We also revealed it as a guidance for people to the truth, as a mercy to those who have faith in it and practice what it contains, and as good news for those who have faith in Allah of the everlasting bliss that awaits them."
"Verily God has enjoined justice, the doing of good, and the giving of gifts to your relatives; and forbidden indecency, impropriety and oppression. He warns you so that you may remember.",89,16,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱلْإِحْسَٰنِ وَإِيتَآئِ ذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَيَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنكَرِ وَٱلْبَغْىِ يَعِظُكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Allah instructs His servants to be just, by discharging Allah’s rights and the rights of fellow human beings and by not giving preference in judgement to anyone unless with a right that demands such preference. He instructs them to be good, by doing more than what is mandatory such as spending voluntarily and forgiving the oppressor. He instructs them to see to the needs of their relatives. He forbids everything that is vile, in words, such as obscene speech, or in deeds, such as fornication. He forbids oppression and arrogance over people. Allah advises you with the instructions and prohibitions in this verse in the hope that you will take heed of His advice."
"Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do.",90,16,وَأَوْفُوا۟ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ إِذَا عَٰهَدتُّمْ وَلَا تَنقُضُوا۟ ٱلْأَيْمَٰنَ بَعْدَ تَوْكِيدِهَا وَقَدْ جَعَلْتُمُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيْكُمْ كَفِيلًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ,"Fulfil every pledge that you made to Allah or that you made to people. Do not break oaths after making them binding by swearing by Allah, when you have made Allah a witness to the oath that you swore. Allah knows what you do. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will recompense you for that."
And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread. Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you. God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about.,91,16,وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّتِى نَقَضَتْ غَزْلَهَا مِنۢ بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ أَنكَٰثًا تَتَّخِذُونَ أَيْمَٰنَكُمْ دَخَلًۢا بَيْنَكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ أُمَّةٌ هِىَ أَرْبَىٰ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ إِنَّمَا يَبْلُوكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ وَلَيُبَيِّنَنَّ لَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Do not be, by breaking your oaths, foolish and dim-witted like a woman who tired herself by spinning her wool and after it was firmly spun she broke it open and unravelled it!. She tired herself by spinning it and then breaking it and she didnt obtain the desired result. You make your oaths as a means of deception to deceive one another, so that your nation can be more in number and stronger than the nation of your enemies. Allah only tests you by the fulfilment of your oaths - will you fulfil them or break them? Allah will make clear to you on the Day of Judgement those things you differed about in the world and He will distinguish those who were on truth from those who were on falsehood and the truthful from the liars."
"If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.",92,16,وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَلَٰكِن يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَلَتُسْـَٔلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation in agreement on the truth, but He, may He be glorified, misguides whom He wills from the truth and from fulfilling their oaths by His justice, and He guides whom He wills to do so by His grace. You will surely be questioned on the Day of Judgement about what you used to do in the world."
"So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment.",93,16,وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَكُمْ دَخَلًۢا بَيْنَكُمْ فَتَزِلَّ قَدَمٌۢ بَعْدَ ثُبُوتِهَا وَتَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلسُّوٓءَ بِمَا صَدَدتُّمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَكُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Do not make your oaths a means of deception thereby allowing you to trick and deceive one another, following your desires - breaking them whenever you wish and fulfilling them when you wish. If you do so your feet will slip from the straight path after being firm on it. You will taste the punishment on account of your deviation from Allah’s path and your misleading others from it and you will receive multiplied punishment."
"And do not trade God's covenant for a paltry price. Remember, what is with God is better for you, if only you knew!",94,16,وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا۟ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا إِنَّمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Do not exchange the oath you took in Allah’s name for a small amount, not fulfilling the pledge or not being sincere in it. The victory and booty that Allah has in the world and the perpetual bliss that He has in the afterlife is better for you than the small amount that you take for breaking the pledge, if only you knew that."
"For what you possess will pass, but what is with God will abide. We shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds.",95,16,مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَاقٍ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوٓا۟ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"The wealth, pleasures and luxuries that you have - O people - will come to an end no matter how much it may be, but the reward that is with Allah will remain. How then do you give preference to that which is perishable over that which is lasting? We will certainly reward those who remain steadfast on their oaths and who do not break them according to the best of their good deeds by multiplying its reward by ten times up to seven hundred times or even more."
"We shall invest whosoever works for good, whether man or woman, with a pleasant life, and reward them in accordance with the best of what they have done.",96,16,مَنْ عَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُۥ حَيَوٰةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Whoever does good deeds in accordance with the sacred law, whether male or female, while having faith in Allah, We will grant them in this world a good life, by their being pleased with Allah’s decree, content and guided towards righteous actions, and We will reward them in the afterlife in accordance with the best good deeds that they used to do in the world."
"So, when you recite the Qur'an seek refuge in God from Satan the execrable.",97,16,فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ,"When you intend to recite the Qur’ān - O believer - then ask Allah to protect you from the whispering of the Satan, who is rejected from Allah’s mercy."
He does not have power over those who believe and place their trust in their Lord.,98,16,إِنَّهُۥ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ سُلْطَٰنٌ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,Satan has no authority over those who have faith in Allah and who rely only on their Lord in all their affairs.
"His power is only over those who take him as their patron, and those who ascribe equals (to God).",99,16,إِنَّمَا سُلْطَٰنُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِهِۦ مُشْرِكُونَ,He only has authority by means of His whispering over those who take him as an ally and follow him in his luring and those who because of such luring associate partners with Allah whom they worship along with Him.
"When We replace a message with another -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say: ""You have made it up;"" yet most of them do not know.",100,16,وَإِذَا بَدَّلْنَآ ءَايَةً مَّكَانَ ءَايَةٍ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يُنَزِّلُ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُفْتَرٍۭ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"When We abrogate the ruling of one verse of the Qur’ān with another verse - and Allah knows well about the part of the Qur’ān that is abrogated for a reason and the part that is not abrogated - they say: You, O Muhammad, are only a liar making up things about Allah. Rather, most of them do not know that abrogation occurs for a divine reason with far-reaching wisdom."
"You say: ""It has been sent by divine grace from your Lord with truth to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance and good news for those who have submitted (to God).""",101,16,قُلْ نَزَّلَهُۥ رُوحُ ٱلْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"Say to them, O Messenger, This Qur’ān has been brought down by Gabriel (peace be with him) from Allah, may He be glorified, with the truth that contains no error, alteration or distortion, to keep those who have faith in Allah firm on their faith, whether a new part is revealed or a part is abrogated, and to be a guidance for them to the truth and good news for the Muslims about the generous reward that they will obtain."
"Yet We know what they say: ""It is only a man who instructs him."" The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic.",102,16,وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ إِنَّمَا يُعَلِّمُهُۥ بَشَرٌ لِّسَانُ ٱلَّذِى يُلْحِدُونَ إِلَيْهِ أَعْجَمِىٌّ وَهَٰذَا لِسَانٌ عَرَبِىٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"I know very well that the idolaters say: It is a human being who is teaching Muhammad (peace be upon him). They are lying in this claim of theirs. The language of the person whom they assume is teaching him is non-Arabic, whereas this Qur’ān has been revealed in the clear and highly eloquent Arabic language. How then do they claim that he received it from a non-Arab?!"
Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God. For them is severe punishment.,103,16,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَهْدِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who do not believe that the verses of the Qur’ān are in fact from Allah, may He be glorified, Allah does not bless them with guidance as long as they persist in that. They will receive a painful punishment on account of their rejection of Allah and denial of His verses."
"They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God, and they are liars.",104,16,إِنَّمَا يَفْتَرِى ٱلْكَذِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَٰذِبُونَ,"Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not lying about what he brought from His Lord. Lies are only being invented by those who do not accept Allah’s words, because they do not fear any punishment nor have hope of any reward. Those described with the attribute of disbelief are the liars as lying is a habit that they are accustomed to."
"Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,",105,16,مَن كَفَرَ بِٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ إِيمَٰنِهِۦٓ إِلَّا مَنْ أُكْرِهَ وَقَلْبُهُۥ مُطْمَئِنٌّۢ بِٱلْإِيمَٰنِ وَلَٰكِن مَّن شَرَحَ بِٱلْكُفْرِ صَدْرًا فَعَلَيْهِمْ غَضَبٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Whoever denies Allah after having faith in Him is in one of two situations: His denial is by means of a statement or action that he was coerced to make or do, whilst his heart is firm on his faith. This person is a believer. The second situation is when the person is content with and comfortable with such denial. Such a person and others like him are apostates from Islam, the anger of Allah is on them and in the afterlife they will receive a great punishment."
For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide those who do not believe.,106,16,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمُ ٱسْتَحَبُّوا۟ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا عَلَى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Such apostasy from Islam is because they gave preference to the trivial things of this world as a benefit for their disbelief in the Hearafter and because Allah does not guide to faith people who disbelieve, but He abandons them."
They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God; and these are the heedless.,107,16,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰفِلُونَ,"Those described as being apostates after having faith are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed, so they do not understand the admonition, He has sealed their hearing, so that they do not hear anything that benefits them, and He has sealed their sight, so that they do not see the signs indicating faith. It is they who are unaware of the causes of happiness and wretchedness and of the punishment that Allah has prepared for them."
"They will surely be losers in the life to come,",108,16,لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Truly it is they who will be the losers on the Day of Judgement, for they have lost their own souls on account of their disbelief after faith. Had they held onto their faith they would have entered paradise."
"But (to) those who were victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently, your Lord will surely be forgiving and kind.",109,16,ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا فُتِنُوا۟ ثُمَّ جَٰهَدُوا۟ وَصَبَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Then your Lord - O Messenger - is Forgiving and Merciful towards those oppressed believers who migrated from Makkah to Madina after being persecuted by the idolaters to the extent that they uttered words of disbelief whilst their hearts were at peace with faith. Then they strove in Allah’s path to make the Word of Allah supreme, and the word of the disbelievers lowest and they were patient over its difficulties. Your Lord, after the persecution that they underwent, is Forgiving and Merciful towards them because they only uttered words of disbelief under duress."
"On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be recompensed for what it had done, no one will be wronged.",110,16,يَوْمَ تَأْتِى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ تُجَٰدِلُ عَن نَّفْسِهَا وَتُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"Remember - O Messenger - the Day when every person will come arguing for himself. He will not argue for anyone else due to the magnitude of the situation. Every soul will be given in full the recompense for what it had done, whether good or bad, and they will not be wronged by any subtraction from their good actions or addition to their evil actions."
"God presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security, its provisions coming from everywhere in abundance, but it denied the favours of God; so God acquainted it with intimate hunger and fear (as punishment) for what they had done.",111,16,وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ ءَامِنَةً مُّطْمَئِنَّةً يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًا مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ فَكَفَرَتْ بِأَنْعُمِ ٱللَّهِ فَأَذَٰقَهَا ٱللَّهُ لِبَاسَ ٱلْجُوعِ وَٱلْخَوْفِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَصْنَعُونَ,"Allah cites the example of a town - which is Makkah - that was secure and stable with its people having no fear, whilst people around it lived in fear. Its sustenance comes to it abundantly and easily from every direction. But then its people became unappreciative of Allah's blessings to them and they did not thank Him, so Allah recompensed them with hunger and intense fear that was visible in the panic on their faces and emaciation in their bodies to the extent that this became like a garment for them on account of the disbelief and denial that they used to do."
"An apostle came to them who was one of them, but they called him a liar. Then they were seized by torment for they were sinners.",112,16,وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"And a Messenger from among them, whose honesty and truthfulness they knew - who was Muhammad (peace be upon him) - had come to the people of Makka, but they denounced him along with what Allah had revealed to him. As a result, Allah’s punishment of hunger and fear came on them whilst they were wronging their own souls by associating partners with Allah and rejecting His Messenger."
"Eat the good and lawful of things that God has given you, and be grateful for the bounty of God, if you really worship Him.",113,16,فَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَٰلًا طَيِّبًا وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,"So eat - O people - of the lawful and wholesome things that Allah, may He be glorified, has provided for you, and be thankful for the blessings Allah has given you by acknowledging these blessings of His and using them to seek His pleasure, if it is Him that you worship alone without associating partners with Him."
"He has forbidden carrion and blood and the flesh of the swine, and what has been killed in the name of any other but God; but if one is driven by necessity (to eat it) without craving or reverting to it, then God is forgiving and kind.",114,16,إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلَا عَادٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah has made unlawful for you to consume that which died without being slaughtered according to the sacred law, blood that spills forth from an animal at the time of slaughter, all parts of the pig, and what was slaughtered by a person as an offering to other than Allah. This prohibition applies at the time when a person has a choice.If someone is compelled to eat any of these forbidden types, and does so without desiring the forbidden thing itself and without going beyond the limit of what is necessary, then they have done no wrong. Allah is Forgiving and will forgive them for what they consume. He is Merciful in that He permitted that when it is necessary."
"Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: ""This is lawful, and this is forbidden,"" in order to impute lies to God; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment.",115,16,وَلَا تَقُولُوا۟ لِمَا تَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُكُمُ ٱلْكَذِبَ هَٰذَا حَلَٰلٌ وَهَٰذَا حَرَامٌ لِّتَفْتَرُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ,"Do not say - O idolaters - about the lies that you say about Allah's laws: This thing is lawful and this thing is unlawful, in order to invent lies and attribute them to Allah with respect to making unlawful what He did not make unlawful, or making lawful what He did not make lawful. Those who invent lies about Allah will not succeed in attaining their objective and they will not be saved from what they fear."
"For them there is some enjoyment, but the punishment is painful.",116,16,مَتَٰعٌ قَلِيلٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,They will have a brief and insignificant enjoyment by following their desires in the world and on the Day of Judgment they will receive a painful punishment.
"We have already told you what We have forbidden the Jews. We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.",117,16,وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ حَرَّمْنَا مَا قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَا ظَلَمْنَٰهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"I had made unlawful for the Jews in particular what I had told you about (in verse146 of Sūrah Al-An’am). I did not wrong them by making that unlawful, but they wronged themselves when they committed the causes for retribution. I thus recompensed them for their transgression and I made that unlawful for them as a punishment."
"To those who do wrong out of ignorance, then repent and correct themselves, your Lord is indeed forgiving and kind.",118,16,ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ عَمِلُوا۟ ٱلسُّوٓءَ بِجَهَٰلَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُوٓا۟ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Then your Lord - O Messenger - towards those who do evil deeds out of ignorance of the consequences, even though they do so deliberately, and then they repent to Allah after having done those evil deeds and they make amends to their actions in which there was corruption, your Lord, after repentance, forgives their sins and is merciful to them."
"Abraham was certainly a model of faith, obedient to God and upright, and not one of idolaters,",119,16,إِنَّ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَانِتًا لِّلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Indeed, Abraham (peace be upon him) possessed all the attributes of goodness and always obeyed His Lord turning away from all other religions to the religion of Submission (Islam). He was never an idolater."
"Grateful to Him for His favours; so He chose him and guided him to the path that is straight,",120,16,شَاكِرًا لِّأَنْعُمِهِ ٱجْتَبَىٰهُ وَهَدَىٰهُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,He was thankful for the favours that Allah had given him. Allah had selected Him to be a prophet and had guided him to the true religion of Islam.
"And gave him what is good in the world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous and the good.",121,16,وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَإِنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"I gave him in this world prophethood, praiseworthy mention and pious children. In the afterlife he will be from the righteous for whom Allah has prepared the highest ranks in paradise."
So We commanded you to follow the way of Abraham the upright who was not of idolaters.,122,16,ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ ٱتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Then we revealed to you - O Messenger - “Follow the creed of Abraham in terms of monotheism, freedom from the idolaters, calling towards Allah and practicing His sacred law, turning away from all other religions to the religion of Islam. He was never an idolater as the idolaters claim but he was a man of pure monotheism.”"
"As for the Sabbath, it was imposed on those who had differed about it; and your Lord will tell them on the Day of Resurrection what it was they had differed about.",123,16,إِنَّمَا جُعِلَ ٱلسَّبْتُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Reverence of the Sabbath was only made obligatory on the Jews who differed about it, so that they could free themselves on that day from their occupations for the sake of worship. This was after they had strayed from the day of Friday in which they were instructed to free themselves. Your Lord - O Messenger - will judge between these people who differ on the Day of Judgment about what they used to differ in and He will recompense each person with what they deserve."
"Call them to the path of your Lord with wisdom and words of good advice; and reason with them in the best way possible. Your Lord surely knows who strays from His path, and He knows those who are guided the right way.",124,16,ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ وَجَٰدِلْهُم بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"Invite - O Messenger - to the religion of Islam, you and the believers who follow you, in a manner that is appropriate for the condition, understanding and mindset of the person who you are inviting and with admonition that contains encouragement and caution. Argue with them in the manner that is best in terms of speech, thought and politeness, for it is not your duty to guide people. You are only required to convey the message to them. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from the religion of Islam and He knows best those who are rightly guided to it, so do not lose yourself in grief over them."
"If you have to retaliate, do so to the extent you have been injured; but if you forbear it is best for those who bear with fortitude.",125,16,وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُوا۟ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُم بِهِۦ وَلَئِن صَبَرْتُمْ لَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لِّلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"If you want to retaliate against your enemy then retaliate to the same degree that they harmed you and not more. But if you are patient and do not retaliate despite having the ability to do so, then that is better for the patient amongst you than taking revenge by retaliating against them."
"Endure with patience, for your endurance is not without the help of God. Do not grieve for them, and do not be distressed by their plots.",126,16,وَٱصْبِرْ وَمَا صَبْرُكَ إِلَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَلَا تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا تَكُ فِى ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ,"So be patient - O Messenger - over the harm that they afflict on you. You are only granted the ability to be patient by Allah’s granting it to you. Do not grieve over the disbelievers’ turning away from you, and do not let your heart be constrained by the schemes and plots they carry out."
"God is verily with those who are pious and devout, and those who are doers of good.",127,16,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّٱلَّذِينَ هُم مُّحْسِنُونَ,Allah is with those who are mindful of Him by leaving out sin and those who are good by doings acts of obedience and by fulfilling what they have been instructed to do. Allah’s help and support is with them.
"GLORY TO HIM who took His votary to a wide and open land from the Sacred Mosque (at Makkah) to the distant Mosque whose precincts We have blessed, that We may show him some of Our signs. Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing.",0,17,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِۦ لَيْلًا مِّنَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ إِلَى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْأَقْصَا ٱلَّذِى بَٰرَكْنَا حَوْلَهُۥ لِنُرِيَهُۥ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِنَآ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,"Allah, may He be glorified, is exalted from everything not appropriate for him. It is He who took His servant, Mohammad (peace be upon him), on the night journey from the sacred masjid (mosque), in Makkah, to the masjid of Jerusalem, whose surroundings I have blessed with fruit, crops and dwellings of prophets (peace be upon them), For him to see some of our signs which show Allah's power and ability, may He be glorified. He is the One Who hears everything, no sound escapes Him, and the One who sees evrything, nothing is hidden from Him, and the One who sees from whom nothing seen is hidden."
"We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance for the children of Israel that they should not take another protector apart from Me.",1,17,وَءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ أَلَّا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ مِن دُونِى وَكِيلًا,"I gave Moses (peace be upon him) the Torah and I made it a guide and manual for the Israelites. I said to the Israelites: Do not take besides me any guardian to whom you entrust your affairs. Rather, place your reliance in Me alone."
"O you, the offspring of those We bore (in the ark) with Noah, he was indeed a grateful votary.",2,17,ذُرِّيَّةَ مَنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ عَبْدًا شَكُورًا,"You are from the progeny of those I had favoured with salvation together with Noah (peace be upon him) from drowning in the flood. So remember this favour and thank Allah by worshipping and following Him alone. In this, follow the example of Noah for he was very thankful of Allah."
"We announced to the children of Israel in the Book: ""You will surely create disorder twice in the land, and become exceedingly arrogant.""",3,17,وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا,"I told the Israelites and I informed them in the Torah that definitely they will be guilty of corruption on earth by their sin and arrogance twice, and they will rise over people with injustice and oppression, transgressing the limits in their rise."
"So, when the time of the first prediction came, We sent against you Our creatures full of martial might, who ransacked your cities; and the prediction was fulfilled.",4,17,فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولَىٰهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَآ أُو۟لِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُوا۟ خِلَٰلَ ٱلدِّيَارِ وَكَانَ وَعْدًا مَّفْعُولًا,"When the first corruption occurred, I set against them servants of Ours, possessing great might and power, who killed and displaced them. They ransacked their homes destroying everything they passed by. Allah’s promise of that definitely occurred."
"Then We gave you a chance against them, and strengthened you with wealth and children, and increased your numbers (and said):",5,17,ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَٰكُم بِأَمْوَٰلٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيرًا,"Then once again I gave you - O Israelites - the upper hand and dominance over those who were set against you when you repented to Allah, and I supplied you with wealth after your wealth had been looted, and children after your children were taken captive, and I made you a force more in number than your enemies."
"""If you do good, you will do so for your own good; if you do ill, you will do it for your own loss."" So, when the time of the second prediction comes, (We shall rouse another people) to shame you, and enter the Temple as they had done the first time, and to destroy what they conquered utterly.",6,17,إِنْ أَحْسَنتُمْ أَحْسَنتُمْ لِأَنفُسِكُمْ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَا فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لِيَسُۥٓـُٔوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُوا۟ مَا عَلَوْا۟ تَتْبِيرًا,"If you do good actions - O Israelites - in the manner that is required of you, then the recompense of that will be to your benefit, for Allah is in no need of your actions. If you do bad actions the consequences of that will be to your detriment. Your good actions do not benefit Allah and nor do your bad actions harm Him. When the second corruption occurs I will set your enemies against you to humiliate you and make shame appear on your faces due to the various types of disgrace they will make you taste, and to enter Jerusalem and destroy it just as they entered and destroyed it the first time, and to completely ruin all the lands that they conquer."
"Your Lord may haply be merciful to you. But if you repeat it, We shall do the same. We have constituted Hell as prison for unbelievers.",7,17,عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ حَصِيرًا,"Perhaps your Lord - O Israelites - will have mercy on you after this severe reprisal if you repent to Him and do good actions. But if you revert to causing corruption a third time or more than that, I will revert to taking reprisals from you. I have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers, from which they will not find any release."
"Verily this Qur'an directs you to the path that is straight, and gives happy tidings to those who believe and do the right: For them is a great reward.",8,17,إِنَّ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ يَهْدِى لِلَّتِى هِىَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا كَبِيرًا,"This Qur’ān that is revealed to Muhammad (peace be on him) guides to the best way, which is the way of Islam, and it informs those who have faith in Allah and who do good deeds of something that will please them, which is that they will receive a great reward from Allah."
"As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared a painful punishment.",9,17,وَأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"It informs those who do not have faith in the Day of Judgment of something that will distress them, which is that I have prepared for them a painful punishment on the Day of Judgement."
"Man prays for evil as he prays for good, for man is hasty.",10,17,وَيَدْعُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ بِٱلشَّرِّ دُعَآءَهُۥ بِٱلْخَيْرِ وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ عَجُولًا,"Man on account of his ignorance prays for evil against himself, his children and his wealth when he is angry, just as he prays for good for himself. If we had to answer his prayer for evil he will be ruined and so will his children and his wealth. Human beings are naturally hasty and therefore may hastily bring on something that is harmful."
"We have created night and day as two signs, then We efface the sign of the night, and make the sign of the day resplendent that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and know the computation of years and numbers. We have expounded most distinctly everything.",11,17,وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ ءَايَتَيْنِ فَمَحَوْنَآ ءَايَةَ ٱلَّيْلِ وَجَعَلْنَآ ءَايَةَ ٱلنَّهَارِ مُبْصِرَةً لِّتَبْتَغُوا۟ فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلِتَعْلَمُوا۟ عَدَدَ ٱلسِّنِينَ وَٱلْحِسَابَ وَكُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَصَّلْنَٰهُ تَفْصِيلًا,"I have created the night and the day as two signs indicating Allah’s oneness and power, due to their differences in terms of being long or short, hot or cold. I made the night dark for the purpose of rest and sleep and I made the day bright in which people can see and work for their livelihood. This was so that by the alternation of day and night you can know the number of years and calculate the months, days and hours that you require. I have explained everything in detail so that it may all become clear and the truthful can become distinguished from the liars."
"Round each man's neck We have hung his ledger of deeds, and on the Day of Resurrection will present it as a book spread out (and say):",12,17,وَكُلَّ إِنسَٰنٍ أَلْزَمْنَٰهُ طَٰٓئِرَهُۥ فِى عُنُقِهِۦ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ كِتَٰبًا يَلْقَىٰهُ مَنشُورًا,"For every person I have made the actions that proceed from him attached to him, like how a necklace is attached to the neck. They will not leave him until he is taken to account for them. On the Day of Judgement, I will bring out for him a book that contains every good or bad deed that he did, which he will find spread open before him."
"""Read your ledger; this day you are sufficient to take your own account.",13,17,ٱقْرَأْ كِتَٰبَكَ كَفَىٰ بِنَفْسِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا,I will say to him on that day: O Man! Read your book and take an account of your soul for your deeds. You are enough to take an account of yourself on the Day of Judgement.
"""He who finds the right path does so for himself; and he who goes astray does so to his own loss; and no one who carries a burden bears another's load. We never punish till We have sent a messenger.",14,17,مَّنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِى لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا,"Whoever is guided to faith, then the reward of his being guided is for his own good; and whoever goes astray, the punishment for his going astray is to his detriment. No soul carries the sin of another soul, nor do I ever punish a people until I establish proof against them by sending Messengers to them."
"""And when We destroy a human habitation We send Our command to (warn) its people living a life of ease; and when they disobey, the sentence against them is justified, and We destroy them utterly.",15,17,وَإِذَآ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا۟ فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا ٱلْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَٰهَا تَدْمِيرًا,"When I decided to destroy a town because of its wrongdoing, I instructed those who became reckless because of affluence, to obey Allah but they did not comply. And instead they disobeyed Him and transgressed, so the word of the decimating punishment became justified against them and I destroyed them completely."
"""How many generations have We laid low after Noah, for your Lord knows and notices well enough the sins of His creatures.",16,17,وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ نُوحٍ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرًۢا بَصِيرًا,"And we have destroyed many generations after Noah, such as the Ad and Thamud. Your Lord - O Messenger - is sufficient as a Knower and Seer of the sins of His servants. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will recompense them for the same."
"""Whosoever desires what hastes away, We hasten to give him (in this life) as much as We please to whosoever We will; but afterwards there is Hell for him in which he will burn, disgraced and ostracised.",17,17,مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُۥ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُۥ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَىٰهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا,"Whoever desires, by his acts of goodness, the life of the world and does not have faith in the afterlife nor pays any attention to it, I expedite for him the luxury that I want to give him, not what he wants. Then I have made for him Hell, where he will enter on the Day of Judgment to suffer from its heat, being condemned for his choosing the world and his denial of the Hearafter; banished from Allah’s mercy."
"""But he who desires the Hereafter, and strives for it with a will, and is a believer, will be favoured for his endeavour.",18,17,وَمَنْ أَرَادَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ وَسَعَىٰ لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا,"But whoever desires, by his acts of goodness, the reward of the Hereafter, and pursues it as it should be pursued, free of show and reputation, while he has faith in that which Allah has made faith obligatory; these people who have these attributes - their effort will be accepted by Allah and He will recompense them for it."
"""We bestow from the gifts of your Lord on these and on those, for the gifts of your Lord are not restricted.",19,17,كُلًّا نُّمِدُّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَهَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُورًا,"To both these groups - the sinners and the dutiful - we freely extend the gift of your Lord - O Messenger. The gift of your Lord in the world is not withheld from anyone, whether sinner or dutiful."
"""See, how We favour one over the other; and in life to come are higher ranks and favours greater still.",20,17,ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَلَلْءَاخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَٰتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلًا,"O Messenger, reflect about how we favoured some over others in the world in respect of provision and rank. Yet the Hereafter is greater in the disparity between the ranks of luxury than that of the world, and greater in favours, so a believer should be eager for that."
"""Do not set up another god with God, or you will remain disgraced and destitute.",21,17,لَّا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ فَتَقْعُدَ مَذْمُومًا مَّخْذُولًا,"O servant! Do not set up another deity that you worship together with Allah, or you will become condemned in the sight of Allah and His righteous servants, and forsaken by Him."
"""So your Lord has decreed: Do not worship anyone but Him, and be good to your parents. If one or both of them grow old in your presence, do not say fie to them, nor reprove them, but say gentle words to them",22,17,وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِيَّاهُ وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَٰنًا إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ ٱلْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَآ أَوْ كِلَاهُمَا فَلَا تَقُل لَّهُمَآ أُفٍّ وَلَا تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلًا كَرِيمًا,"Your Lord - O servant - has instructed and made obligatory that you worship none but Him, and He has instructed that you be good to your parents, especially when they become old. If either of them or both of them reach old age with you, do not become annoyed with them by uttering words that indicate the same, do not scold them and do not be harsh when speaking to them, but say to them kind words that are soft and courteous."
"""And look after them with kindness and love, and say: ""O Lord, have mercy on them as they nourished me when I was small.""",23,17,وَٱخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ ٱلذُّلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّحْمَةِ وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱرْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِى صَغِيرًا,"Humble yourself before them in humility and out of compassion, and say: O My Lord, be merciful to them as they have brought me up in my childhood."
"Your Lord knows what is in your heart. If you are righteous, then He is indeed forgiving to those who turn (to Him) in repentance.",24,17,رَّبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِى نُفُوسِكُمْ إِن تَكُونُوا۟ صَٰلِحِينَ فَإِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لِلْأَوَّٰبِينَ غَفُورًا,"Your Lord - O People - knows best what is within you of the sincere devotion to Him in worship, acts of goodness and being dutiful to parents. If the intention in your acts of worship, treatment of your parents and other acts is righteous, then He, may He be glorified, is Forgiving towards those who frequently turn to Him in repentance. If anyone repents from his prior failure to be dutiful to his Lord or to his parents, Allah will forgive him."
"So give to your relatives what is their due, and to those who are needy, and the wayfarers; and do not dissipate (your wealth) extravagantly.",25,17,وَءَاتِ ذَا ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُۥ وَٱلْمِسْكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَلَا تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيرًا,"O believer - give the relative his rights by keeping family ties, give to the poor and needy, and give the traveller who is stranded. Do not spend your wealth in sin or in a manner that is wasteful."
"Those who dissipate (their wealth) are the brethren of the devils, and the Devil was ungrateful to his Lord.",26,17,إِنَّ ٱلْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَٰنَ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينِ وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ لِرَبِّهِۦ كَفُورًا,"Those who spend their wealth in sin and those who are wasteful in their spending are the brothers of the devils, they follow their instructions of being wasteful and extravagant Satan is ever ungrateful towards His Lord, and he only does things that are sinful and only instructs that which displeases His Lord."
"If you neglect (your parents) while seeking the bounty of your Lord, of which you are hopeful, speak to them softly.",27,17,وَإِمَّا تُعْرِضَنَّ عَنْهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ رَحْمَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ تَرْجُوهَا فَقُل لَّهُمْ قَوْلًا مَّيْسُورًا,"But if you refrain from giving these people, due to not having anything to give them, while waiting for Allah to bless you with provision, then say to them gentle and polite words such as praying for them to have abundant provision or promising to give them if Allah grants you wealth."
"Do not be niggardly, nor extravagant that you may later feel reprehensive and constrained.",28,17,وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَىٰ عُنُقِكَ وَلَا تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ ٱلْبَسْطِ فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُومًا مَّحْسُورًا,"Do not withhold your hand from spending, and do not be wasteful when spending, if you do, you will be blameful amongst the people for your miserliness, or you will become uable to spend due to your extravagant expenditure."
"Certainly your Lord provides with open hands whosoever He will, but according to capacity, for He knows and watches His creatures.",29,17,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرًۢا بَصِيرًا,"Your Lord expands the provision for whoever He wills, and restricts it for whoever He wills based on far-reaching wisdom. He is fully aware and observant of His servants. Nothing of theirs is hidden from Him, and He disposes of His matter with respect to them however He wills."
Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you. Killing them is certainly a great wrong.,30,17,وَلَا تَقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَوْلَٰدَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلَٰقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ إِنَّ قَتْلَهُمْ كَانَ خِطْـًٔا كَبِيرًا,"Do not kill your children for fear of poverty in the future if you spend on them. I take charge of providing for them, and for you too. Killing them is a major sin, as they have done nothing wrong and there is no reason requiring them to be killed."
"And do not go near fornication, as it is immoral and an evil way.",31,17,وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلزِّنَىٰٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَٰحِشَةً وَسَآءَ سَبِيلًا,Be careful of fornication and avoid things that prompt it. It is extremely detestable and bad path to traverse as it leads to the mixing of lineages and punishment from Allah.
"And do not take a life, which God has forbidden, except in a just cause. We have given the right (of redress) to the heir of the person who is killed, but he should not exceed the limits (of justice) by slaying (the killer), for he will be judged (by the same law).",32,17,وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا۟ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِى حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَمَن قُتِلَ مَظْلُومًا فَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا لِوَلِيِّهِۦ سُلْطَٰنًا فَلَا يُسْرِف فِّى ٱلْقَتْلِ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ مَنصُورًا,"Do not kill the soul whose life Allah has protected through faith or a pledge of security, except if the killing is merited on the basis of treason or legal retribution. If someone is killed unjustly, without a valid reason permitting his being killed, I have given his successor who takes charge of his affairs certain authority over the killer. He may demand that the killer be killed in retribution, or he may forgive him without asking for any thing in return, or he may forgive him and take the blood money. But he shall not mutilate the killer, or by killing him with something that he did not use to kill, or by killing someone other than the killer, even if he was a helper and supporter."
"And do not touch the property of the orphans except for bettering it, until they come of age; and fulfil the promise made: You will surely be questioned about the promise.",33,17,وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُۥ وَأَوْفُوا۟ بِٱلْعَهْدِ إِنَّ ٱلْعَهْدَ كَانَ مَسْـُٔولًا,"Do not transact in the property of a child whose father has passed away, except in his best interests such as investing or preserving it until he reaches the age of mental and prudential maturity. Fulfill any pledge between yourselves and Allah, or between yourselves and His servants, without breaking or falling short in them. Allah will question the one who made a pledge on the Day of Judgement.   Did he fulfill it, in which case He will reward him, or did he not fulfil it, in which case He will punish him."
"Give full measure when you are measuring, and weigh on a balanced scale. This is better, and excellent its consequence.",34,17,وَأَوْفُوا۟ ٱلْكَيْلَ إِذَا كِلْتُمْ وَزِنُوا۟ بِٱلْقِسْطَاسِ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمِ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا,"Give full measure when you measure for others and do not cheat them. Weigh with an accurate scale that does not diminish or undervalue anything. That giving of full weight and measure is better for you in this world and the Hearafter, than giving short measure or weight."
"Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge. Verily the ear, the eye, the heart, each will be questioned.",35,17,وَلَا تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ إِنَّ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْبَصَرَ وَٱلْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْـُٔولًا,"Do not follow - O son of Adam - that which you have no knowledge of, by following suspicions and conjecture. A person will be questioned about the good or bad that he used his hearing, sight and heart for and he will rewarded for the good and punished for the bad."
"And do not strut about the land with insolence: Surely you cannot cleave the earth, nor attain the height of mountains in stature.",36,17,وَلَا تَمْشِ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَلَن تَبْلُغَ ٱلْجِبَالَ طُولًا,"Do not walk on earth with pride and arrogance. If you walk haughtily on earth you will not be able to split the earth, nor will your stature reach the mountains in height and elevation. Why then are you so proud?!"
All these are evil and odious to your Lord.,37,17,كُلُّ ذَٰلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهًا,The evil of all that has been mentioned above is prohibited by your Lord - O man! Allah is not pleased with those who perpetrate this and He in fact detests them.
"This is some of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you. So do not take another god apart from God, or you will be cast into Hell, reproved, ostracised.",38,17,ذَٰلِكَ مِمَّآ أَوْحَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ ٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا مَّدْحُورًا,"Those instructions, prohibitions and laws that we have explained to you are part of what your Lord has revealed to you. Do not take - O man - another deity together with Allah, for you will be thrown into Hell on the Day of Judgement, blamed by your own soul and by people and banished from every good."
"Has God chosen to give you sons, and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels? You utter grievous things indeed!",39,17,أَفَأَصْفَىٰكُمْ رَبُّكُم بِٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱتَّخَذَ مِنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنَٰثًا إِنَّكُمْ لَتَقُولُونَ قَوْلًا عَظِيمًا,"O you who claim that the angels are Allah’s daughters! Has your Lord chosen you - O idolaters - to have male children, while taking for Himself daughters from among the angels? Allah is above what you are saying. You are indeed saying a terrible thing about Allah by ascribing children to him and claiming that He has daughters persisting in you disbelief."
"We have explained (the truth) in various ways in this Qur'an, that they may be warned; but it only increased their refractoriness.",40,17,وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِى هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ لِيَذَّكَّرُوا۟ وَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا,"I have explained in this Qur’ān laws, admonitions and examples so that people may take heed and tread the path that benefits them leaving that which harms them. But the situation is that the nature of some of them has degenerated to the extent that this only makes them further from the truth and they detest it even more."
"Say: ""Had there been other gods with Him, as they assert, they would surely have sought a way (of opposition) against the Lord of the Throne.""",41,17,قُل لَّوْ كَانَ مَعَهُۥٓ ءَالِهَةٌ كَمَا يَقُولُونَ إِذًا لَّٱبْتَغَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ ذِى ٱلْعَرْشِ سَبِيلًا,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: If there were other deities along with Allah as they say as a fabrication and lie, then those supposed deities would have sought a way to Allah, the Owner of the Throne, to try to defeat and combat with Him over His dominion."
"Too glorious and high is He, too exalted for what they say!",42,17,سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا,"Allah, may He be glorified, is pure and sanctified from what the idolaters attribute to Him and He is far above what they say."
"The seven skies, the earth, and all that lies within them, sing hallelujas to Him. There is nothing that does not chant His praises, but you do not understand their hymns of praise. He is verily clement and forgiving.",43,17,تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ ٱلسَّبْعُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا,"The heavens glorify Allah. The earth glorifies Allah. Every creation in the heavens and the earth also glorifies Allah. There is nothing except that it declares His purity together with His praise, but you do not comprehend their manner of glorifying Him. This is because you only understand the glorification of those who do so in your language. He is Forbearing, not quick to punish, and He is Forgiving to those who repent to Him."
"When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter;",44,17,وَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ جَعَلْنَا بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ حِجَابًا مَّسْتُورًا,"When you - O Messenger - recite the Qur’ān and they hear the warnings and admonitions it contains, I place between you and those who do not have faith in the Day of Judgment a barrier that prevents them from understanding the Qur’ān, as a punishment for their turning away from it."
And We put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears that they should not understand it. So when you invoke your Lord alone in the Qur'an they turn their backs and walk away.,45,17,وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا وَإِذَا ذَكَرْتَ رَبَّكَ فِى ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَحْدَهُۥ وَلَّوْا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَدْبَٰرِهِمْ نُفُورًا,"I have put covers on their hearts so that they cannot understand the Qur’ān, and heaviness in their ears so that they cannot listen to it in a beneficial manner. When you mention your Lord in the Qur’ān alone, and you do not mention their so-called gods, they turn on their heels being far away from accepting Allah’s pure Oneness."
"We know well with what (intent) they hear you, for when they confer privately the wicked say: ""You follow but a man deluded.""",46,17,نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَسْتَمِعُونَ بِهِۦٓ إِذْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِذْ هُمْ نَجْوَىٰٓ إِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا رَجُلًا مَّسْحُورًا,"I know best the way their leaders listen to the Qur’ān. They do not want to take guidance from it, but they want to mock at it and disrupt your recitation. I also know best what they secretly confer about with respect to their denial of and preventing others from it, when these people who wrong themselves by their denial say: You - O People - are only following a man who is bewitched and confused."
"See, what comparisons they coin for you, and go astray, and thus cannot find the way.",47,17,ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُوا۟ لَكَ ٱلْأَمْثَالَ فَضَلُّوا۟ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَبِيلًا,Consider - O Messenger - and be surprised at the various blameworthy attributes they describe you with. They have deviated from the truth and are confused. As a result they cannot find the true path.
"Yet they say: ""When we are turned to bones and bits, shall we be raised as a new creation?""",48,17,وَقَالُوٓا۟ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَٰمًا وَرُفَٰتًا أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقًا جَدِيدًا,"The idolaters said in denial of resurrection: When we die and become bones and our bodies decompose, will we be resurrected again? This is impossible."
"Tell them: ""(Even if) you turn to stones or steel,",49,17,قُلْ كُونُوا۟ حِجَارَةً أَوْ حَدِيدًا,"Say - O Messenger: Become if you can, O idolaters, as hard as stones or as strong as iron, but you will never be able to do this."
"Or some other created thing which may seem to you most difficult (to create)!"" They will then say: ""Who will revert us back?"" Say: ""He who originated you in the first place."" They will shake their heads at you and say: ""When will that be?"" Say: ""In the near future, perhaps,",50,17,أَوْ خَلْقًا مِّمَّا يَكْبُرُ فِى صُدُورِكُمْ فَسَيَقُولُونَ مَن يُعِيدُنَا قُلِ ٱلَّذِى فَطَرَكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَسَيُنْغِضُونَ إِلَيْكَ رُءُوسَهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هُوَ قُلْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيبًا,"Or become some other creation greater than them amongst that which is considered great in your hearts. Allah shall restore you just as He initiated you and He shall bring you back to life just as He created you in the first instance. These opponents will say: Who will bring us back to life after we die? Say to them: He who created you in the first instance without any precedent shall restore you. Then they will shake their heads, mocking your response to them, and say unbelievingly: When will this restoration be? Say to them: Perhaps it is near, as everything which is coming will soon arrive."
"""On the day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praises and imagine you did not tarry but a while.""",51,17,يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Allah will restore you on the day He shall call you towards the plain of resurrection. You will then respond to Him, complying with His command and praising Him, and you will think you had not stayed in the grave, except for a while."
Tell My creatures only to speak words that are good. Verily Satan sows dissensions: Satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind.,52,17,وَقُل لِّعِبَادِى يَقُولُوا۟ ٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ يَنزَغُ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ كَانَ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ عَدُوًّا مُّبِينًا,"Say, O Messenger, to my believing servants: that they should say good words when speaking and refrain from bad off-putting words, because the satan exploits them to spread between them what will spoil their worldly life and their Hearafter. Surely, the satan is an open enemy, so it is necessary to be wary of him."
"Your Lord knows you better: He may have mercy on you if He please, or punish you if He will. Yet We have not sent you as warden over them.",53,17,رَّبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِن يَشَأْ يَرْحَمْكُمْ أَوْ إِن يَشَأْ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلًا,"Your Lord, O people, knows you best. Nothing of yours is hidden from Him. If He wishes to have mercy on you, He will have grace you with having faith and doing good deeds. And if He wishes to punish you, He can punish you by depriving you of faith, leaving you to die on disbelief. And He as not sent the Messenger as a deputy over people, to force them to believe, or stop them from disbelief or to record their deeds. The Messenger is only a conveyor of what Allah has ordered him to convey on His behalf."
Your Lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth. We exalted some of the prophets over the others; and to David We gave the Book of Psalms.,54,17,وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُۥدَ زَبُورًا,"Your Lord, O Messenger, has full knowledge of all who are in the heavens and earth, and He fully knows their conditions and what they deserve. And I preferred some prophets over others through numerous followers and by revealing books to them. And I granted David my book, the Psalms."
"Say: ""Call those whom you imagine to be gods besides Him; yet they have no power to relieve you of any distress or to avert it.""",55,17,قُلِ ٱدْعُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ فَلَا يَمْلِكُونَ كَشْفَ ٱلضُّرِّ عَنكُمْ وَلَا تَحْوِيلًا,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: O idolaters - call upon those you claim to be gods besides Allah when some harm befalls you. They will neither be able to remove the harm from you nor can they transfer it to someone else, due to their inability. Anything incapable cannot be a god"
"Those they invoke themselves seek the way to their Lord, (striving) which one of them shall be nearest (to Him); and hope for His grace, and dread His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is to be feared!",56,17,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُۥ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُۥٓ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ كَانَ مَحْذُورًا,"Those angels and others whom they call upon are themselves seeking good actions to bring them closer to Allah and competing to see who is closest to Him by obeying Him. They hope He has mercy on them and they fear His punishment. The punishment of your Lord, O Messenger, is what should be feared."
"There is not a habitation We shall not destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or not inflict severe punishment upon it. This is in accordance with the law (of God).",57,17,وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا,"And there is no town or city except I will send upon it punishment and destruction in this worldly life due to their disbelief, or afflict it with a mighty punishment such as being killed, due to their disbelief. This destruction and punishment is a divine decree written in the Preserved Tablet."
"Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies. We sent to Thamud the she-camel as a token to make it clear to them, but they treated her cruelly; and We send signs only to deter.",58,17,وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ وَءَاتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ ٱلنَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا۟ بِهَا وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّا تَخْوِيفًا,"And I did not stop sending tangible miracles which the idolaters requested, such as reviving the dead, except because I had sent them to previous nations but they rejected them. I had given Thamud a great, clear sign, namely the camel, but they rejected and so I hastened their punishment. And I do not send miracles at the hands of the Messengers except as a warning for their people, so that they believe."
"When We said to you: ""Verily your Lord circumscribes mankind,"" and showed you the vision and the accursed tree of the Qur'an, it was as a bone of contention for men. Thus do We (instil) fear in them; but they only transgress the more.",59,17,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِٱلنَّاسِ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلرُّءْيَا ٱلَّتِىٓ أَرَيْنَٰكَ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱلشَّجَرَةَ ٱلْمَلْعُونَةَ فِى ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا طُغْيَٰنًا كَبِيرًا,"And remember, O Messenger, when I said to you: Your Lord has encompassed the people in His power and they are in His control. Allah will protect you from them, so convey what you have been ordered to convey. And I did not make what I clearly showed you on the Night Journey except as a test for the people; do they believe it or reject it? And I did not make the tree of Zaqqum, which is mentioned in the Qur’ān as growing from the bottom of the Hellfire, except as a test for them. Thus, if they do not believe in these signs, they will never believe in anything else. And I frighten them by sending signs, but they do not increase through them except in disbelief and remaining further in misguidance."
"When We asked the angels to bow before Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who said: ""Can I bow before him whom You created from clay?""",60,17,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِءَادَمَ فَسَجَدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ قَالَ ءَأَسْجُدُ لِمَنْ خَلَقْتَ طِينًا,"And remember, O Messenger, when I said to the angels: Prostrate to Adam, as a prostration of greeting, not worship, so they complied and all prostrated to him. However, Iblis refused to prostrate to him out of arrogance, saying: Should I prostrate to the one You created out of clay whereas You created me out of fire? I am better than him."
"(And) said: ""Look! This is what you have honoured above me! If You defer (my term) till the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his progeny into complete subjugation, barring a few.""",61,17,قَالَ أَرَءَيْتَكَ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى كَرَّمْتَ عَلَىَّ لَئِنْ أَخَّرْتَنِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لَأَحْتَنِكَنَّ ذُرِّيَّتَهُۥٓ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Iblis said to his Lord: Do you see this creature You have honoured above me by ordering me to prostrate to him? If you keep me alive until the end of this worldly life, I shall allure his children and misguide them from Your straight path, except a few of them You have saved and who are Your chosen servants."
"(And God) said: ""Away! Whosoever of them follows you will surely have Hell with you as requital -- an ample recompense.",62,17,قَالَ ٱذْهَبْ فَمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ فَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ جَزَآؤُكُمْ جَزَآءً مَّوْفُورًا,"His Lord said to him: Go with those amongst them who obey you, because Hell is your recompense and their recompense, a complete and full recompense for your actions."
"Mislead any of them you may with your voice, attack them with your cavalry and soldiers on foot, share their wealth and children with them, and make promises to them."" -- But the promises of Satan are nothing but deceit.",63,17,وَٱسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُم بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلْأَوْلَٰدِ وَعِدْهُمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا,"And mislead those you can mislead through your voice which calls towards disobedience, call out to them through your horsemen and foot soldiers who invite towards obeying you, become a partner to them in their wealth by making attractive every action which opposes the sacred law. And become a partner to them in their children by falsely making a claim to them, attaining them through adultery and making them worship others besides Allah when taking Allah’s name. And make attractive to them false promises and futile aspirations. And the satan only makes false promises which deceive them."
"""You will surely have no power over My devotees: Your Lord is sufficient as their protector.""",64,17,إِنَّ عِبَادِى لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَٰنٌ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا,"You have no control - O Iblis - over My believing servants who act in My obedience, because Allah has repelled your evil from them. And Allah is sufficient as a guardian for one who relies upon Him in his affairs."
It is your Lord who drives your ships across the seas that you may seek of His bounty. He is verily kind to you.,65,17,رَّبُّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى يُزْجِى لَكُمُ ٱلْفُلْكَ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ لِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا,"Your Lord - O people - is the one who makes the ships sail for you in the sea, hoping to seek your sustenance through the profits from trade and the like. He is Merciful to you as He facilitated these means for you."
"When a calamity befalls you on the sea, all those you invoke fail you except Him. But when He brings you safely to the shore, you turn away, for man is most ungrateful.",66,17,وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلضُّرُّ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلَّآ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا نَجَّىٰكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ كَفُورًا,"And when you are afflicted - O idolaters - by some calamity or misfortune at sea such that you fear destruction, those whom you worship besides Allah leave your thoughts, and you only remember Allah and seek His assistance. Then when He assists you and saves you from your fears, and you return to land, you turn away from His Oneness and supplicating Him alone, returning to your idols. And man rejects the blessings of Allah."
"Have you then become so sure that He will not cleave the earth and sink you in it by the shore, or send a gale against you, when you will not find any protector.",67,17,أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلْبَرِّ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِبًا ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُوا۟ لَكُمْ وَكِيلًا,"So do you feel secure - O idolaters - when Allah has delivered you safely to land that He will not make it collapse with you? Or do you feel secure that He will not make stones rain down on you as He did with the people of Lot, then you will not find any protector to protect you nor any helper to save you from being destroyed?"
"Or you feel so secure that He will not send you back (to sea) again or send a gravel-hurtling storm against you, and drown you for your ingratitude? Then you will not find any avenger against Us.",68,17,أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ أَن يُعِيدَكُمْ فِيهِ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفًا مِّنَ ٱلرِّيحِ فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُوا۟ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِۦ تَبِيعًا,"Or do you feel secure that Allah will not return you to sea a second time, then send a strong wind upon you, drowning you due to your being ungrateful for Allah’s blessings after He saved you the first time, then you will not find any claimant against Him for what He did to you and to defend you?"
"Indeed We have honoured the children of Adam, and carried them over land and sea, provided them with good things for their sustenance, and exalted them over many of Our creatures.",69,17,وَلَقَدْ كَرَّمْنَا بَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ وَحَمَلْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَرَزَقْنَٰهُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ وَفَضَّلْنَٰهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلًا,"And I have honoured the children of Adam through intellect, making the angels prostrate to their father, and I subjugated for them the animals and vehicles that carry them on land, and the ships that carry them by sea. And I provided them with good food, drink, spouses and other things, and I granted them much virtue over much of My creation. They must be grateful therefore for Allah’s favours on them."
"The day We shall summon all men with their leaders, whosoever is given his record in his right hand will be able to read his account, and none will be wronged the breadth of a thread.",70,17,يَوْمَ نَدْعُوا۟ كُلَّ أُنَاسٍۭ بِإِمَٰمِهِمْ فَمَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَٰبَهُۥ بِيَمِينِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَقْرَءُونَ كِتَٰبَهُمْ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا,"And remember, O Messenger, when every group will be called out by their leader whom they used to follow in life. So whoever is given his book of deeds in his right hand - they will read their books happily. And nothing will be decreased from their reward, be it as small as the thread on a date seed."
"But whoso has been blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come, even farther astray from the path.",71,17,وَمَن كَانَ فِى هَٰذِهِۦٓ أَعْمَىٰ فَهُوَ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَعْمَىٰ وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا,"And whoever’s heart is blind to accepting and submitting to the truth in this worldly life will be more blind on the Day of Judgment, not finding guidance to the path of paradise, and will be more astray from guidance. And the reward will be equal to the deed."
"They had almost led you away from what has been revealed to you, that you may invent things about Us besides those revealed, when they would have taken you as friend.",72,17,وَإِن كَادُوا۟ لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِىَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُۥ وَإِذًا لَّٱتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلًا,"And the idolaters were about to turn you away, O Messenger, from the Qur’ān I revealed to you, so that you invent something else in my name which conforms to their desires. And if you did what they wanted, they would have chosen you as their beloved friend."
If We had not kept you constant you had almost leaned towards them.,73,17,وَلَوْلَآ أَن ثَبَّتْنَٰكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْـًٔا قَلِيلًا,"And had I not favoured you by making you firm on the truth, you were about to incline towards them slightly and then agree with them in what they requested of you, due to their severe deception and scheming, alongside your extreme eagerness for them to bring faith. However, I protected you from inclining towards them."
"In that case We would have made you taste a double anguish of life and a double anguish of death, and then you would not have been able to find a helper against Us for yourself.",74,17,إِذًا لَّأَذَقْنَٰكَ ضِعْفَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ وَضِعْفَ ٱلْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيرًا,"And had you inclined towards them in what they requested you, I would have given you multiplied punishment in this life and the Hereafter, then you would not find any helper to assist you against Me and avert punishment from you."
"They had nearly expelled you from the land and driven you away from it. But then, they too would have stayed but a little after you.",75,17,وَإِن كَادُوا۟ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لَّا يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَٰفَكَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"And the disbelievers were close to troubling you, due to their enmity towards you, to exile you from Makkah. However, Allah stopped them from exiling you until you yourself migrated on the command of your Lord. And had they exiled you, they would not have remained after exiling you except for a short while."
This has been Our way with the apostles whom We sent before you. You will not find any variation in Our line of action.,76,17,سُنَّةَ مَن قَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَا وَلَا تَجِدُ لِسُنَّتِنَا تَحْوِيلًا,"The issue of their not remaining after you except for a short while is the constant practice of Allah with respect to the Messengers before you, namely that whenever a Messenger was exiled by his people, Allah sent punishment upon them. And you will not find, O Messenger, any change in my practice, but rather you will find it to be established and constant."
"Observe the service of prayer from the sun's declining from the meridian to the darkening of the night, and the recitation at dawn. Indeed the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident.",77,17,أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ لِدُلُوكِ ٱلشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَقُرْءَانَ ٱلْفَجْرِ إِنَّ قُرْءَانَ ٱلْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا,"Establish the prayer by performing it in the most complete manner in its times, which are the declining of the sun from the middle of the sky - and this includes the zuhr and ‘asr prayers - until the darkness of night - and this includes the maghrib and ‘isha prayers. And establish the fajr prayer and lengthen the recitation therein, as the fajr prayer is attended by the angels of night and the angels of day."
Say a supererogatory prayer at the hour of the first watch: Your Lord may raise you to a most exalted station.,78,17,وَمِنَ ٱلَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِۦ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَامًا مَّحْمُودًا,"And in part of the night, O Messenger, stand and pray, so that your prayer increases your rank, and seeking for your Lord to raise you to the praised station on the Day of Judgment, as an intercessor for the people from the horrors of the Day of Judgment, and so that you attain the position of the great intercession, for which the first and last will praise you."
"And pray: ""O my Lord, let my entry be with honour, and let my exit be with honour, and grant me power from You which would help (sustain) me.""",79,17,وَقُل رَّبِّ أَدْخِلْنِى مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ وَأَخْرِجْنِى مُخْرَجَ صِدْقٍ وَٱجْعَل لِّى مِن لَّدُنكَ سُلْطَٰنًا نَّصِيرًا,"And say, O Messenger: O my Lord, make all my entrances and exits in Your obedience and for Your pleasure. And give me from Yourself a clear proof through which You help me against my enemy."
"And say: ""Truth has come and falsehood nullified."" Verily falsehood is perishable.",80,17,وَقُلْ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ ٱلْبَٰطِلُ إِنَّ ٱلْبَٰطِلَ كَانَ زَهُوقًا,"And say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: Islam has come, the help which Allah promised has come true, and idolatry and disbelief has gone. Surely, falsehood is going and will disappear, unable to remain in the face of truth."
"What We have sent down of the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for the faithful, and adds only loss for the sinners.",81,17,وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ إِلَّا خَسَارًا,"And I reveal in the Qur’ān that which cures the hearts of ignorance, disbelief and doubt, cures the bodies when treated through it, and that which is a mercy for the believers who practice it. And this Qur’ān only increases the disbelievers in destruction, as listening to it angers them and makes them deny and turn away from it even more."
When We are gracious to man he turns away and moves aside; yet when evil befalls him he begins to despair.,82,17,وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى ٱلْإِنسَٰنِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَـَٔا بِجَانِبِهِۦ وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ كَانَ يَـُٔوسًا,"And when I grant man a blessing such as health and wealth, he turns away from thanking Allah and obeying Him, and moves further away out of pride. But when illness, poverty or the like befalls him, he becomes extremely despondent and hopeless of Allah’s mercy."
"Say: ""Each one acts according to his disposition, but your Lord knows well who follow the right path.""",83,17,قُلْ كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَىٰ شَاكِلَتِهِۦ فَرَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ سَبِيلًا,"Say, O Messenger: Every man acts on the path which resembles his condition in either guidance or misguidance. But your Lord knows best who is most guided towards the truth."
"They ask you about revelation. Say, revelation is by the command of your Lord, and that you have been given but little knowledge.",84,17,وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلرُّوحِ قُلِ ٱلرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّى وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"O Messenger, the disbelievers among the People of the Book ask you regarding the reality of the soul. Say to them: The soul is from the command of my Lord. And the knowledge you and all the creation of Allah have been granted is little in comparison to the knowledge of Allah."
"If We pleased We could take away what We have revealed to you. Then you will not find any one to plead for it with Us,",85,17,وَلَئِن شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ بِهِۦ عَلَيْنَا وَكِيلًا,"By Allah, if I wanted to take away, O Messenger, the revelation I sent to you by erasing it from the hearts and books, I could take it away, then you would not find anyone to help you and take responsibility to return it."
Unless your Lord have mercy. His blessings on you are great indeed.,86,17,إِلَّا رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ إِنَّ فَضْلَهُۥ كَانَ عَلَيْكَ كَبِيرًا,"However, I did not take it away, by way of mercy from your Lord, and I left it preserved. Surely, your Lord’s grace on you is great, as He made you a Messenger, sealed the prophets upon you, and revealed the Qur’ān to you."
"Say: ""Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.",87,17,قُل لَّئِنِ ٱجْتَمَعَتِ ٱلْإِنسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يَأْتُوا۟ بِمِثْلِ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ لَا يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِۦ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا,"Say, O Messenger: If all of humankind and jinns united to bring the like of this Qur’ān which was revealed to you, in its eloquence, excellent sequence and pure style, they will never be able to bring anything like it, even if they were to all assist and help one another."
"We have given examples of every kind to men in this Qur'an in various ways, and even then most men disdain everything but unbelief,",88,17,وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِى هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ فَأَبَىٰٓ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ إِلَّا كُفُورًا,"And I have explained to people in this Qur’ān and brought all types of advice, reminders, commands, prohibitions and stories they can take lessons from, in the hope they will believe. But most people have refused except to deny this Qur’ān."
"And say: ""We will not believe you until you make a spring of water gush forth from the earth for us;",89,17,وَقَالُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ يَنۢبُوعًا,The idolaters said: I will never believe you until you extract for us from the ground of Makkah a spring that does not stop flowing.
"Or, until you acquire an orchard of date-palm trees and grapes, and produce rivers flowing through it;",90,17,أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرَ خِلَٰلَهَا تَفْجِيرًا,Or you have a garden with many flowers in which you make rivers flow profusely.
"Or, let chunks of sky fall over us, as you assert (you will); or, bring God and the angels as a surety;",91,17,أَوْ تُسْقِطَ ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ قَبِيلًا,"Or you make the sky fall upon us, as you mentioned, as fragments of punishment, or you bring Allah and the angels visibly before us, so they can testify to the truth of what you claim."
"Or, you come to possess a house of gold; or ascend to the skies, though we shall not believe in your having ascended till you bring down a book for us which we could read."" Say: ""Glory to my Lord. I am only man and a messenger.""",92,17,أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِّن زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَىٰ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلَن نُّؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّىٰ تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَٰبًا نَّقْرَؤُهُۥ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّى هَلْ كُنتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَّسُولًا,"Or you have a house adorned with gold and other things, or you ascend to the sky. And if you do ascend to it, we will never believe you have been sent unless you come down with a book written from Allah in which we can read that you are Allah’s Messenger. Say - O Messenger: My Lord is pure, I am only a human Messenger like all other Messengers. I do not have the ability to bring anything, so how can I bring what you have requested?"
"Nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them, other than (what) they said: ""Has God sent (only) a man as messenger?""",93,17,وَمَا مَنَعَ ٱلنَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوٓا۟ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰٓ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوٓا۟ أَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ بَشَرًا رَّسُولًا,"And the only thing which stopped the disbelievers from bringing faith upon Allah and His Messengers, and acting upon what the Messenger brought, was their refusal to accept that a Messenger can be from humankind, as they said denyingly: Did Allah send a Messenger from humankind?"
"Say: ""If angels had peopled the earth and walked about in peace and quiet, We would surely have sent to them an angel as messenger.",94,17,قُل لَّوْ كَانَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَلَٰٓئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولًا,"Say, O Messenger, in response to them: Had there been angels on earth who reside therein and walk about securely, as is your condition, we would have sent an angel Messenger to them from their own kind, because it is he who can make them understand what he has been sent with. It would not be wise to send to them a Messenger from humankind, and likewise is the case with you."
"Tell them: ""God is sufficient witness between me and you, for He knows His creatures well, and is well-informed.""",95,17,قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًۢا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرًۢا بَصِيرًا,"Say, O Messenger: Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you that I am a Messenger was sent to you and that I have conveyed what I was sent to you. Surely, He encompasses the conditions of His servants, nothing of them being hidden from Him, and He sees all the secrets of their souls."
"He is guided whom God guides. As for him He allows to go astray, you will not find a protector other than Him. We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image, blind and dumb and deaf: Their habitation will be Hell. Every time (its fire) subsides We will intensify its flame.",96,17,وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِهِۦ وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَٰهُمْ سَعِيرًا,"And whoever Allah gives the ability for guidance is truly guided. And whoever He removes from it and leads astray, you will never find for them, O Messenger, protectors to guide them to the truth, repel harm from them and bring them benefit. And I will gather them on the Day of Judgment, being dragged on their faces, not seeing, speaking or hearing. Their abode towards which they will go is Hell. Whenever the flames begin to subside, I will make them burn even more."
"This will be their retribution for having denied Our signs and said: ""Once we are turned to bones and bits, can we be raised as a new creation?""",97,17,ذَٰلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَقَالُوٓا۟ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَٰمًا وَرُفَٰتًا أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقًا جَدِيدًا,"That punishment which they will meet is their recompense due to their denial of my signs which I sent to my Messengers, and because they said, considering resurrection to be improbable: When we die and turn in to decomposed bones and scattered particles, will we be resurrected after this as a new creation?"
"Do they not perceive that God, who created the heavens and the earth, has the power to create the like of them? There is no doubt that. He has fixed a term for them. Even then the wicked disdain everything but unbelief.",98,17,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَهُمْ أَجَلًا لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَأَبَى ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ إِلَّا كُفُورًا,"Do these deniers of the resurrection not know that Allah, who created the heavens and who created the earth despite their greatness, has power to create the likes of them? So whoever has the power to create something great has the power to create something smaller. And Allah has made a limited time for them in this world in which their lives will come to an end, and He has made a time for their resurrection in which there is no doubt. But despite the proofs for resurrection being clear, the idolaters refuse except to reject the resurrection."
"Say: ""Even if you owned the stores of the mercy of my Lord, you would have held them back for fear of spending them, for man is niggardly.""",99,17,قُل لَّوْ أَنتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَآئِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّىٓ إِذًا لَّأَمْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ ٱلْإِنفَاقِ وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ قَتُورًا,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: If you possessed my Lord’s treasures which never deplete or finish, you would desist from spending them, fearing they will deplete until you will turn poor. And it is human nature to be miserly, except if one is a believer who spends hoping for Allah’s reward."
"We gave Moses nine clear signs; so ask the children of Israel. When (Moses) came to them the Pharaoh said: ""I think, O Moses, you have been deluded.""",100,17,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ تِسْعَ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ فَسْـَٔلْ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ فَقَالَ لَهُۥ فِرْعَوْنُ إِنِّى لَأَظُنُّكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ مَسْحُورًا,"I granted Moses nine clear proofs which bore testimony for him. They are the staff, the hand, the famine, decrease in fruits, the hurricane, locusts, lice, frogs and blood. O Messenger, ask the Jews when Moses brought these miracles to their predecessors and Pharaoh said: I see you, O Moses, as a man afflicted by magic, as you bring strange things."
"He replied: ""You know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these (signs) as cogent proof. I truly think, O Pharaoh, your days are done.""",101,17,قَالَ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَآ أَنزَلَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِلَّا رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ بَصَآئِرَ وَإِنِّى لَأَظُنُّكَ يَٰفِرْعَوْنُ مَثْبُورًا,"Moses said in response to him: O Pharaoh, you know for sure that these signs have not been sent except by Allah who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. He has sent them as proofs of His power and the truthfulness of His Messenger. But you have rejected. And I know, O Pharaoh, that you are going to be a destroyed loser."
"Then he sought to turn them out of the land, but We drowned him and all his followers.",102,17,فَأَرَادَ أَن يَسْتَفِزَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَغْرَقْنَٰهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُۥ جَمِيعًا,"So Pharaoh intended to punish Moses (peace be upon him) and his people by exiling them from Egypt, so I destroyed him and all the armies with him by drowning them."
"After this We told the children of Israel: ""Dwell in the land. When the promise of reckoning comes, We shall bring you together from a motley crowd.",103,17,وَقُلْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ لِبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱسْكُنُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْضَ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ جِئْنَا بِكُمْ لَفِيفًا,"And I said to the Israelites after destroying Pharaoh and his armies: Settle in the land of the Levant. Then when the Day of Judgment comes, I shall bring you all to the plain of gathering for the accounting."
"We have sent it down with truth, and with truth has (the Qur'an) come down. And We have sent you only to give good news and to warn.",104,17,وَبِٱلْحَقِّ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ وَبِٱلْحَقِّ نَزَلَ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا,"And with truth I revealed the Qur’ān on Muhammad (peace be upon him) and with truth it came down on him, without any change or tampering. And I did not send you, O Messenger, except to give glad tidings of paradise to those mindful of Him and to warn the disbelievers and sinful of Hell."
"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation. That is why We sent it down by degrees.",105,17,وَقُرْءَانًا فَرَقْنَٰهُ لِتَقْرَأَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ مُكْثٍ وَنَزَّلْنَٰهُ تَنزِيلًا,"And I sent it as a Qur’ān which I have separated and explained, in the hope that you read it to people slowly and carefully, as this is more effective for understanding and reflecting. And I revealed it in separate portions according to incidents and conditions."
"Say: ""Believe in it or do not believe: Those who were given knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out to them,",106,17,قُلْ ءَامِنُوا۟ بِهِۦٓ أَوْ لَا تُؤْمِنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِۦٓ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا,"Say, O Messenger: Believe in it, for your belief will not increase it in any way, or do not believe in it, for your disbelief will not decrease it in any way. Surely, those who read the previous divine books and who understood the revelation and prophecy when the Qur’ān is recited to them fall on their faces, prostrating to Allah out of gratitude."
"And say: ""Glory be to our Lord. The promise of our Lord has indeed been fulfilled.""",107,17,وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَٰنَ رَبِّنَآ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولًا,"And they say in their prostration: Our Lord will never break His promise. The promise He made of sending Muhammad (peace be upon him) is going to happen. Surely, our Lord’s promise of this and other matters will definitely occur."
"And weeping they kneel down, and this increases their humility.",108,17,وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا,"And they fall on their faces, prostrating to Allah and crying out of His fear. And listening to the Qur’ān and contemplating its meanings increases them in submission to Allah and fearing Him."
"Say: ""Call Him Allah or call Him Ar-Rahman; whatever the name you call Him by, all His names are beautiful."" Do not say your prayers too loudly or in too low a voice, but follow a middle coarse.",109,17,قُلِ ٱدْعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ أَوِ ٱدْعُوا۟ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُوا۟ فَلَهُ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَلَا تَجْهَرْ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَٱبْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا,"Say, O Messenger, to those who criticise you for supplicating by saying, ‘O Allah, O Merciful’: Allah and the Merciful are names of His, so supplicate Him with any of them or other names of His. For Him are all beautiful names, and these two are amongst them, so supplicate Him through these two or other beautiful names of His. And do not recite loudly in your prayer in case the idolaters hear you and do not recite so quietly that the believers cannot hear you, but rather choose a middle path between the two."
"And say: ""All praise be to God who has neither begotten a son nor has a partner in His kingdom; nor has He need of any one to protect Him from ignominy. So extol Him by extolling His majesty.""",110,17,وَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ شَرِيكٌ فِى ٱلْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلِىٌّ مِّنَ ٱلذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيرًۢا,"Say - O Messenger: All praise is for Allah who deserves all types of praise and who is exalted from having a child or a partner, thus He has no partner in His kingdom. And He is not afflicted by disgrace or weakness, hence He has no need for anyone to help and support Him. So exalt Him abundantly, and do not attribute any child or partner to Him nor any helper or supporter."
"ALL PRAISE BE to God who has revealed to His votary the Book which is free of all obliquity,",0,18,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُۥ عِوَجَا,"Praise of the attributes of perfection and majesty and for the outer and inner favours is for Allah alone, who revealed the Qur’ān to His servant and Messenger, and did not put any crookedness or diversion from the truth in this Qur’ān."
"Immutable, so that it may warn of a severe punishment from Him; and give happy tidings to those who believe and do the right that there is a better reward (of Paradise) for them,",1,18,قَيِّمًا لِّيُنذِرَ بَأْسًا شَدِيدًا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا حَسَنًا,"But rather He made it straight without any contradiction or discrepancy in it, to frighten those who deny the truth of a severe punishment which awaits them from Allah, and to tell the believers who do good actions what will please them, namely that there is a good reward for them which no other reward compares with."
Where they will abide for ever;,2,18,مَّٰكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًا,"Living in this reward forever, without it being cut off from them."
"And that it may warn those who say: ""God has begotten a son.""",3,18,وَيُنذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَدًا,"And it frightens the Jews, Christians and some of the idolaters who said: Allah has taken a son."
"They have no knowledge of this, as their fathers did not have. How terrible are the words they utter! They speak nothing but lies.",4,18,مَّا لَهُم بِهِۦ مِنْ عِلْمٍ وَلَا لِءَابَآئِهِمْ كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَفْوَٰهِهِمْ إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلَّا كَذِبًا,These fabricators have no knowledge of their claim that Allah has a son and nor did their fathers whom they followed in this regard have any knowledge. This statement which has escaped their mouths without any understanding is heinous. They only speak a lie which has no basis or support.
Will you kill yourself for grief of them if they do not believe in this presentation?,5,18,فَلَعَلَّكَ بَٰخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهَٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ أَسَفًا,"Then perhaps, O Messenger, you will end up destroying yourself out of grief and remorse if they do not believe this Qur’ān. But do not do this, as giving them guidance is not your responsibility; you are only responsible for conveying."
We have made whatever exists on the earth its adornment to test and try them (and) know who acts better;,6,18,إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ زِينَةً لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا,"Surely, I have made the creation on the face of this earth an adornment for it, so I can test them to see which of them does the best actions which please Allah and which of them is worst in actions, so that I may reward everyone with what they deserve."
For We shall certainly turn it to barren dust.,7,18,وَإِنَّا لَجَٰعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيدًا جُرُزًا,"And I am going to turn the creation on the face of this earth into dust free from vegetation, and this will be after the lifespan of the creation on earth expires, so let them take heed from this."
Do you think the men of the cave and Ar-Raqim were so strange among Our signs?,8,18,أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْكَهْفِ وَٱلرَّقِيمِ كَانُوا۟ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِنَا عَجَبًا,"Do not think, O Messenger, that the story of the people of the cave and the tablet on which their names were written are from our amazing signs. In fact, other signs such as creating the heavens and earth are more amazing."
"When those young men took shelter in the cave, and prayed: ""O Lord, grant us Your favour and dispose our affair aright,""",9,18,إِذْ أَوَى ٱلْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ فَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا,"Remember, O Messenger, when the believing youngsters took refuge in the cave, fleeing with their religion. Then they said in their supplication to their Lord: Our Lord, give us mercy from Yourself, by forgiving our sins and saving us from our enemies, and grant us guidance towards the right path and correctness in the matter of migrating from the disbelievers and in faith."
"We sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years,",10,18,فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ فِى ٱلْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدًا,"Then after they went and took refuge in the cave, I put a barrier on their ears from hearing, and I put them to sleep for many years."
Then roused them to ascertain which of the two groups could account for the period they had stayed.,11,18,ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَٰهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَىُّ ٱلْحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُوٓا۟ أَمَدًا,Then after their lengthy sleep I woke them up to demonstrate which of the two groups disputing their duration of stay in the cave knows this duration best.
We narrate their story to you in all truth. They were a few young men who believed in their Lord; so We gave them greater guidance.,12,18,نَّحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ نَبَأَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَٰهُمْ هُدًى,"I am informing you, O Messenger, of their affair, truthfully without any doubt. Surely, they were youngsters who believed in their Lord and obeyed Him, and I increased them in guidance and firmness on the truth."
"And strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said: ""Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall invoke no god beside Him, for we shall have uttered a blasphemy then.",13,18,وَرَبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ إِذْ قَامُوا۟ فَقَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَن نَّدْعُوَا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ إِلَٰهًا لَّقَدْ قُلْنَآ إِذًا شَطَطًا,"And I strengthened their hearts with faith and firmness on it, and to be patient in leaving one’s homeland for its sake, when they stood to proclaim their faith in Allah alone in front of the disbelieving king, and they said: The Lord I believe in and worship is the Lord of the heavens and earth. I will never worship the gods you have falsely claimed besides Him. I will have said an unjust and far-off statement if I worship others besides Him."
"As for these our people here, they have taken to other gods apart from Him. Then why do they not bring a clear authority for them? Who is more wicked than he who fabricates a lie against God?""",14,18,هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ قَوْمُنَا ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةً لَّوْلَا يَأْتُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِسُلْطَٰنٍۭ بَيِّنٍ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا,"Then they turned to each other saying: These are our people who have taken deities which they worship besides Allah. They do not have any clear proof for worshipping them, so there is no greater oppressor than one who falsely attributes a partner to Allah."
"(And they said to each other:) ""Now that you have withdrawn from them and what they worship beside God, it is better to take refuge in the cave. Your Lord may bestow of His mercy on you, and facilitate your affair.""",15,18,وَإِذِ ٱعْتَزَلْتُمُوهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ فَأْوُۥٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ يَنشُرْ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُم مِّن رَّحْمَتِهِۦ وَيُهَيِّئْ لَكُم مِّنْ أَمْرِكُم مِّرْفَقًا,"Now that you have moved away from your people, and have left what they worship instead of Allah, and you have worshipped Allah alone, then take refuge in the cave fleeing to protect your religion. Allah, may He be glorified, will shower His mercy on you to protect you from your enemies, and will make for you an easy means of livelihood that you could benefit from in place of the life that you had when living amongst your people."
"You may well have seen when the sun came up it moved away to the right of the cave, and when it went down it turned away to the left, and they stayed in its open space. This was among the signs of God. Whoever is guided by God follows the right path; and whosoever goes astray will not find a guide to show him the way.",16,18,وَتَرَى ٱلشَّمْسَ إِذَا طَلَعَت تَّزَٰوَرُ عَن كَهْفِهِمْ ذَاتَ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَإِذَا غَرَبَت تَّقْرِضُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَهُمْ فِى فَجْوَةٍ مِّنْهُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ مَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُۥ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا,"They thus fulfilled the instruction and Allah put them to sleep and protected them from their enemy. You - O one who looks at them - will see the sun when it rises from the east inclining away from their cave to the right of one entering it; and at the time of sunset it moves away from the cave towards the left but does not strike it directly. They are therefore in perpetual shade unaffected by the heat of the sun. They are in a wide space within the cave where the air they require reaches them. The abovementioned occurrences viz. their taking refuge in the cave, their being put to sleep, the sun’s deviation from them, the spaciousness in the cave and their salvation from their people are all wondrous acts of Allah that indicate His power. Whoever Allah guides to the path of guidance, such a person is rightly guided in reality. Whoever Allah forsakes and lets go astray, then you will never find anyone to help and guide him to the right path. This is because guidance is in Allah’s Hands and not in his."
"You may have thought that they were awake, yet they were asleep. We made them turn right and left, while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold. If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight.",17,18,وَتَحْسَبُهُمْ أَيْقَاظًا وَهُمْ رُقُودٌ وَنُقَلِّبُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَكَلْبُهُم بَٰسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بِٱلْوَصِيدِ لَوِ ٱطَّلَعْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَوَلَّيْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِرَارًا وَلَمُلِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ رُعْبًا,"You - O one who looks at them - will think they are awake, because their eyes are open, though in actual fact they are asleep. I turn them over in their sleep, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, so that the earth does not consume their bodies. Their dog that accompanied them stretches out its forelegs at the entrance of the cave. If you had come across them and seen them, you would have turned and run away being afraid of them, and your soul would have been filled with fear of them."
"Even so We roused them that they may question one another. One of them asked: ""How long have you stayed here?"" They said: ""A day or less than a day."" ""Your Lord knows best,"" they said, ""how long you have stayed. So send one of you to the town with this money of yours to look for wholesome food and bring it for you; but he should be careful not to let your presence known.",18,18,وَكَذَٰلِكَ بَعَثْنَٰهُمْ لِيَتَسَآءَلُوا۟ بَيْنَهُمْ قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ قَالُوا۟ لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثْتُمْ فَٱبْعَثُوٓا۟ أَحَدَكُم بِوَرِقِكُمْ هَٰذِهِۦٓ إِلَى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ فَلْيَنظُرْ أَيُّهَآ أَزْكَىٰ طَعَامًا فَلْيَأْتِكُم بِرِزْقٍ مِّنْهُ وَلْيَتَلَطَّفْ وَلَا يُشْعِرَنَّ بِكُمْ أَحَدًا,"Just as I did to them the wondrous acts that I have mentioned, I awakened them after a long period of time and they began to ask one another about the period that they had spent asleep. One of them responded: I remained asleep for one day or part of one day. One of them, to whom it was not clear how long they had spent asleep, responded: Your Lord knows best about the period you had remained asleep, so entrust the knowledge of that to Him and get busy with what concerns you. Send one of you with these silver coins to the city we know and let him see which of the inhabitants of that city are most pure in their food and earnings. He should proceed with caution when entering and leaving and when dealing. He must also be tactful and not let anyone find out where you are, because that will result in great harm."
"If they come to know of you they will stone you to death, or force you to go back to their creed; then you will never succeed.""",19,18,إِنَّهُمْ إِن يَظْهَرُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ يَرْجُمُوكُمْ أَوْ يُعِيدُوكُمْ فِى مِلَّتِهِمْ وَلَن تُفْلِحُوٓا۟ إِذًا أَبَدًا,"If your people discover you and find out where your whereabouts, they will kill you by stoning you, or they will force you to return to their deviated creed that you used to follow before Allah favoured you by guiding you to the true religion. If you return to that you will never succeed - not in this world nor in the Hearafter. Instead, you will suffer a great loss in both places on account of your leaving the true religion to which Allah had guided you and your returning to that deviated creed."
"Thus did We inform the people about them that they may know the promise of God is true, and there is no doubt that the Hour will come. As they were arguing among themselves as to what should be done with them, (some) said: ""Erect a monument over them. Their Lord is best cognisant of them."" Those who prevailed, said: ""We shall build a place of worship over their (sepulchre).""",20,18,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ لِيَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَآ إِذْ يَتَنَٰزَعُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَمْرَهُمْ فَقَالُوا۟ ٱبْنُوا۟ عَلَيْهِم بُنْيَٰنًا رَّبُّهُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِهِمْ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ غَلَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَمْرِهِمْ لَنَتَّخِذَنَّ عَلَيْهِم مَّسْجِدًا,"Just as I did those wondrous acts, of putting them to sleep and awakening them after many years, indicating My Power, I caused them to be discovered by the people of their city, so that those people would know that the promise of Allah to help the believers and of resurrection is true, and that the rising is coming without doubt. After the matter of the people of the cave was exposed and they had passed away, those who discovered them differed: What should they do with regard to them? One group said: Build over the entrance of the cave a building that will serve as a barrier and will preserve them. Their Lord knows best about their condition and their condition requires that they have some special status in His sight.   The influential people who did not have knowledge or a proper call said: I will set up over them a place of worship in their honour and as a memoir of their location."
"Some will say: ""They were three, and their dog was the fourth;"" and some will also say: ""They were five and their dog was the sixth,"" -- guessing in the dark. And some will even say: ""They were seven, and their dog the eighth."" Say: ""My Lord alone knows best their number; none but only a few know of them."" So do not argue about it with them but lightly, and do not enquire about them from any one of them.",21,18,سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَٰثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًۢا بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ قُل رَّبِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلَّا مِرَآءً ظَٰهِرًا وَلَا تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِم مِّنْهُمْ أَحَدًا,"Some of those who delve into their incident will say about their number: They were three and their dog was the fourth amongst them. Others will say: They were five and their dog was the sixth amongst them. Both groups only said this as a guess without any proof. Some of them will say: They were seven and their dog was the eighth amongst them. Say, O Messenger: Your Lord knows best about their number. No one knows their number except for a few people whom Allah has informed about their number. So do not dispute with regard to their number or any other matter of theirs with the people of the scripture or with others except with an obvious argument and without delving into the matter, limiting it to the revelation that has come down to you with respect to them. Do not ask any of them about the details of their matter, because they do not know about it."
"Do not say of any thing: ""I will do it tomorrow,""",22,18,وَلَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَا۟ىْءٍ إِنِّى فَاعِلٌ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا,"Do not say - O Prophet - about anything that you want to do tomorrow: “I am going to do this tomorrow,” because you do not know whether you will do it or you will be prevented from doing so? This is a directive for every Muslim."
"Without (adding), ""if God may please;"" and think of your Lord in ease you forget, and say: ""Perhaps my Lord will show me a nearer way to rectitude.""",23,18,إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ إِذَا نَسِيتَ وَقُلْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَهْدِيَنِ رَبِّى لِأَقْرَبَ مِنْ هَٰذَا رَشَدًا,Unless you suspend doing so on Allah’s will by saying: I will do it - if Allah wills - tomorrow. Remember your Lord by saying: “If Allah wills” - if you forget to say it - and say: I have hope that my Lord will guide me to something closer than this in guidance and success.
(It is said) they stayed in the cave three hundred years and nine.,24,18,وَلَبِثُوا۟ فِى كَهْفِهِمْ ثَلَٰثَ مِا۟ئَةٍ سِنِينَ وَٱزْدَادُوا۟ تِسْعًا,The people of the cave remained in their cave for three hundred and nine years.
"You say: ""God only knows how long they stayed. He alone knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. How distinctly He sees and hears! They have no other guardian but Him, and He does not share His authority with any one.""",25,18,قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثُوا۟ لَهُۥ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَبْصِرْ بِهِۦ وَأَسْمِعْ مَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا يُشْرِكُ فِى حُكْمِهِۦٓ أَحَدًا,"Say - O Messenger: Allah knows best about how long they remained in the cave and He has told us about the period they remained there. No statement can be considered after Allah’s, may He be glorified. To Him alone, may He be glorified, belongs everything hidden in the heavens and on earth. He created and knows all of it. How well He sees! May He be glorified! He sees everything. How well He hears! He hears everything. They have no one to take charge of their matter besides Him. He does not share His rule with anyone. He alone passes judgement."
Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no one who can change the word of God; and you will not find refuge except in Him.,26,18,وَٱتْلُ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن كِتَابِ رَبِّكَ لَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مُلْتَحَدًا,"Read - O Messenger - and practice the Qur’ān that Allah has revealed to you. Nothing can change His words, because they are completely true and just. You will not find any refuge to resort to or place of protection to take cover in besides Him."
"Persevere with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. Do not turn your eyes away from them, seeking the splendours of this world, and do not follow him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound.",27,18,وَٱصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَوٰةِ وَٱلْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُۥ وَلَا تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُۥ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُۥ فُرُطًا,"Remain and be close with your poor companions who sincerely call on their Lord in worship and supplication at the beginning and at the end of the day. Do not let your eyes overlook them intending to sit with people of affluence and prestige. Do not follow the one whose heart I have made neglectful of Our remembrance by sealing it and who instructed you to remove the poor from your gathering giving preference to following his desire over following His Lord. His actions and deeds are thus foolish, excessive and in vain."
"Say: ""The truth is from your Lord: So believe if you like, or do not believe if you will."" We have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent. If they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouths. How evil the drink, and evil the resting-place!",28,18,وَقُلِ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ نَارًا أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُوا۟ يُغَاثُوا۟ بِمَآءٍ كَٱلْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى ٱلْوُجُوهَ بِئْسَ ٱلشَّرَابُ وَسَآءَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا,"Say - O Messenger: to those who neglect Allah’s remembrance due to the heedlessness of their hearts: What I have brought to you is the truth. It is from Allah and not from me. I cannot accede to your request to chase away the believers. Whoever amongst you wishes to have faith in this truth then let him do so for he will be pleased by the reward. Whoever amongst you wants to reject it let him do so, for he will be grieved by the punishment that awaits him. I have prepared for those who wrong themselves, by choosing disbelief, a huge fire whose walls will surround them and as a result they will not be able to escape from it. If they had to seek relief of water on account of the severe thirst they experience, they will be given water like murky oil that will be extremely hot and will scald their faces due to its heat. What a terrible drink is this drink that will be provided for their relief! It will not quench their thirst but will make it worse and it will not put out the flames burning their faces. What a miserable destination and place of residence is the fire!"
But surely We do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste.,29,18,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلًا,"Those who have faith in Allah and do righteous actions have done Ill and they will receive a huge reward. I do not let the reward of those who do Ill go to waste. Instead, I give them their reward in full without any reduction."
"There will be gardens of Eden for them, with rivers flowing by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold, with silken robes of green and of brocades to wear, reclining on couches. How excellent the guerdon, and excellent the resting-place!",30,18,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَابًا خُضْرًا مِّن سُندُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ مُّتَّكِـِٔينَ فِيهَا عَلَى ٱلْأَرَآئِكِ نِعْمَ ٱلثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا,"Those who are described as having faith and doing righteous actions will receive gardens to reside in, with the sweet rivers of paradise flowing beneath their homes. They will be adorned with bracelets of gold and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline on couches decorated with beautiful coverings. Theirs will be an excellent reward and paradise will be an excellent home and place for them to reside in."
"Tell them the parable of two men. We gave one two gardens of grapes surrounded by date-palm trees, with corn fields in between.",31,18,وَٱضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلًا رَّجُلَيْنِ جَعَلْنَا لِأَحَدِهِمَا جَنَّتَيْنِ مِنْ أَعْنَٰبٍ وَحَفَفْنَٰهُمَا بِنَخْلٍ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمَا زَرْعًا,"Strike - O Messenger - an example of two men: a disbeliever and a believer. I gave the disbeliever two gardens, which I surrounded with date-palms; and in the vacant land I grew crops."
Each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least; and We made a stream flow in between them.,32,18,كِلْتَا ٱلْجَنَّتَيْنِ ءَاتَتْ أُكُلَهَا وَلَمْ تَظْلِم مِّنْهُ شَيْـًٔا وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلَٰلَهُمَا نَهَرًا,"Each garden produced its fruit of dates, grapes and crops and did not fall short thereof in anything, but bore it in full. I caused a river to flow between the two gardens so that they could be irrigated easily."
"So he became rich. Arguing one day with his friend he said: ""I have more wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen.""",33,18,وَكَانَ لَهُۥ ثَمَرٌ فَقَالَ لِصَٰحِبِهِۦ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُۥٓ أَنَا۠ أَكْثَرُ مِنكَ مَالًا وَأَعَزُّ نَفَرًا,"The owner of the two gardens had other wealth and fruit and he said to his friend, as he spoke to him in conceit to make an impact on him, “I have more wealth than you, more support and a stronger family.”"
"And he walked into his garden, and, (forgetting) his limit, said: ""I cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined,",34,18,وَدَخَلَ جَنَّتَهُۥ وَهُوَ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِۦ قَالَ مَآ أَظُنُّ أَن تَبِيدَ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أَبَدًا,"The disbeliever entered his garden along with the believer to show it to him, whilst he was wronging himself by his disbelief and conceit. The disbeliever said: I do not think that this garden that you see will ever perish, because I have taken all measures for its survival."
"Nor can I think that the Hour (of Doom) will come, And even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find a better place there than this.""",35,18,وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَآئِمَةً وَلَئِن رُّدِدتُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّى لَأَجِدَنَّ خَيْرًا مِّنْهَا مُنقَلَبًا,"I also do not think that the rising will occur. Life will simply continue. If it does occur and I happened to be resurrected and be returned to my Lord, then I will find that what I will go back to after resurrection will be better than this garden of mine. My being rich in this world means that I will be rich after resurrection as well."
"Disputing with him, his companion said: ""Do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then formed you into a man?",36,18,قَالَ لَهُۥ صَاحِبُهُۥ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُۥٓ أَكَفَرْتَ بِٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكَ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ سَوَّىٰكَ رَجُلًا,"His believing friend said to him whilst having this conversation: Do you reject the One Who created your father, Adam, from dust. Then He created you from sperm. Then He made you into a male human being and proportioned your limbs making you complete? The One who has power to do all of that is able to resurrect you."
"And He is God, my Lord, and I do not associate any one with my Lord.",37,18,لَّٰكِنَّا۠ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّى وَلَآ أُشْرِكُ بِرَبِّىٓ أَحَدًا,"But I do not profess this statement of yours. I simply say: He, Allah, may He be glorified, is my Lord, who has showered us with His blessings, and I do not associate anyone with Him in worship."
"When you entered your garden, why did you not say: 'As God may please;' for no one has power except given by God? Though you see me poorer in wealth and children than you,",38,18,وَلَوْلَآ إِذْ دَخَلْتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلْتَ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِٱللَّهِ إِن تَرَنِ أَنَا۠ أَقَلَّ مِنكَ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا,"If only, when you entered your garden, you had said: As Allah wills. No one has any power except through Allah. He is the One Who does as He pleases and He is the One of strength- if you regard me as someone poorer than you and one with less children."
"Yet, my Lord may haply give me a garden better than yours, and He may send a thunder-bolt, from the skies and in the morning it will be a barren plain;",39,18,فَعَسَىٰ رَبِّىٓ أَن يُؤْتِيَنِ خَيْرًا مِّن جَنَّتِكَ وَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْهَا حُسْبَانًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتُصْبِحَ صَعِيدًا زَلَقًا,"I anticipate that Allah will give me something better than your garden and that He will send on your garden a punishment from the sky, making it a barren piece of land on which feet will slip due to its being so smooth."
"Or else of a morning its water may sink underground, and you will not find a trace of it.""",40,18,أَوْ يُصْبِحَ مَآؤُهَا غَوْرًا فَلَن تَسْتَطِيعَ لَهُۥ طَلَبًا,"Or its water may sink so deep into the ground that you will never be able to reach it again in any way. Once the water sinks deep, the garden will not survive."
"And his vines were overtaken (with disaster), and he began to wring his hands (at the loss) of what he had spent on them, for the vines had fallen upon their trellises; and he said: ""Would to God that I had not associated any one with my Lord.""",41,18,وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِۦ فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنفَقَ فِيهَا وَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا وَيَقُولُ يَٰلَيْتَنِى لَمْ أُشْرِكْ بِرَبِّىٓ أَحَدًا,"What the believer anticipated occurred. Destruction engulfed the fruit of the disbeliever’s garden and the disbeliever began wringing his hands on account of extreme regret and remorse over the money that he had spent on its maintenance and upkeep, whilst the garden had fallen over the supports on which the grapevines are spread out and he was saying: I wish I had believed in my Lord alone, and I had not associated anyone with Him in worship."
"He had no body to help him other than God, nor was he able to save himself.",42,18,وَلَمْ تَكُن لَّهُۥ فِئَةٌ يَنصُرُونَهُۥ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مُنتَصِرًا,"This disbeliever had no group to protect him from the punishment that fell on him, whereas he was the one who used to boast about his group. He himself too could not stop Allah from destroying his garden."
"The jurisdiction in this province belongs to God. His is the best reward, and His the best requital.",43,18,هُنَالِكَ ٱلْوَلَٰيَةُ لِلَّهِ ٱلْحَقِّ هُوَ خَيْرٌ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ عُقْبًا,"In that situation, victory is for Allah alone. He, may He be glorified, is best in rewarding His friends who have faith, as He multiplies the reward for them, and He is best in outcome for them."
"Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation, which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind. God has power over everything.",44,18,وَٱضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَٱخْتَلَطَ بِهِۦ نَبَاتُ ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ ٱلرِّيَٰحُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا,Strike - O Messenger - an example for those who are deceived by the world. In its temporality and fleeting existence it is similar to rain water that I sent down from the sky. On account of this water the vegetation of the earth grew and ripened. Then this vegetation is broken down into pieces and the wind carries it away to far-lying places and the earth once again becomes as it was previously. Allah has full power over all of that. Nothing is outside His ability. He gives life to whatever He wishes and causes whatever He wishes to perish.
"Wealth and children are only the gloss of this world, but good deeds that abide are better with your Lord for recompense, and better for expectation.",45,18,ٱلْمَالُ وَٱلْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْبَٰقِيَٰتُ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا,"Wealth and children are things of adornment in this worldly life. Wealth will only be of benefit in the afterlife if it is spent on that which pleases Allah. Actions and statements that are pleasing to Allah are better in reward than all the beauty in the world. That is the best thing a person can have hope in, because the beauty of the world will perish while the reward for actions and statements that are pleasing to Allah will last."
"The day We shall move the mountains, and you see the earth an open plain, We shall gather them together, leaving none behind.",46,18,وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ ٱلْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى ٱلْأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَٰهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَدًا,"Remember the day when I will remove the mountains from their places, and you will see the earth as an open plain as all the mountains, trees and buildings on it will be gone. I will gather all created things together and resurrect them, leaving no one."
"They will be arraigned before their Lord row on row, (and He will say): ""Well, you have come to Us as We had first created you, even though you imagined We had fixed no time for this meeting.""",47,18,وَعُرِضُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ صَفًّا لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا كَمَا خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍۭ بَلْ زَعَمْتُمْ أَلَّن نَّجْعَلَ لَكُم مَّوْعِدًا,"People will be presented to your Lord in rows and He will take them to account. It will be said to them: Now you have come to Us individually, barefoot and naked as I created you the first time. Although you claimed that you will never be resurrected and that I will not set for you a time and place in which I will recompense you for your actions."
"The ledger (of their deeds) would be placed before them. Then you will see the sinners terrified at its contents, and say: ""Alas, what a written revelation this, which has not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing!"" They will find in it whatsoever they had done. Your Lord does not wrong any one.",48,18,وَوُضِعَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ فَتَرَى ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ وَيَقُولُونَ يَٰوَيْلَتَنَا مَالِ هَٰذَا ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَا يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلَا كَبِيرَةً إِلَّآ أَحْصَىٰهَا وَوَجَدُوا۟ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ حَاضِرًا وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا,"The book of deeds will be placed. Some people will take the book in their right hands and some will take it in their left hands. You - O man - will see the disbelievers fearful of its contents, because they are aware of the disbelief and sins that they sent forward. They will say: May we be destroyed!   What is with this book that leaves no action of ours, small or big, but it has recorded and enumerated it? They will find all the sins they had done in their worldly life written and recorded. Your Lord - O Messenger - does not wrong anyone. He does not punish anyone for no reason and He does not reduce the reward of those who follows Him."
"When We said to the angels: ""Bow before Adam in adoration,"" they all bowed but Iblis. He was one of the jinni and rebelled against his Lord's command. And yet you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me, even though they are your enemies. How sad a substitute for the evil-doers!",49,18,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِءَادَمَ فَسَجَدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِۦٓ أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُۥ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُۥٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِى وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّۢ بِئْسَ لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ بَدَلًا,"Remember - O Messenger - when I said to the angels: Prostrate to Adam as a salutation. So all of them prostrated to him in fulfilment of the instruction of their Lord besides Iblis. He was one of the Jinn and was not an angel. He refused and was too proud to prostrate. Thus he went against following His Lord. Will you - O people - then take him and his children as friends with whom you align yourselves instead of Me, whilst they are your enemies! How do you take your enemies to be your friends? How bad and ugly is the act of the wrongdoers who make Satan their friend instead of befriending Allah!"
"I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray.",50,18,مَّآ أَشْهَدتُّهُمْ خَلْقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا خَلْقَ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا كُنتُ مُتَّخِذَ ٱلْمُضِلِّينَ عَضُدًا,"These whom you have taken as friends instead of me are all servants like you. I did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth when I created them. In fact, they were not even existent then. I did not make some of them witness the creation of others. I am alone in creation and planning. I would not take those human and jinn satans who lead others astray as my assistants as I am in no need of any assistants."
"The day He will say: ""Call those you had called My compeers,"" they will call them, but will get no response, and We shall place a gulf between them.",51,18,وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُوا۟ شُرَكَآءِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقًا,"Mention to them - O Messenger - the Day of Judgement, when Allah will say to those who had associated partners with Him in the world: Call My partners whom you claimed were partners to me so that they can help you. They will call them, but they will not answer their call and they will not come to their assistance. I will place between the worshippers and those whom they worshipped a pit of destruction, which will be for both groups, and this is the fire of Hell."
The sinners will see the Fire and know that they will be thrown into it and will not find a way of escape from it.,52,18,وَرَءَا ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ ٱلنَّارَ فَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُم مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُوا۟ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا,The idolaters will see the fire and they will be completely certain that they are going to fall into it. They will not find any place to escape to from it.
We have explained in various ways all things to men in this Qur'an; but of all things man is most contentious.,53,18,وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِى هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ لِلنَّاسِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَكْثَرَ شَىْءٍ جَدَلًا,"I have explained in different ways, in this Qur’ān that was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), many types of examples so that they will take a lesson and pay heed. But the thing that is most apparent in man - especially the disbeliever - is to wrongfully argue."
"There is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance has come to them, and asking for their Lord's forgiveness, unless they want the example of earlier people visited upon them, or the punishment to appear right before their eyes.",54,18,وَمَا مَنَعَ ٱلنَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوٓا۟ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّهُمْ إِلَّآ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ سُنَّةُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ قُبُلًا,"Nothing prevented the obstinate disbelievers from having faith in what Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought from his Lord. Lack of explanation did not prevent them from seeking Allah’s forgiveness for their sins, for many examples were given to them in the Qur’ān and clear proofs came to them. The only thing that prevented them was their stubborn request for the punishment of the previous communities to be imposed on them and for them to see the punishment that they were promised."
"We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn. But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth. They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned.",55,18,وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَيُجَٰدِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُوا۟ بِهِ ٱلْحَقَّ وَٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ ءَايَٰتِى وَمَآ أُنذِرُوا۟ هُزُوًا,"I do not send any of Our Messengers except to give good news to the people of faith and obedience and to warn the people of disbelief and disobedience. They do not have the authority to make hearts accept the guidance. Those who disbelieved in Allah dispute with the Messengers despite their having clear proof, in an attempt to use their falsehood to remove the truth that was sent down to Muhammad (peace be upon him). They made the Qur’ān and what they were warned of a joke and mockery."
"Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past. Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright.",56,18,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِۦ فَأَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا وَنَسِىَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا وَإِن تَدْعُهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَلَن يَهْتَدُوٓا۟ إِذًا أَبَدًا,"There is no one more oppressive that the person who was reminded of the verses of his Lord, but he did not pay any attention to the threat of punishment contained therein and he turned away from taking a lesson, forgetting the disbelief and sins he had done in his worldly life without repenting. I have placed on the hearts of people with this description covers that prevent them from understanding the Qur’ān, and in their ears deafness so that they cannot listen to it acceptingly. If you call them to faith they will never respond to what you call them towards as long as there are covers on their hearts and deafness in their ears."
"But your Lord is forgiving, full of benevolence. If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately. But a term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape.",57,18,وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ذُو ٱلرَّحْمَةِ لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُم بِمَا كَسَبُوا۟ لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦ مَوْئِلًا,"In order for the Prophet (peace be upon him) not to look forward to a hasty punishment for those who rejected him, Allah said to him: Your Lord - O Messenger - is One Who forgives the sins of those who repent, and One Whose Mercy encompasses everything. It is out of His mercy that he grants respite to sinners in order for them to repent to Him. If He was to punish these people who turn away, He would have hastened the punishment for them in the worldly life. But He is tolerant and merciful. He delayed the punishment so that they repent. They have an appointed time and place in which they will be recompensed for their disbelief and turning away if they do not repent, from which they will find no escape."
"As for these habitations, We destroyed them only when they transgressed; even so We had fixed a time for their annihilation.",58,18,وَتِلْكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ أَهْلَكْنَٰهُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُوا۟ وَجَعَلْنَا لِمَهْلِكِهِم مَّوْعِدًا,"Those disbelieving towns close to you such as the towns of the people of Hud, Salih and Shuayb —I destroyed them when they wronged themselves by disbelief and sins, and I set for their destruction an appointed time."
"When Moses said to his servant (Joshua): ""I will not give up till I reach the confluence of two oceans, or I will journey on and on.""",59,18,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِفَتَىٰهُ لَآ أَبْرَحُ حَتَّىٰٓ أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ أَوْ أَمْضِىَ حُقُبًا,"Remember - O Messenger - when Moses (peace be upon him) said to his servant, Joshua the son of Nun: I will continue travelling until I reach the place where the two seas meet, or I will travel until such time that I meet the righteous servant and I learn from him."
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.,60,18,فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا فَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُۥ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا,"So they both travelled and when they reached the place where the two seas meet, they forgot the fish that they had carried as provision. Allah gave life to that fish and it made a pathway in the sea like a tunnel, with which the water did not come together."
"When they had gone past (the confluence), Moses said to his servant: ""Give me my breakfast. I am exhausted from this journey.""",61,18,فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَا قَالَ لِفَتَىٰهُ ءَاتِنَا غَدَآءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا مِن سَفَرِنَا هَٰذَا نَصَبًا,"When they passed that place, Moses (peace be upon him) said to his servant: Bring us our lunch, we have experienced extreme tiredness in this journey."
"He said: ""You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea.""",62,18,قَالَ أَرَءَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَآ إِلَى ٱلصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّى نَسِيتُ ٱلْحُوتَ وَمَآ أَنسَىٰنِيهُ إِلَّا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُۥ وَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُۥ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ عَجَبًا,The boy said: Do you remember what happened when we rested by the rock? I forgot to tell you about the fish. It was only Satan who made me forget to mention it to you. The fish came to life and it amazingly found its way into the sea.
"Moses said: ""But that is exactly what we were seeking."" So they retraced their steps.",63,18,قَالَ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنَّا نَبْغِ فَٱرْتَدَّا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَارِهِمَا قَصَصًا,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to his servant: That is what we were looking for, for that is the sign of the place of the righteous servant. So they turned back retracing their steps, so that they do not lose the way until they reached the rock and from there the entry point of the fish."
"Then they found one of Our votaries, whom We had blessed and given knowledge from Us.",64,18,فَوَجَدَا عَبْدًا مِّنْ عِبَادِنَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَٰهُ مِن لَّدُنَّا عِلْمًا,"When they reached the place at which the fish was lost, they found there one of My righteous servants (who was Khidr peace be upon him), to whom I had given mercy, and to whom I had taught knowledge that people were not aware of, which is what is contained in this story."
"Moses said to him: ""May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way?""",65,18,قَالَ لَهُۥ مُوسَىٰ هَلْ أَتَّبِعُكَ عَلَىٰٓ أَن تُعَلِّمَنِ مِمَّا عُلِّمْتَ رُشْدًا,Moses humbly and politely said to him: May I follow you so that you can teach me some of the knowledge that Allah has taught you which constitutes guidance to the truth?
"He said: ""You will not be able to bear with me.",66,18,قَالَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِىَ صَبْرًا,"Khidr said: You will not be able to bear patience over what you see of my knowledge, because it will not correspond with your knowledge."
"""How can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension?""",67,18,وَكَيْفَ تَصْبِرُ عَلَىٰ مَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِۦ خُبْرًا,"How will you bear patience over the actions that you see for which you do not know the proper reason, because you judge them according to the limit of your knowledge?!"
"""You will find me patient if God wills,"" said Moses; ""and I will not disobey you in any thing.""",68,18,قَالَ سَتَجِدُنِىٓ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ صَابِرًا وَلَآ أَعْصِى لَكَ أَمْرًا,"Moses said: You will find me, Allah willing, to be patient over those actions of yours that I see and committed to following you. I will not go against any instruction that you give me."
"""If you must follow me,"" he said, ""do not ask me any thing until I speak of it to you myself.""",69,18,قَالَ فَإِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَنِى فَلَا تَسْـَٔلْنِى عَن شَىْءٍ حَتَّىٰٓ أُحْدِثَ لَكَ مِنْهُ ذِكْرًا,"Khidr said to Moses: If you follow me, then do not ask me about anything that you see me doing until I myself tell you the reason."
"So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) ""You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!""",70,18,فَٱنطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا رَكِبَا فِى ٱلسَّفِينَةِ خَرَقَهَا قَالَ أَخَرَقْتَهَا لِتُغْرِقَ أَهْلَهَا لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْـًٔا إِمْرًا,"When they agreed to that, they set out to the seashore where they came across a ship, which they boarded for free as an honour to Khidr. Khidr then made a hole in the ship by removing one of its planks. Moses said to him: Did you make a hole in the ship whose owners let us board for free in the hope that they may drown. You have done something confusing and puzzling."
"""Did I not tell you,"" he replied, ""that you will not be able to bear with me?""",71,18,قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِىَ صَبْرًا,Khidr said to Moses: Did I not say: You will not be able to bear patience over what you see me doing?!
"(Moses) said: ""Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult.""",72,18,قَالَ لَا تُؤَاخِذْنِى بِمَا نَسِيتُ وَلَا تُرْهِقْنِى مِنْ أَمْرِى عُسْرًا,Moses (peace be upon him) said to Khidr: Do not take me to task on account of my breaking the pledge forgetfully and do not make it difficult and hard for me to accompany you.
"The two went on till they came to a boy, whom he killed. Moses exclaimed: ""You have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life. You have done a most abominable thing!""",73,18,فَٱنطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلَٰمًا فَقَتَلَهُۥ قَالَ أَقَتَلْتَ نَفْسًا زَكِيَّةًۢ بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ لَّقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْـًٔا نُّكْرًا,"After they disembarked from the ship they set out walking along the seashore, when they saw a young boy who was still not an adult playing with the other boys. Khidr killed him and Moses said to him: Did you kill a pure soul that is still a minor for no sin? You have really done something evil!!"
"He said: ""Did I not tell you you will not be able to bear with me?""",74,18,قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِىَ صَبْرًا,"Khidr said to Moses (peace be upon him): “I had said To You: O Moses, you will never be able to bear the matter I will carry out”."
"Moses said: ""If I ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you. You have my apology.""",75,18,قَالَ إِن سَأَلْتُكَ عَن شَىْءٍۭ بَعْدَهَا فَلَا تُصَٰحِبْنِى قَدْ بَلَغْتَ مِن لَّدُنِّى عُذْرًا,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to Khidr: “Forgive me a second time. But if I ask you about anything after this time, then leave me, for you would have reached the limit, for which you can be excused for leaving my company, as I would have opposed your command three times”."
"The two went on till they came upon some villagers, and asked the people for food, but they refused to entertain them. There they found a wall that was crumbling, which he repaired. Moses remarked: ""You could have demanded wages for it if you liked.""",76,18,فَٱنطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَتَيَآ أَهْلَ قَرْيَةٍ ٱسْتَطْعَمَآ أَهْلَهَا فَأَبَوْا۟ أَن يُضَيِّفُوهُمَا فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ أَن يَنقَضَّ فَأَقَامَهُۥ قَالَ لَوْ شِئْتَ لَتَّخَذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا,"They then walked until they came to the people of a village from whom they asked for food, but the people of the village refused to feed them and fulfil the right of hospitality towards them. Then they found a wall in the village which was tilting, and about to fall and break. So Khidr fixed it until it was straight, so Moses (peace be upon him) said to Khidr: “If you wanted to take a wage for fixing it, you could have, as we need it after they have refused to host us”."
"""This is the parting of our ""ways,"" he said. ""But I will now explain the things you could not bear:",77,18,قَالَ هَٰذَا فِرَاقُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنِكَ سَأُنَبِّئُكَ بِتَأْوِيلِ مَا لَمْ تَسْتَطِع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْرًا,Khidr said to Moses: “This objection to my not taking a wage for erecting the wall is the point of separation between me and you. I shall inform you of the explanation of what you saw me doing but which you were unable to bear.
That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force.,78,18,أَمَّا ٱلسَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَٰكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ فَأَرَدتُّ أَنْ أَعِيبَهَا وَكَانَ وَرَآءَهُم مَّلِكٌ يَأْخُذُ كُلَّ سَفِينَةٍ غَصْبًا,"As for the ship which you criticised me for breaking, it belonged to some weak people who worked on the sea and who were unable to protect it. So I wanted to make it defective by what I did to it, so that it would not be taken by a king who was ahead of them and who would forcefully take possession of every good ship from its owners but leave every defective ship."
"As for the boy, his parents were believers, but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief.",79,18,وَأَمَّا ٱلْغُلَٰمُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَآ أَن يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَٰنًا وَكُفْرًا,"As for the boy you criticised me for killing, his parents were believers but he was an unbeliever according to Allah’s knowledge. So I feared that if he grew up, he would cause them to disbelieve in Allah out of their intense love for him or their intense need towards him."
We hoped their Lord would give them a substitute better than him in virtue and goodness.,80,18,فَأَرَدْنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْرًا مِّنْهُ زَكَوٰةً وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْمًا,"So I wanted Allah to replace them with a child better than him in religion, piety and purity from sins, and more merciful to his parents."
"As for that wall, it belonged to two orphan boys of the city, and their treasure was buried under it. Their father was an upright man. So your Lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their Lord. So, I did not do that of my own accord. This is the explanation of things you could not bear with patience.""",81,18,وَأَمَّا ٱلْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ لِغُلَٰمَيْنِ يَتِيمَيْنِ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ وَكَانَ تَحْتَهُۥ كَنزٌ لَّهُمَا وَكَانَ أَبُوهُمَا صَٰلِحًا فَأَرَادَ رَبُّكَ أَن يَبْلُغَآ أَشُدَّهُمَا وَيَسْتَخْرِجَا كَنزَهُمَا رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُهُۥ عَنْ أَمْرِى ذَٰلِكَ تَأْوِيلُ مَا لَمْ تَسْطِع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْرًا,"As for the wall which I fixed but you criticised me for fixing, it belonged to two young boys in the town we went to and whose father had passed away. Beneath the wall some wealth of theirs was buried. And the father of these two boys was pious. So your Lord intended, O Moses, that they reach the age of discerning and grow up, and take out their wealth which was buried underneath it, because if the wall were to fall now, their wealth would become exposed and go to waste. And this plan was your Lord’s mercy on them. And I did not do this of my own judgment. This is the explanation of what you were unable to bear”."
They ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnain.,82,18,وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَن ذِى ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ قُلْ سَأَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْهُ ذِكْرًا,"And the idolaters and Jews ask you to test you, O Messenger, regarding the one who had two horns (Dhu’l-Qarnayn). Say: I shall tell you some of his story which you can take lessons from and be reminded by."
"Say: ""I will cite before you his commemoration."" We gave him authority in the land and means of accomplishing every end.",83,18,إِنَّا مَكَّنَّا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ سَبَبًا,"I gave him position on earth and granted him of everything which is of relevance to his goals, a path by which he can reach his objective."
So he followed a certain road,84,18,فَأَتْبَعَ سَبَبًا,"So he took the means and paths leading to his objective that I had granted him, and then headed West."
"Till he reached the point of the setting sun, and saw it set behind a muddy lake, and near it found a people. We said: ""O Dhu'l-Qarnain, you may either punish them or treat them with kindness.""",85,18,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِى عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَوَجَدَ عِندَهَا قَوْمًا قُلْنَا يَٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّآ أَن تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّآ أَن تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْنًا,"And he travelled on earth until he reached the end of the land towards the setting place of the sun, seeing it as though it was setting in a hot spring of black clay. And he found an unbelieving people by the setting place of the sun. So I said to him, to test him: “O Dhu’l-Qarnayn, you can either punish these people by killing them or through other means, or you can be good to them”."
"He said: ""I shall punish whosoever is wicked. He will then be sent back to his Lord who will inflict on him a terrible punishment.",86,18,قَالَ أَمَّا مَن ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهُۥ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِۦ فَيُعَذِّبُهُۥ عَذَابًا نُّكْرًا,"Dhu’l-Qarnayn said: “As for the one who associates partners with Allah and persists in this, I shall punish him by killing him in this life, then he will return to his Lord on the Day of Judgment and He shall then punish him with a terrible punishment."
"But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him.""",87,18,وَأَمَّا مَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلَهُۥ جَزَآءً ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَسَنَقُولُ لَهُۥ مِنْ أَمْرِنَا يُسْرًا,"And as for the one who believes in Allah and does good deeds, for him is paradise, as a reward from your Lord for his faith and good deeds. And I shall say to him of my command that which contains ease and lenience”."
He then followed (another) road,88,18,ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَبًا,"Then he took a path different to his first route, heading towards the direction of the sunrise."
"Till he reached the point of the rising sun, and saw it rise over a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it.",89,18,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ لَّمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُم مِّن دُونِهَا سِتْرًا,"And he travelled until when he reached the place where the sun rises, he found it rising on a people I had not given any houses or the shade of trees to protect them from the sun."
"It was so, for We were fully informed about him.",90,18,كَذَٰلِكَ وَقَدْ أَحَطْنَا بِمَا لَدَيْهِ خُبْرًا,"This is the matter of Dhu’l-Qarnayn, and My knowledge has encompassed the power and strength he had."
He then followed (another) road,91,18,ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَبًا,"Then he followed a path different to the first two, spreading between the East and West."
"Till he reached a place between two mountains, and found this side of it a people who understood but little of what was spoken.",92,18,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّدَّيْنِ وَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمَا قَوْمًا لَّا يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ قَوْلًا,"And he travelled until he reached a gap between two mountains, and he found before them a people who could barely understand the speech of others."
"They said: 'O Dhu'l-Qarnain, Gog and Magog are oppressing the land. May we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them?""",93,18,قَالُوا۟ يَٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِنَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ مُفْسِدُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَهَلْ نَجْعَلُ لَكَ خَرْجًا عَلَىٰٓ أَن تَجْعَلَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ سَدًّا,"They said: “O Dhu’l-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog (meaning two great nations from the children of Adam) are causing corruption on earth by killing and so forth, so can we give you some wealth so you can make a barrier between us and them?”"
"He said: ""The ability my Lord has given me is better. So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them.",94,18,قَالَ مَا مَكَّنِّى فِيهِ رَبِّى خَيْرٌ فَأَعِينُونِى بِقُوَّةٍ أَجْعَلْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ رَدْمًا,"Dhu’l-Qarnayn said: “The kingdom and strength my Lord has given me is better than any wealth you can give me, so support me with men and tools. I shall make a barrier between you and them."
"Bring me ingots of iron,"" (which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up. ""Blow your bellows,"" he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot. ""Bring me molten brass,"" he said, ""that I may pour over it.""",95,18,ءَاتُونِى زُبَرَ ٱلْحَدِيدِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا سَاوَىٰ بَيْنَ ٱلصَّدَفَيْنِ قَالَ ٱنفُخُوا۟ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَعَلَهُۥ نَارًا قَالَ ءَاتُونِىٓ أُفْرِغْ عَلَيْهِ قِطْرًا,"Bring pieces of iron”. They brought them to him, so he began building with them between the two mountains, until when he had made them level with his building, he said to the workers: “Light these pieces”, until when the iron pieces turned red, he said: “Bring copper to pour on top of it”."
Thus (Gog and Magog) could neither climb over it nor dig a hole through (the rampart).,96,18,فَمَا ٱسْطَٰعُوٓا۟ أَن يَظْهَرُوهُ وَمَا ٱسْتَطَٰعُوا۟ لَهُۥ نَقْبًا,So Gog and Magog were unable to climb over it due to its height nor were they able to make a hole in it from beneath due to its hardness.
"""This is the benevolence of my Lord,"" he said; ""but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to a mound of dust; and the promise of my Lord is true.""",97,18,قَالَ هَٰذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى جَعَلَهُۥ دَكَّآءَ وَكَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى حَقًّا,"Dhu’l-Qarnayn said: “This barrier is a mercy from my Lord. It will come between Gog and Magog and causing corruption on earth, and it will stop them from it. Then when the time which Allah has appointed for their release comes before the Final Hour, He will level it to the ground. And the promise of Allah to level it to the ground and to release Gog and Magog is established and will not be broken”."
"We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together.",98,18,وَتَرَكْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَمُوجُ فِى بَعْضٍ وَنُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَجَمَعْنَٰهُمْ جَمْعًا,"And I shall leave Gog and Magog to crowd and mix with one another on the day the barrier breaks, due to their large numbers. And the Trumpet will be blown a second time, then I shall bring them all back to life. I shall gather their bones and meat which had scattered, then I shall bring them to the gathering place."
Then We shall bring Hell right before the infidels,99,18,وَعَرَضْنَا جَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَرْضًا,"And I shall present Hellfire to the unbelievers without any confusion, so they can see it clearly."
"Whose eyes were veiled against My warning, and they could not hear.",100,18,ٱلَّذِينَ كَانَتْ أَعْيُنُهُمْ فِى غِطَآءٍ عَن ذِكْرِى وَكَانُوا۟ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَمْعًا,"I shall present it to the disbelievers who were blind to the remembrance of Allah in the world, due to the veil which barred them from it, and they were unable to listen to and accept the verses of Allah."
Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels.,101,18,أَفَحَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا۟ عِبَادِى مِن دُونِىٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ نُزُلًا,"So did those who disbelieved in Allah think to make My servants among the angels, messengers and satans, gods besides me? I have prepared Hellfire as a residing place for the disbelievers."
"Say: ""Shall I tell you whose labour will be wasted?",102,18,قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِٱلْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَٰلًا,"Say - O Messenger: Shall we tell you, O people, which people are the biggest losers in their actions?"
"Theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasures of the world, even though they think they are doing good things.""",103,18,ٱلَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا,"Those who will see on the Day of Judgment that the effort they used to make in the world has gone to waste, whilst they thought they were doing well in their effort and that they will benefit from their actions. The reality was the exact opposite."
"They are those who reject the signs of their Lord, and the meeting with Him. So their good deeds will be fruitless, and on the Day of Judgement We shall not appoint any weighing for them.",104,18,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَآئِهِۦ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَزْنًا,"They are those who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord that prove His oneness and disbelieved in meeting Him, hence their actions became void due to their denial, and so they will not have any value with Allah on the Day of Judgment."
"Their requital will be Hell, because they disbelieved and mocked My signs and messengers.",105,18,ذَٰلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ بِمَا كَفَرُوا۟ وَٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ ءَايَٰتِى وَرُسُلِى هُزُوًا,"That recompense which is prepared for them is Hellfire, due to their denying Allah and making His revealed verses and His messengers a mockery."
"But surely those who believe and do the right will have gardens of Paradise as gift,",106,18,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتُ ٱلْفِرْدَوْسِ نُزُلًا,"Those who have faith in Allah and do good actions will have the highest of gardens, as a place to honour them."
"Where they will abide for ever, never wanting a change.",107,18,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا لَا يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلًا,"Staying therein forever, they will not want to move from there, as no reward can come close to it."
"Say: ""If the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my Lord, the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words (and wonders) of my Lord come to end, even if we brought another like it for replenishment.""",108,18,قُل لَّوْ كَانَ ٱلْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَٰتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ ٱلْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَٰتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِۦ مَدَدًا,"Say - O Messenger: the words of my Lord are many. If the ocean were to be ink to write them with, the ocean water would finish before His words come to an end, and if I were to bring more oceans they would also finish."
"Say: ""I am only a man like you, but it has been communicated to me that your Lord is one and single God, and that whosoever hopes to meet his Lord should do what is right, and not associate any one in the worship of his Lord.""",109,18,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِۦ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَٰلِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِۦٓ أَحَدًۢا,"Say - O Messenger: I am only a human like you, to whom it is revealed that your true god is One God who has no partner, namely Allah. Whoever fears meeting his Lord should do actions which conform with the sacred law, being sincere to his Lord in them, and should not associate any partner to his Lord in worship."
KAF HA YA 'AIN SAD.,0,19,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ كٓهيعٓصٓ,Kaf Ha Ya ‘Ayn Sad. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"Commemorate the beneficence of your Lord on Zachariah, His devotee,",1,19,ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ عَبْدَهُۥ زَكَرِيَّآ,"This is mention of your Lord’s mercy on His servant (peace be upon him), which I relate to you to take lessons from."
"When he called to his Lord inwardly,",2,19,إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥ نِدَآءً خَفِيًّا,"When he called on his Lord quietly, so that it is more likely to be accepted."
"And said: ""O my Lord, my bones decay, my head is white and hoary, yet in calling You, O Lord, I have never been deprived.",3,19,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَهَنَ ٱلْعَظْمُ مِنِّى وَٱشْتَعَلَ ٱلرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا وَلَمْ أَكُنۢ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيًّا,"He said: “My Lord, indeed my bones have become weak, the white hairs on my head have increased, and I was not unsuccessful in my supplicating You. In fact, every time I supplicated You, You accepted."
But I fear my relatives after me; and my wife is barren. So grant me a successor as a favour from You,4,19,وَإِنِّى خِفْتُ ٱلْمَوَٰلِىَ مِن وَرَآءِى وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِى عَاقِرًا فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيًّا,"And I feared that my relatives will not be able to fulfil the rights of the religion after my death, due to their engrossment in the worldly life. And my wife is barren, so grant me from Yourself a child to help me."
"Who will be heir to me, and heir to the house of Jacob; and make him obedient to You, O Lord.""",5,19,يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ وَٱجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيًّا,"He will inherit prophethood from me and inherit from the family of Jacob (peace be upon him), and O Lord, make him pleasant in his religion, character and knowledge”."
"""O Zachariah,"" (it was) said, ""We give you good news of a son by name of John.' To none have We attributed the name before.""",6,19,يَٰزَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلَٰمٍ ٱسْمُهُۥ يَحْيَىٰ لَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُۥ مِن قَبْلُ سَمِيًّا,"So Allah accepted his supplication and called out to him: “O Zechariah, I am informing you of what will please you. I have accepted your supplication and granted you a boy whose name will be John. I have not given this name to anyone before him”."
"""How can I have a son, O Lord"" he said, ""when my wife is barren and I am old and decrepit?""",7,19,قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِى غُلَٰمٌ وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِى عَاقِرًا وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ ٱلْكِبَرِ عِتِيًّا,"Zechariah said, amazed at the power of Allah: “How will a child be born to me when my wife is barren and I have reached the limit of old age and weakness of bones?”"
"(The angel) answered: ""Thus will it be. Your Lord said: 'This is easy for Me; for when I brought you into being you were nothing.'",8,19,قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْـًٔا,"The angel said: “The matter is as you have said, namely that your wife is barren and that you have reached the limit of old age and weakness of bones. However, your Lord said: For your Lord to create John from a barren mother and a father who has reached the extreme old age is easy. And I created you before this, O Zechariah, whilst you were not something to be mentioned as you were non-existent”."
"He said: ""O Lord, give me a token."" ""Though sound,"" He answered, ""you will not talk to any one for three nights running.""",9,19,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَل لِّىٓ ءَايَةً قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلَّا تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلَٰثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيًّا,"Zechariah (peace be upon him) said: “My Lord, give me a sign I can feel content with and which will show that the glad tiding given to me by the angels has been attained”. He said: “Your sign of having attained what you were given glad tidings of is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days, not due to any illness, but rather you will be sound and well”."
"So he came from the chamber to his people, and suggested to them (by signs) to sing the praises of the Lord morning and evening.",10,19,فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلْمِحْرَابِ فَأَوْحَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِمْ أَن سَبِّحُوا۟ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا,"Then Zechariah came out to his people from his place of prayer, and indicated to them without speaking to glorify Allah at the beginning and end of the day."
"(We said:) ""O John, hold fast to the Book;"" and We gave him wisdom right from boyhood,",11,19,يَٰيَحْيَىٰ خُذِ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِقُوَّةٍ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ ٱلْحُكْمَ صَبِيًّا,"Then John was born to him. Once he reached an age in which he could be addressed, I said to him: “O John, take the Torah firmly and with effort”. And I granted him understanding, knowledge, firmness, and resolve, whilst he was still a child."
"And compassion from Us, and goodness. So he was devout,",12,19,وَحَنَانًا مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَوٰةً وَكَانَ تَقِيًّا,"And I granted him mercy from myself and kept him pure from sins. And he was pious, abiding by the commands of Allah and refraining from His prohibitions."
"And kind to his parents, neither arrogant nor disobedient.",13,19,وَبَرًّۢا بِوَٰلِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُن جَبَّارًا عَصِيًّا,"And he was dutiful to his parents, soft with them and kind towards them. And he was neither arrogant regarding obedience to his Lord or his parents nor was he disobedient towards his Lord or his parents."
"So peace on him the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day that he will be raised from the dead.",14,19,وَسَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْهِ يَوْمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوْمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ يُبْعَثُ حَيًّا,"And peace and safety be on him from Allah on the day he was born, the day he shall die and leave this life, and on the day he shall be raised alive on the Day of Judgment. These three places are the most frightening a person goes through, so if he is safe in them, he shall not have any fear in any other place."
Commemorate Mary in the Book. When she withdrew from her family to a place in the East,15,19,وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ ٱنتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَانًا شَرْقِيًّا,"And mention, O Messenger, in the book revealed to you the story of Mary (peace be upon her), when she moved away from her family and stayed separately in a place to their east."
"And took cover from them, We sent a spirit of Ours to her who appeared before her in the concrete form of a man.",16,19,فَٱتَّخَذَتْ مِن دُونِهِمْ حِجَابًا فَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهَا رُوحَنَا فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَرًا سَوِيًّا,"Thus, she made for herself a veil from the people which would cover her, so that they cannot see her when she is worshipping her Lord. Then I sent Gabriel (peace be upon him) to her, thus he appeared to her in the form of a perfectly-formed human. So she thought he has a malicious intention towards her."
"""I seek refuge in the Merciful from you, if you fear Him,"" she said.",17,19,قَالَتْ إِنِّىٓ أَعُوذُ بِٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيًّا,"So when she saw him in the form of a perfectly-formed human heading towards her, she said: “I seek protection of the Merciful from you that any harm should come to me from you, if you are pious and fear Allah”."
"He replied: ""I am only a messenger from your Lord (sent) to bestow a good son on you.""",18,19,قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَٰمًا زَكِيًّا,Gabriel (peace be upon him) said: “I am not a human. I am only a Messenger from your Lord who He has sent to you for me to give you a good pure child”.
"""How can I have a son,"" she said, ""when no man has touched me, nor am I sinful?""",19,19,قَالَتْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِى غُلَٰمٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا,Mary said surprisingly: “How can I have a child when neither a husband nor anyone else has come near me nor am I an adulteress that I should have a child?”
"He said: ""Thus will it be. Your Lord said: 'It is easy for Me,' and that: 'We shall make him a sign for men and a blessing from Us.' This is a thing already decreed.""",20,19,قَالَ كَذَٰلِكِ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ وَلِنَجْعَلَهُۥٓ ءَايَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَكَانَ أَمْرًا مَّقْضِيًّا,"Gabriel said to her: “The matter is as you said, namely that no husband or anyone else has touched you nor are you an adulteress. However, your Lord said: ‘To create a child without a father is easy for Me. And it is so that the child granted to you is a sign for people of the power of Allah, and a mercy from Me to them, due to the good they will achieve through him. And the creation of this child of yours is a fixed decree from Allah and written in the Preserved Tablet’."
When she conceived him she went away to a distant place.,21,19,فَحَمَلَتْهُ فَٱنتَبَذَتْ بِهِۦ مَكَانًا قَصِيًّا,"So she conceived him after the angel blew into her, then she withdrew with him to a place far from the people."
"The birth pangs led her to the trunk of a date-palm tree. ""Would that I had died before this,"" she said, ""and become a thing forgotten, unremembered.""",22,19,فَأَجَآءَهَا ٱلْمَخَاضُ إِلَىٰ جِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ قَالَتْ يَٰلَيْتَنِى مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَٰذَا وَكُنتُ نَسْيًا مَّنسِيًّا,"And the pangs of childbirth struck her and made her take refuge by the trunk of a date tree. Mary said: “If only I had died before this day and I was something not even mentioned, so that bad is not thought of me”."
"Then (a voice) called to her from below: ""Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.",23,19,فَنَادَىٰهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ أَلَّا تَحْزَنِى قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيًّا,Then Gabriel called to her from the bottom of the valley: “Do not grieve. Your Lord has made for you a spring of water beneath you from which you can drink.
"Shake the trunk of the date-palm tree, and it will drop ripe dates for you.",24,19,وَهُزِّىٓ إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ تُسَٰقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَبًا جَنِيًّا,And hold the trunk of the tree and shake it; it will instantly drop fresh ripe dates on you.
"Eat and drink, and be at peace. If you see any man, tell him: 'I have verily vowed a fast to Ar-Rahman and cannot speak to any one this day.'",25,19,فَكُلِى وَٱشْرَبِى وَقَرِّى عَيْنًا فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ ٱلْبَشَرِ أَحَدًا فَقُولِىٓ إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ صَوْمًا فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنسِيًّا,"So eat of the ripe dates, drink of the water, and be pleased with your child and do not grieve. And if you see any person who asks you regarding the child, say to him: ‘I have bound myself to silence for my Lord’s sake, so I will not speak to any person today’”."
"Then she brought the child to her people. They exclaimed: ""O Mary, you have done a most astonishing thing!",26,19,فَأَتَتْ بِهِۦ قَوْمَهَا تَحْمِلُهُۥ قَالُوا۟ يَٰمَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْـًٔا فَرِيًّا,"Then Mary came carrying her child to her people. Her people said to her out of shock: “O Mary, you have committed a grave fabricated matter, by bringing a child without a father."
"O sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked person, nor your mother sinful!""",27,19,يَٰٓأُخْتَ هَٰرُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ ٱمْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا,"O one who resembles Aaron (a righteous man) in worship, your father was not an adulterer nor was your mother. You are from a pure household known to be righteous, so how can you bring a child without a father?”"
"But she pointed towards him. ""How can we talk to one,"" they said, ""who is only an infant in the cradle?""",28,19,فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ قَالُوا۟ كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِى ٱلْمَهْدِ صَبِيًّا,She pointed towards her son Jesus (peace be upon him) who was in the cradle. So the people said in surprise: “How can we talk to a child who is in the cradle?”
"""I am a servant of God,"" he answered. ""He has given me a Book and made me a prophet,",29,19,قَالَ إِنِّى عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ ءَاتَىٰنِىَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيًّا,Jesus (peace be upon him) said: “I am the servant of Allah. He gave me the Gospel and made me one of His prophets.
"And blessed me wherever I may be, and enjoined on me worship and zakat for as long as I live,",30,19,وَجَعَلَنِى مُبَارَكًا أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ وَأَوْصَٰنِى بِٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَٱلزَّكَوٰةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيًّا,And He made me a great benefit for the servants wherever I am. And He ordered me to perform prayer and give Zakat for as long as I live.
And be dutiful to my mother. He has not made me haughty or rebellious.,31,19,وَبَرًّۢا بِوَٰلِدَتِى وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِى جَبَّارًا شَقِيًّا,And He made me righteous to my mother. And He did not make me arrogant towards the obedience of my Lord nor did He make me disobedient to her.
"There was peace on me the day I was born, and will be the day I die, and on the day I will be raised from the dead.""",32,19,وَٱلسَّلَٰمُ عَلَىَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدتُّ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ حَيًّا,"And safety from the satans and his helpers is on me on the day of my birth, the day of my death and the day I shall be raised on the Day of Judgment. The satan has no evil effect on me in these three frightening places”."
"This was Jesus, son of Mary: A true account they contend about.",33,19,ذَٰلِكَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ ٱلْحَقِّ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ,"He who is described with these qualities is Jesus, son of Mary. And this discussion is the word of truth regarding him, not that which is said by the misguided who doubt and disagree in his affair."
"It does not behove God to have a son. Too immaculate is He! When He decrees a thing He has only to say: ""Be"", and it is.",34,19,مَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥٓ إِذَا قَضَىٰٓ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"It does not befit Allah to have a son, exalted and free He is from this. When He intends something, it is enough for Him to say regarding this thing: Be, and it most definitely becomes. So He who is like this is free from having a son."
"(Jesus only said:) ""Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path.""",35,19,وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"And Allah, may He be glorified, is both my Lord and your Lord, so make worship sincere for Him alone. This which I have mentioned to you is the straight path that leads to the pleasure of Allah."
Yet the sectarians differed among themselves. Alas for the unbelievers when they see the Terrible Day!,36,19,فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلْأَحْزَابُ مِنۢ بَيْنِهِمْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن مَّشْهَدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"But the factions of Jews and Christians differed regarding the matter of Jesus (peace be upon him). The Jews said about him that he is a magician. Some Christians said about him that he is the son of Allah. Woe to those who differ regarding him, from witnessing the great Day of Judgment, due to its scenes, reckoning and punishment."
"How keenly would they hear and see when they come before Us then, even though today the evil-doers are lost in palpable error.",37,19,أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَٰكِنِ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ ٱلْيَوْمَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"How horrible is what they will hear and see on the Day of Judgment, and how severe it will be for them. And how strange will be their condition which you will see. However, the oppressors in this worldly life are clearly misguided from the straight path. They will not prepare for the afterlife until it will suddenly come to them whilst they are in their wrongdoing."
"Warn them of that day of pining when all matters will have been settled, though they would still be unaware and unbelieving (of the truth).",38,19,وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِىَ ٱلْأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"And warn the people, O Messenger, of the Day of Regret when the evildoer will regret his evil-doings and when the righteous will regret not being more obedient, when the scrolls of the servants will be wrapped, their reckoning is finished and each person goes towards what he had sent forward. But they have been deceived by their worldly life and are unmindful of the Hearafter, and they do not accept the Day of Judgment."
"Verily We shall inherit the earth and whosoever is on it, and to Us they will return.",39,19,إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَرِثُ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ,"I am the one who will remain after the creation has perished. I shall inherit the earth and those on it, because they will have perished and I will remain after them, and I own them and do with them as I want. To Me alone they shall return on the Day of Judgment to be reckoned and recompensed."
"Commemorate Abraham in the Book: He was upright, a prophet.",40,19,وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ صِدِّيقًا نَّبِيًّا,"And mention, O Messenger, in the Qur’ān which has been revealed to you the story of Abraham (peace be upon him). He was very truthful and firmly believed the signs of Allah."
"Remember, when he said to his father: ""O my father, why do you worship that which can neither hear nor see nor even profit you the least?",41,19,إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ يَٰٓأَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ وَلَا يُغْنِى عَنكَ شَيْـًٔا,"When he said to his father Azar: “O father, why do you worship besides Allah an idol which does not hear your supplication if you supplicate it, does not see your worship when you worship it, does not remove harm from you and does not bring any benefit to you?"
"O my father, to me has come such knowledge as never came to you. So follow me that I may show you the right path.",42,19,يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّى قَدْ جَآءَنِى مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَمْ يَأْتِكَ فَٱتَّبِعْنِىٓ أَهْدِكَ صِرَٰطًا سَوِيًّا,"O father, such knowledge has come to me through revelation which has not come to you, so follow me and I shall guide you to the straight path."
"Why do you worship Satan, O father? Verily Satan was disobedient to Ar-Rahman.",43,19,يَٰٓأَبَتِ لَا تَعْبُدِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ عَصِيًّا,"O father, do not worship the satan by obeying him. The satan is disobedient to the Merciful, as He ordered him to prostrate to Adam but he did not prostrate."
"O my father, I fear lest a punishment from Ar-Rahman should befall you, and you should become a friend of the Devil.""",44,19,يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ أَن يَمَسَّكَ عَذَابٌ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ فَتَكُونَ لِلشَّيْطَٰنِ وَلِيًّا,"O father, I fear a punishment from the Merciful will afflict you if you die in your disbelief, then you will be a companion to him in punishment due to your befriending him”."
"He said: ""Are you averse to my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I shall have you stoned to death. So go away for a while from me.""",45,19,قَالَ أَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنْ ءَالِهَتِى يَٰٓإِبْرَٰهِيمُ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهِ لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ وَٱهْجُرْنِى مَلِيًّا,"Azar said to his son Abraham (peace be upon him): “Are you turning away from the idols I worship, O Abraham? If you do not stop criticising my idols, I shall pelt you with stones. Leave me for a long time. Do not talk to me or be with me”."
"He answered: ""Peace be on you. I will seek forgiveness of my Lord for you. He has been gracious to me.",46,19,قَالَ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكَ سَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ بِى حَفِيًّا,Abraham (peace be upon him) said to his father: “Greetings of peace to you from me. You will not face from me what you dislike. I shall seek forgiveness and guidance from my Lord for you. He is very kind to me.
"I will leave you and those you invoke apart from God, and pray to my Lord. Haply in praying to my Lord I will not be deprived.""",47,19,وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَدْعُوا۟ رَبِّى عَسَىٰٓ أَلَّآ أَكُونَ بِدُعَآءِ رَبِّى شَقِيًّا,"And I shall leave you and leave the idols you worship besides Allah, and I shall call upon my Lord alone, without associating any partner with Him. Perhaps He will not deprive me if I pray to Him, otherwise I will be unsuccessful in praying to Him."
"Thus, when he left them and the (idols) they worshipped, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet,",48,19,فَلَمَّا ٱعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُۥٓ إِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلًّا جَعَلْنَا نَبِيًّا,"So when he left them and their gods they used to worship besides Allah, I replaced for him his loss of family, and so I gave him his son Isaac and I gave him his grandson Jacob. And each one of them I made a prophet."
"And bestowed on them some of Our blessings, and gave them high renown.",49,19,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُم مِّن رَّحْمَتِنَا وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ عَلِيًّا,"And out of My mercy, I gave them much good alongside prophethood. And I established for them good praise which remains on the tongues of people."
"Commemorate Moses in the Book. He was a chosen one, both an apostle and a prophet.",50,19,وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ مُخْلَصًا وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَّبِيًّا,"And mention, O Messenger, in the Qur’ān revealed to you the story of Moses (peace be upon him). He was chosen and selected, and he was a Messenger and prophet."
"We called him from the right side of the Mount, and brought him close for communion;",51,19,وَنَٰدَيْنَٰهُ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلْأَيْمَنِ وَقَرَّبْنَٰهُ نَجِيًّا,"I called him from the side of the mountain that was on the right in relation to where Moses (peace be upon him) was, and I brought him near in communion, where Allah let him hear His speech."
"And bestowed on him his brother Aaron, a prophet, through Our benevolence.",52,19,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَآ أَخَاهُ هَٰرُونَ نَبِيًّا,"I gave him, out of My grace and favour, his brother Aaron (peace be upon him) as a prophet, in answer to his prayer when he asked his Lord for that."
"Commemorate Ishmael in the Book. He was true of his promise, and a messenger, a prophet.",53,19,وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ إِسْمَٰعِيلَ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ صَادِقَ ٱلْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَّبِيًّا,"And mention, O Messenger, in the Qur’ān revealed to you, the story of Ishmael (peace be upon him). He was true to his promise - whenever he made a promise he fulfilled it - and he was a messenger and prophet."
"He enjoined on his household worship and zakat, and he was obedient to his Lord.",54,19,وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُۥ بِٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَٱلزَّكَوٰةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ مَرْضِيًّا,"He used to instruct his household to keep up the prayer and to give Zakat, and his Lord was well pleased with him."
"Commemorate Enoch in the Book. He was a truthful person and a prophet,",55,19,وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ إِدْرِيسَ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ صِدِّيقًا نَّبِيًّا,"And mention, O Messenger, in the Qur’ān which has been revealed to you, the story of Idris (peace be upon him). He was very truthful and firmly believed in the signs of his Lord, and he was one of the prophets of Allah."
And We raised him to an exalted station.,56,19,وَرَفَعْنَٰهُ مَكَانًا عَلِيًّا,I raised his mention by the prophethood I gave him and he therefore was of a high rank.
"These are (some of) those who were favoured by God among the prophets of the progeny of Adam, and of those We bore in the ark with Noah, and the offspring of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and We chose, for they bowed weeping in adoration when the revelations of Ar-Rahman were recited to them.",57,19,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءَادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَٱجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ خَرُّوا۟ سُجَّدًا وَبُكِيًّا,"Those who were mentioned in this Sūrah, beginning with Zachariah and ending with Idris (peace be upon them) are the ones whom Allah blessed with prophethood, from the children of Adam (peace be upon him), and from the children of those whom I carried in the Ark with Noah (peace be upon him), and from the children of Abraham and the children of Jacob (peace be upon them), and from those whom I blessed with guidance to Islam and whom I chose and made prophets. When they heard the verses of Allah being recited, they prostrated to Allah, weeping out of His fear."
"But they are succeeded by a generation who neglect their devotional obligations and follow only earthly pleasures; but they will reach the wrong road and meet destruction,",58,19,فَخَلَفَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا,"After these chosen prophets came followers of evil and deviation, who neglected prayer by not offering it in the required manner, and who perpetrated sins driven by their own desires such as fornication. These people will come face to face with evil and disappointment in Hell."
Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right. These will enter Paradise and will not be wronged the least,59,19,إِلَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ شَيْـًٔا,"But those who repented from their neglect and excess, who had faith in Allah, and who did righteous deeds; those who possess such attributes will enter Paradise and the reward of their actions will not be reduced in the least."
In the gardens of Eden promised by Ar-Rahman to His creatures in the unknown (future). Verily His promise will come to pass.,60,19,جَنَّٰتِ عَدْنٍ ٱلَّتِى وَعَدَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ عِبَادَهُۥ بِٱلْغَيْبِ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ وَعْدُهُۥ مَأْتِيًّا,"Gardens of residence and permanence, which the Merciful promised His servants in the Ghaib that He will make them enter them. They did not see them but they believed in them. Allah’s promise of Paradise - even though it is in the Ghaib - will most certainly come to pass."
"They will hear no vain talk there, but only salutations of peace, and they will have their sustenance morning and evening.""",61,19,لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا إِلَّا سَلَٰمًا وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا,There they will not hear anything futile nor any obscene talk. Instead they will hear the greeting of peace to one another and the greeting of peace from the angels to them. They will be given whatever type of food they desire in the morning and evening.
This is the Paradise those of Our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear the displeasure of God.,62,19,تِلْكَ ٱلْجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيًّا,"This Paradise, described with the above attributes, is the one that I will give to those of My servants who fulfilled the Commandments and avoided the Prohibitions."
"""We do not come down,"" (will the angels say) ""but only by your Lord's command."" To Him belongs whatever lies before us and behind us, and the space in between. Your Lord does not ever forget:",63,19,وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلَّا بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ لَهُۥ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا وَمَا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيًّا,"And say - O Gabriel - to Muhammad (peace be upon him): The angels do not descent of their own accord. They only descend at Allah’s command. Everything ahead of us in the Hearafter, everything behind us in the world, and everything in between the world and the Hearafter, all belong to Allah. Your Lord, O Messenger, would not forget anything."
"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. Therefore worship Him, and be constant in His worship. Do you know any namesake of His?",64,19,رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَٱعْبُدْهُ وَٱصْطَبِرْ لِعِبَٰدَتِهِۦ هَلْ تَعْلَمُ لَهُۥ سَمِيًّا,"He is the Creator of the heavens and the Creator of the earth and their Owner and Controller. He is also the Creator, Owner and Controller of everything in between them so worship Him alone, for He alone is deserving of worship. Remain firm in worshipping Him, for He has no likeness or partner who shares this worship with Him."
"Yet man says: ""When I am dead, will I come to life again?""",65,19,وَيَقُولُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَءِذَا مَا مِتُّ لَسَوْفَ أُخْرَجُ حَيًّا,"The disbeliever, who rejects resurrection, mockingly says: What, when I die, I will come out of my grave alive for a second time? This is far-fetched."
Does man not remember that before We created him he was nothing?,66,19,أَوَلَا يَذْكُرُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَٰهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ يَكُ شَيْـًٔا,"Does this person who rejects resurrection not remember that I created him previously when he was nothing? He can then use the first creation as evidence for the second creation, even though the second creation will be simpler and easier?"
"By your Lord, We shall gather them and the devils together, then bring them crawling on their knees around Hell.",67,19,فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحْشُرَنَّهُمْ وَٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ ثُمَّ لَنُحْضِرَنَّهُمْ حَوْلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيًّا,"By your Lord, O Messenger, I will take them out of their graves to the place of gathering along with the satans who had misled them. Then I will push them towards the doors of Hell, humiliated and on their knees."
We shall pull out of every section those who were most perversely rebellious against Ar-Rahman.,68,19,ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ عِتِيًّا,"I shall violently pull out from each of the groups of deviation those who were most disobedient, and these are their leaders."
We know best who deserve to be burnt in (the Fire).,69,19,ثُمَّ لَنَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِهَا صِلِيًّا,Then I know best about those who most deserve to enter the Fire and endure and suffer its heat.
There is not one among you who will not reach it. Your Lord has made this incumbent on Himself.,70,19,وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَّقْضِيًّا,There is not one among you - O people - who will not cross over the bridge placed over Hell. Your Lord has made this crossing an incumbent decree and no one can push back His decree.
"We shall deliver those who took heed for themselves, and leave the evil-doers kneeling there.",71,19,ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوا۟ وَّنَذَرُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيًّا,"Then after this crossing over the bridge, I will deliver those who were mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, and I will leave the wrongdoers kneeling on their knees without being able to escape from it."
"When Our lucid revelations are read out to them, the infidels say to those who believe: ""Which of the two groups is better in standing, and whose company is more excellent?""",72,19,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَىُّ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ خَيْرٌ مَّقَامًا وَأَحْسَنُ نَدِيًّا,"When My clear revelations to My Messenger are recited to people, the disbelievers say to the believers:   Which of our two parties is better in residence and dwelling and superior in assembly and gathering: Our party or your party?"
How many generations that had far more wealth and ostentation have We laid low before them!,73,19,وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّن قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَحْسَنُ أَثَٰثًا وَرِءْيًا,"How many were the nations that I destroyed before these disbelievers who are proud of their material superiority, who had surpassed them in riches and in their outward appearance due to their expensive clothing and their bodily luxuries."
"Say: ""Ar-Rahman extends the life of those who are astray until they come to realise what had been promised them was either (physical) affliction or (the terror) of Resurrection. Then will they know who is worse in position, and who is weak in supporters.",74,19,قُلْ مَن كَانَ فِى ٱلضَّلَٰلَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ لَهُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ مَدًّا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا رَأَوْا۟ مَا يُوعَدُونَ إِمَّا ٱلْعَذَابَ وَإِمَّا ٱلسَّاعَةَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ شَرٌّ مَّكَانًا وَأَضْعَفُ جُندًا,"Say - O Messenger: The Merciful will grant respite to those wallowing in their misguidance, so that they fall further into it, until when they see what they have been warned about- either the swift punishment in this world or the punishment postponed to the Day of Judgment - then they will realise who is worse situated and who has the weakest forces. Is it their party or the party of the believers."
"God gives greater guidance to those who are guided; and good deeds that endure are better with your Lord for reward, and better for consequence.",75,19,وَيَزِيدُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱهْتَدَوْا۟ هُدًى وَٱلْبَٰقِيَٰتُ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ مَّرَدًّا,"In contrast to the respite granted to those people so that they fall further into misguidance, Allah gives more guidance and obedience to those who are guided. Righteous deeds that lead to perpetual happiness are more beneficial - in the sight of your Lord, O messenger, in terms of their recompense and have a better outcome."
"Have you seen him who denies Our revelations, and says: ""I will certainly be given wealth and children.""",76,19,أَفَرَءَيْتَ ٱلَّذِى كَفَرَ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَقَالَ لَأُوتَيَنَّ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا,"Have you, O messenger, seen the man who denies My evidences, rejects My warning and says: If I die and am resurrected, I will certainly be given a lot of wealth and children?"
"Has he peeped into the Unknown, or obtained a promise from Ar-Rahman?",77,19,أَطَّلَعَ ٱلْغَيْبَ أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا,Does he have knowledge of the Ghaib and therefore he said that with some proof? Or does he have a pledge with his Lord to enter him into paradise and to give him wealth and children?
"Never so. We shall certainly write down what he says, and prolong the extent of his punishment.",78,19,كَلَّا سَنَكْتُبُ مَا يَقُولُ وَنَمُدُّ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ مَدًّا,The matter is not as he claimed. I will certainly record what he says and does; and I will give him a punishment over and above his punishment because of the falsehood that he claims.
"All that he claims will revert to Us, and he will come before Us all alone.",79,19,وَنَرِثُهُۥ مَا يَقُولُ وَيَأْتِينَا فَرْدًا,"I shall inherit the wealth and children he leaves behind after I destroy him, and he will come to Us on the Day of Judgement all alone, with the wealth and fame that he enjoyed having been taken away from him."
They have taken other gods apart from God that they might be a strength to them.,80,19,وَٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُوا۟ لَهُمْ عِزًّا,"The idolaters have taken for themselves things of worship other than Allah, so that they may be a support and source of assistance for them."
Never. They will deny their devotion and become their adversaries.,81,19,كَلَّا سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا,The matter is not as they claimed. These things that they worshipped besides Allah will reject the idolaters’ worship of them on the Day of Judgment. They will disassociate themselves from them and become their enemies.
Do you not see that We have set the devils against the infidels to rouse and instigate them?,82,19,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزًّا,"Have you, O Messenger, not seen that I sent the satans and gave them authority over the disbelievers inciting them to commit sins and prevent others from Allah’s religion?"
"So, do not be hasty with them. We are counting their number (of days).",83,19,فَلَا تَعْجَلْ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّمَا نَعُدُّ لَهُمْ عَدًّا,"Do not be hasty, O Messenger, in asking Allah to punish them quickly. I am keeping a close record of their lives, until when the period of their respite comes to an end, I will punish them with what they deserve."
"The day We shall usher the righteous before Ar-Rahman like envoys into the presence of a king,",84,19,يَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَفْدًا,"Remember, O Messenger, the Day of Judgment when I will gather those who were mindful of their Lord - by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions - to their Lord as a delegation that is honoured and respected."
"And drive the wicked into Hell like cattle driven to water,",85,19,وَنَسُوقُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وِرْدًا,I will drive the disbelievers to Hell thirsty.
None will have power to intercede for them except one who obtains a promise from Ar-Rahman.,86,19,لَّا يَمْلِكُونَ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةَ إِلَّا مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا,"These disbelievers will not have the power to intercede for one another, except for those who had taken a pledge with Allah in the world by having faith in Him and in His messengers."
"They say: ""God has begotten a son.""",87,19,وَقَالُوا۟ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا,"The Jews, the Christians and some of the idolaters said: The Merciful has taken a son."
You have uttered a grievous thing,88,19,لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْـًٔا إِدًّا,You - who say this - have indeed brought something monstrous.
"Which would cleave the skies asunder, rend the earth, and split the mountains,",89,19,تَكَادُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ ٱلْجِبَالُ هَدًّا,"The heavens almost rupture because of this detested statement, the earth almost splits, and the mountains almost fall in ruins."
"For they have attributed a son to Ar-Rahman,",90,19,أَن دَعَوْا۟ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا,All of this because they have attributed a son to the Merciful. Allah is high above that by far.
When it does not behove the Merciful to have a son.,91,19,وَمَا يَنۢبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا,It is not befitting of the Merciful to take a son as He is pure of that.
There is no one in the heavens and the earth but comes before Ar-Rahman in all obedience.,92,19,إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّآ ءَاتِى ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا,"There is no angel, human being or jinn in the heavens and earth but that he will come in submission to his Lord on the Day of Judgment."
He has counted them and calculated their number.,93,19,لَّقَدْ أَحْصَىٰهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدًّا,He has full knowledge of them and has numbered them exactly. Nothing of theirs is hidden from Him.
Every one of them will come before Him all alone on the Day of Resurrection.,94,19,وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فَرْدًا,"Each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Judgment alone, without any helper or any wealth."
Surely Ar-Rahman will show love for those who believe and do the right.,95,19,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ وُدًّا,"Those who have faith in Allah, and do righteous actions that Allah is pleased with, Allah will create for them love by His loving them and by making them beloved to His servants."
"So We have made this (Qur'an) easy in your tongue that you may give good news to those who take heed, and warn the people who are contentious.",96,19,فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَٰهُ بِلِسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنذِرَ بِهِۦ قَوْمًا لُّدًّا,"We have made this Qur’ān easy by revealing it in your own language, O Messenger, so that you may bring glad news to those who are mindful by fulfilling My instructions and avoiding My prohibitions, and so that you may warn a people who are harsh in disputing and stubborn in accepting the truth."
"How many generations have We laid low before them. Do you see any sign of them, or hear the least whisper of them?",97,19,وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّن قَرْنٍ هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزًۢا,"How many communities I have destroyed before your people! Do you perceive a single one of those communities today, or hear any sound from them? What afflicted them may afflict others when Allah gives permission."
TA HA.,0,20,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ طه,"This sūrah begins with the disconnected letters, the explanation for which has already preceeded in Sūrah Baqarah."
"We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened,",1,20,مَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَىٰٓ,"I have not revealed the Qur’ān to you, O Messenger, to become distressed by your people’s turning away from having faith in it."
But as admonition for him who fears --,2,20,إِلَّا تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ,We only revealed it to be a reminder for those whom Allah has blessed so that they fear Him.
"A revelation from Him who created the earth and the high ascending skies,",3,20,تَنزِيلًا مِّمَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱلْعُلَى,"It was sent down by Allah, Who created the earth and the high heavens. It is thus a grand Qur’ān, as it was sent down by a Grand Being."
"The ever-merciful, established on the throne (of authority).",4,20,ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱسْتَوَىٰ,"The Merciful who established Himself on the Throne, in a meaning that is befitting for His Majesty, may He be glorified."
"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth and in between them, belongs to Him, as whatever lies under the earth.",5,20,لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمَا تَحْتَ ٱلثَّرَىٰ,"Everything in the heavens and on earth, and all that is beneath the soil, belong to Him alone, may He be glorified. He created, owns and controls all of it."
"Whether you say a thing aloud or inaudibly, He has knowledge of the secret and the hidden.",6,20,وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِٱلْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُۥ يَعْلَمُ ٱلسِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى,"If you, O Messenger, proclaim the word or conceal it, He, may He be glorified, knows all of that. He knows the secrets and what is even more hidden, such as thoughts in the mind. Nothing is hidden from Him."
God: There is no god but He. To Him belong the attributes most beautiful.,7,20,ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ لَهُ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ,"Allah, there is no being deserving of worship besides Him. To Him alone belong the perfect Names that have reached the most complete level of perfection and excellence."
Has the story of Moses come to you?,8,20,وَهَلْ أَتَىٰكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰٓ,"The story of Moses, son of Imran, (peace be upon him), has come to you - O Messenger."
"When he saw a fire he said to his family: ""You wait here. I have seen a fire. I may haply be able to bring an ember from it, or find direction by the fire.""",9,20,إِذْ رَءَا نَارًا فَقَالَ لِأَهْلِهِ ٱمْكُثُوٓا۟ إِنِّىٓ ءَانَسْتُ نَارًا لَّعَلِّىٓ ءَاتِيكُم مِّنْهَا بِقَبَسٍ أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ هُدًى,When he saw a fire whilst travelling and he said to his family: Stay here––I can see a fire. Maybe I can bring you a flaming brand from it or find somebody to guide me to the path.
"When he approached it, a voice called out:",10,20,فَلَمَّآ أَتَىٰهَا نُودِىَ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ,"When he came to the fire, Allah, may He be glorified, called out to him saying: O Moses."
"""O Moses, I am verily your Lord, so take off your shoes, for you are in the holy plain of Towa.",11,20,إِنِّىٓ أَنَا۠ رَبُّكَ فَٱخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ بِٱلْوَادِ ٱلْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى,I am your Lord. Take off your shoes in preparation for your conversation with me. You are in the purified valley (of Tuwa.)

So worship Me alone and perform the prayer in the perfect manner so that you may remember Me in it.
Verily the Hour (of the great change) is about to come. I keep it secret that every soul may be rewarded for its endeavour.,14,20,إِنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا لِتُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍۭ بِمَا تَسْعَىٰ,"The Hour is most definitely coming and it will certainly occur. I almost keep it hidden so that no creation knows its time, but they are aware of its signs by the information given to them by the Prophet sent to them, so that each soul is rewarded for what it did, whether good or evil."
"So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it.",15,20,فَلَا يَصُدَّنَّكَ عَنْهَا مَن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ فَتَرْدَىٰ,Do not let those disbelievers who do not believe in it and who follow their unlawful desires distract you from believing in it and preparing for it by doing righteous action and so bring you to ruin on account of it.
"What is that in your right band, O Moses?""",16,20,وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"What is that in your right hand, O Moses?"
"""It's my staff,"" he answered; ""I lean on it, and fell leaves for my goats with it, and I have other uses for it.""",17,20,قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا۟ عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَىٰ غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَـَٔارِبُ أُخْرَىٰ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said: It is my stick: I lean on it when walking, I beat down tree leaves with it for my sheep, and it has many other uses besides those I mentioned."

"""Catch it,"" said He, ""and have no fear; We shall revert it to its former state.",20,20,قَالَ خُذْهَا وَلَا تَخَفْ سَنُعِيدُهَا سِيرَتَهَا ٱلْأُولَىٰ,Allah said to Moses (peace be upon him): Take hold of the stick and do not fear its having turned into a snake. When you take hold of it I will return it to its former state.
"And face what is to come with patience, your hand will not be tarnished with blame: Another sign",21,20,وَٱضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَىٰ جَنَاحِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوٓءٍ ءَايَةً أُخْرَىٰ,"Now press your hand to your side and it will come out white, without any leprosy; that is another sign for you."

"He answered: ""Granted is your prayer, O Moses.",35,20,قَالَ قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"Allah said: I have granted your request, O Moses."
We have bestowed Our favour on you before this,36,20,وَلَقَدْ مَنَنَّا عَلَيْكَ مَرَّةً أُخْرَىٰٓ,I had favoured you another time.
When We told your mother what We relate:,37,20,إِذْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أُمِّكَ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ,When We inspired your mother by that which was a means by which Allah protected you from Pharaoh’s plot.
"'Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river. The river will cast it on the bank. An enemy of Ours, and his, will retrieve it.' We bestowed Our love on you that you may be reared under Our eyes.",38,20,أَنِ ٱقْذِفِيهِ فِى ٱلتَّابُوتِ فَٱقْذِفِيهِ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ فَلْيُلْقِهِ ٱلْيَمُّ بِٱلسَّاحِلِ يَأْخُذْهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّى وَعَدُوٌّ لَّهُۥ وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَىٰ عَيْنِىٓ,"I had instructed her when I inspired her: Throw your child after he is born into the chest and then place the chest into the river. The river will cast him on to the bank by My command, and he will be taken in by an enemy of Mine and his, who is Pharaoh. I placed on you love from Me, so that people love you, and so that you are reared under My watchful eye, protection and care."
"Then your sister followed you, and said (to the people who had retrieved the child): 'Should I guide you to a person who can nurse him?' We thus brought you back to your mother that her heart may be cheered, and she may not grieve. (Remember) when you killed a man We saved you from anguish; and tested and steeled you (in other ways). Afterwards you sojourned for several years with the people of Midian; then you came up to the measure,",39,20,إِذْ تَمْشِىٓ أُخْتُكَ فَتَقُولُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ مَن يَكْفُلُهُۥ فَرَجَعْنَٰكَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمِّكَ كَىْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا وَلَا تَحْزَنَ وَقَتَلْتَ نَفْسًا فَنَجَّيْنَٰكَ مِنَ ٱلْغَمِّ وَفَتَنَّٰكَ فُتُونًا فَلَبِثْتَ سِنِينَ فِىٓ أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَىٰ قَدَرٍ يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"When your sister went out following the chest wherever it went, and she said to those who took it: Shall I show you someone who will take care of him, nurse him and rear him. I then favoured you by returning you to your mother so that she could rejoice by your return to her and not grieve over you. Then You killed the copt whom you punched, but We favoured you by saving you from difficulty. And we helped you time after time from every test that you faced. You then left and stayed among the people of Madyan for years, then you came at the time that was specified for you to come to be spoken to O Moses."
And I chose you for Myself.,40,20,وَٱصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى,I have selected you as My messenger to convey to people the revelation I sent to you.
"Go with My signs, you and your brother, and do not be lax in remembering Me.",41,20,ٱذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَأَخُوكَ بِـَٔايَٰتِى وَلَا تَنِيَا فِى ذِكْرِى,"Go, you - O Moses - and your brother Aaron, with My signs indicating Allah’s Power and Oneness, and do not slacken in calling towards Me and in remembering Me."
Then go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious.,42,20,ٱذْهَبَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُۥ طَغَىٰ,"Go to Pharaoh, for he has overstepped the bounds in disbelief and rebellion against Allah."
"Speak to him gently. He may possibly take heed or may come to have fear.""",43,20,فَقُولَا لَهُۥ قَوْلًا لَّيِّنًا لَّعَلَّهُۥ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَىٰ,"Speak to him gently without harshness, in the hope that he may take heed, fear Allah and repent."
"They said: ""O our Lord, we are really frightened lest he behave insolently with us or become violent.""",44,20,قَالَا رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَا نَخَافُ أَن يَفْرُطَ عَلَيْنَآ أَوْ أَن يَطْغَىٰ,"Moses and Aaron peace be upon them) said: We fear that he will quickly punish us before we can deliver Your message to him, or that he will exceed the limit in oppressing us by killing us or otherwise."
"(The Lord) said: ""Be not afraid. I am verily with you, and I hear and see.",45,20,قَالَ لَا تَخَافَآ إِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَىٰ,"Allah said to them: Do not be afraid, I am with you both with My help and support. I hear and see everything that occurs between you and him."
"So go to him and say: 'The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord. So let the children of Israel come with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a token from your Lord. Peace on him who follows the way of guidance.",46,20,فَأْتِيَاهُ فَقُولَآ إِنَّا رَسُولَا رَبِّكَ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَلَا تُعَذِّبْهُمْ قَدْ جِئْنَٰكَ بِـَٔايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَٱلسَّلَٰمُ عَلَىٰ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلْهُدَىٰٓ,So go to him and tell him: We are the messengers of your Lord - O Pharaoh - so send the Israelites with us and do not punish them by killing their sons and letting their women live. We have brought to you a sign from your Lord proving our truthfulness. Safety from Allah’s punishment is for those who have faith and follow Allah’s guidance.
It has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies and turns away.,47,20,إِنَّا قَدْ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْنَآ أَنَّ ٱلْعَذَابَ عَلَىٰ مَن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,Allah has revealed to us that punishment in this world and the afterlife falls on whoever rejects the signs of Allah and turns his back on what the messengers brought.
"He asked: ""Who then is that Lord of yours, O Moses?""",48,20,قَالَ فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"Pharaoh said, in denial of what they brought: Who then is your Lord, whom you claim has sent you to me, O Moses?"
"(Moses) said: ""Our Lord is He who gave everything its natural form and directed it.""",49,20,قَالَ رَبُّنَا ٱلَّذِىٓ أَعْطَىٰ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلْقَهُۥ ثُمَّ هَدَىٰ,"Moses said: Our Lord is the One Who gave everything the shape and form suitable for it, and then He guided all created things to what they were created for."
"(The Pharaoh) said: ""And what about the former generations?""",50,20,قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ ٱلْقُرُونِ ٱلْأُولَىٰ,Pharaoh said: What about the previous communities who had disbelieved?
"(Moses) replied: ""Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.""",51,20,قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّى فِى كِتَٰبٍ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّى وَلَا يَنسَى,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to Pharaoh: The knowledge of what those communities did is with my Lord, recorded in the Preserved Tablet. My Lord does not err in His Knowledge of things nor does He forget anything."
"It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation",52,20,ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ مَهْدًا وَسَلَكَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلًا وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِۦٓ أَزْوَٰجًا مِّن نَّبَاتٍ شَتَّىٰ,My Lord is the One who made the earth spread out for you to live on and made for you on it pathways to travel on. He sent down rain water from the sky and with that water He brings forth every kind of plant.
To eat and feed your cattle. Surely there are signs in these for those who are wise.,53,20,كُلُوا۟ وَٱرْعَوْا۟ أَنْعَٰمَكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلنُّهَىٰ,"Eat - O people - of the pure things that I have brought forth for you, and graze your cattle. In the favours that are mentioned there are signs of Allah’s Power and Oneness for people of understanding."
We created you from the earth and will revert you back to it; and raise you up from it a second time.,54,20,مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ,"From the soil of the earth I created your father, Adam (peace be upon him), into it I shall return you by your being buried therein when you pass away, and from it I shall take you out you a second time when you will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment."
"So We showed him all Our signs, but he denied them and refused,",55,20,وَلَقَدْ أَرَيْنَٰهُ ءَايَٰتِنَا كُلَّهَا فَكَذَّبَ وَأَبَىٰ,I showed Pharaoh all of My nine signs. He saw them all but denied them and refused to respond by having faith in Allah.
"And said: ""Have you come to us, O Moses, to drive us out of our land with your witchery?",56,20,قَالَ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتُخْرِجَنَا مِنْ أَرْضِنَا بِسِحْرِكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"Pharaoh said: Have you come to remove us from Egypt with the magic that you brought, O Moses, so that you can gain control over it?"
"We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep.""",57,20,فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّكَ بِسِحْرٍ مِّثْلِهِۦ فَٱجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِدًا لَّا نُخْلِفُهُۥ نَحْنُ وَلَآ أَنتَ مَكَانًا سُوًى,"We will certainly bring to, O Moses, magic similar to yours, so make an appointment between you and us at a specified time and place, which neither of us will fail to keep, and let the place be a central and even place to both groups."
"Said (Moses): ""Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight.""",58,20,قَالَ مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ ٱلزِّينَةِ وَأَن يُحْشَرَ ٱلنَّاسُ ضُحًى,Moses (peace be upon him) said to Pharaoh: The appointment between you and us will be on the day of the festival when people will gather to celebrate the festival in the morning.
"After this the Pharaoh withdrew and settled his stratagem, then came back.",59,20,فَتَوَلَّىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فَجَمَعَ كَيْدَهُۥ ثُمَّ أَتَىٰ,Pharaoh went back and gathered his plots and tricks. Then he came at the specified time and place for the contest.
"Moses said to them: ""Woe betide you. Do not fabricate a lie against God, or He will destroy you with some affliction. For he who fabricates lies is doomed to failure.""",60,20,قَالَ لَهُم مُّوسَىٰ وَيْلَكُمْ لَا تَفْتَرُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ,"Moses said advising Pharaoh’s magicians: Beware, do not invent lies against Allah through the magic by means of which you deceive people, or He will eliminate you with a punishment from Him. Whoever invents lies against Allah is a loser."
"So they discussed their strategy among themselves and conferred privately,",61,20,فَتَنَٰزَعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ وَأَسَرُّوا۟ ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ,The magicians argued among themselves when they heard what Moses (peace be upon him) had to say and they conferred secretly.
"(And) said: ""These two are surely magicians. They want to deprive you of your land with their magic, and eradicate your distinct way (of life).",62,20,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَٰنِ لَسَٰحِرَٰنِ يُرِيدَانِ أَن يُخْرِجَاكُم مِّنْ أَرْضِكُم بِسِحْرِهِمَا وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ ٱلْمُثْلَىٰ,The magicians said to one another secretly: Moses and Aaron are both magicians. Their intention is to drive you out of Egypt with the magic that they brought and put an end to your superior way of life and sublime religion.
"So prepare your strategy and come forward. He alone shall win today who is superior.""",63,20,فَأَجْمِعُوا۟ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ٱئْتُوا۟ صَفًّا وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مَنِ ٱسْتَعْلَىٰ,So make a firm decision and do not differ therein. Then go forward in rows and throw down what you have all at once. Whoever defeats his opponent today has attained his objective.
"They said: ""Either you cast (your spell), O Moses, or we shall cast it first.""",64,20,قَالُوا۟ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىٰ,"The magicians said to Moses (peace be upon him): O Moses, you have one of two options: Either you will be the first to throw down the magic you have, or we will be the first to do so."
"Moses said: ""No. You cast it first"" Then it seemed to Moses that by their magic their cords and rods were flying;",65,20,قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُوا۟ فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَىٰ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said: Rather, you throw what you have first. So they threw what they had and suddenly their ropes and sticks that they had thrown seemed to Moses, because of their magic, to be snakes moving quickly."
And Moses felt afraid within himself.,66,20,فَأَوْجَسَ فِى نَفْسِهِۦ خِيفَةً مُّوسَىٰ,Moses was inwardly alarmed thinking that they would come for him.
"We said to him: ""Fear not. You will certainly be victorious.",67,20,قُلْنَا لَا تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ,Allah said to Moses (peace be upon him) reassuring him: Do not be afraid of what they seem to you. You - O Moses - have the upper hand over them and you will be victorious.
"Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come.""",68,20,وَأَلْقِ مَا فِى يَمِينِكَ تَلْقَفْ مَا صَنَعُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا صَنَعُوا۟ كَيْدُ سَٰحِرٍ وَلَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّاحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَىٰ,"Throw down the stick that is in your right hand: it will turn into a snake and swallow up the magic they have produced. They have only produced a magic trick, and a magician will not achieve his objective, wherever he may be."
"The magicians, (seeing the miracle), fell down in prostration, saying: ""We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.""",69,20,فَأُلْقِىَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سُجَّدًا قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِرَبِّ هَٰرُونَ وَمُوسَىٰ,"So Moses threw down his stick and it turned into a snake and swallowed up what the magicians had produced. The magicians then all prostrated to Allah once they came to know that what Moses had was not magic, but it was from Allah and they said: We have faith in the Lord of Moses and Aaron, the Lord of all created things."
"(The Pharaoh) said: ""You have come to believe without my dispensation. Surely he is your chief who taught you magic. I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of date-palm trees. You will come to know whose punishment is harder and protracted.""",70,20,قَالَ ءَامَنتُمْ لَهُۥ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلَأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُم مِّنْ خِلَٰفٍ وَلَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِى جُذُوعِ ٱلنَّخْلِ وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ أَيُّنَآ أَشَدُّ عَذَابًا وَأَبْقَىٰ,"Pharaoh said in rejection of the faith of the magicians and as threat to them:   Have you believed in Moses before I have given you permission to do so? Moses must be your master - O magicians - who taught you magic. I shall certainly cut off from each one of you one hand and foot from opposite sides, then I will crucify your bodies on the trunks of palm trees until you die. You will become a lesson for others and you will know then which of us has the fiercer and more lasting punishment: I or the Lord of Moses?"
"They replied: ""We cannot choose you in the face of the clear testimony we have received, and over Him who created us. So do what you are determined to do. All that you would do will only be confined to our life on earth.",71,20,قَالُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْثِرَكَ عَلَىٰ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَٱلَّذِى فَطَرَنَا فَٱقْضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍ إِنَّمَا تَقْضِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَآ,"The magicians said to Pharaoh: We shall never prefer following you - O Pharaoh - to following the clear signs that have come to us. We will never prefer you to Allah Who created us. So do whatever you want to us: you only have power over us in this present transient life, and your power will soon vanish."
"We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding.""",72,20,إِنَّآ ءَامَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغْفِرَ لَنَا خَطَٰيَٰنَا وَمَآ أَكْرَهْتَنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلسِّحْرِ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰٓ,"We believe in our Lord, with the hope that He will erase from us our past sins of disbelief and other sins, and that He will erase from us the sin of magic that you forced us to learn, practice and challenge Moses with. Allah has a better reward than what you promise us and His punishment is more lasting than the punishment you threaten us with."
"Surely for him who comes before his Lord a sinner shall be Hell, where he will neither die nor live.",73,20,إِنَّهُۥ مَن يَأْتِ رَبَّهُۥ مُجْرِمًا فَإِنَّ لَهُۥ جَهَنَّمَ لَا يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَىٰ,"The matter and gist is that those who come to their Lord on the Day of Judgment as disbelievers will enter the fire to remain there forever. Therein they will not die and be relieved of its torment, nor will they live a pleasant life."
"But whoever comes before Him a believer having done good deeds, will be raised to higher stations --",74,20,وَمَن يَأْتِهِۦ مُؤْمِنًا قَدْ عَمِلَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلدَّرَجَٰتُ ٱلْعُلَىٰ,"Those who come to their Sustainer on the Day of Judgement as believers who had done righteous actions, then such people will be rewarded with lofty abodes and high ranks in Paradise."
"Gardens of Eden with rippling streams, where he will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who achieve integrity.",75,20,جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ مَن تَزَكَّىٰ,"Those ranks are Gardens of Eternity with streams flowing under their palaces, and there they will stay there forever. That is the reward of those who purify themselves from disbelief and sins."
"We commanded Moses: ""Journey by night with Our creatures, and strike a dry path for them through the sea. Do not fear being overtaken, nor have dread of any thing.""",76,20,وَلَقَدْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِى فَٱضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقًا فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ يَبَسًا لَّا تَخَٰفُ دَرَكًا وَلَا تَخْشَىٰ,"And I revealed to Moses to take My servants by night from Egypt so that nobody notices them, and make for them a dry path in the sea after striking the sea with the staff, safely without fearing Pharaoh and his people catching up with you nor being scared of drowning in the sea."
"Then the Pharaoh followed them with his army, but the sea overpowered and engulfed them.",77,20,فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ بِجُنُودِهِۦ فَغَشِيَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْيَمِّ مَا غَشِيَهُمْ,"Then Pharoah, accompanied by his armies, followed them. Then he and his armies were engulfed by part of the sea, the reality of which only Allah knows. They all drowned and perished, whilst Moses and those with him were saved."
"The Pharaoh had led his people astray, and did not rightly guide them.",78,20,وَأَضَلَّ فِرْعَوْنُ قَوْمَهُۥ وَمَا هَدَىٰ,"And Pharaoh misguided his people by making disbelief appear good to them and by deceiving them through falsehood, and he did not direct them towards the path of guidance."
"O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,",79,20,يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ قَدْ أَنجَيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ عَدُوِّكُمْ وَوَٰعَدْنَٰكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلْأَيْمَنَ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ,"And I said to the Children of Israel after saving them from Pharoah and his armies: “O Children of Israel, I saved you from your enemy, and I promised you that I will speak to Moses to the right of the valley by Mount Tur, and I sent down to you whilst you were wandering food you can eat which is sweet and resembles gum, and birds which resemble quails.”"
"(And said): ""Eat of the good things We have given you for food, and do not exceed the bounds (of law) in this, or My wrath will surely fall upon you; and he who incurs My wrath will fall into the abyss.",80,20,كُلُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٰكُمْ وَلَا تَطْغَوْا۟ فِيهِ فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِى وَمَن يَحْلِلْ عَلَيْهِ غَضَبِى فَقَدْ هَوَىٰ,"Eat the wholesome lawful foods I have provided you and do not go beyond what I have made lawful to you, so you consume what I have made forbidden for you, otherwise My anger will fall on you. Whoever My anger falls upon will be destroyed and fall into Hell."
"Yet I am gracious to him who repents and believes, and does the right, and follows the straight path.",81,20,وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا ثُمَّ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,"And I am extremely forgiving and pardoning to one who repents to Me, does good deeds and is then firm on the truth."
"What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people?""",82,20,وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَوْمِكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ,"And what has made you rush from your people, O Moses, leaving them behind?”"
"He said: ""They are right behind me. I have hastened to You, O Lord, so that You may be pleased.""",83,20,قَالَ هُمْ أُو۟لَآءِ عَلَىٰٓ أَثَرِى وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said: “Here they are behind me. They shall catch up with me. I preceded my people in coming to You, so that you become pleased with me for coming towards You quickly”."
"He said: ""We have put your people on trial in your absence; and Sameri has led them astray.""",84,20,قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِنۢ بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ ٱلسَّامِرِىُّ,Allah said: “I have tested your people whom you left behind through worship of the calf. Samiri called them to worshipping it and he has misguided them through this”.
"So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. ""O my people,"" he said, ""did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?""",85,20,فَرَجَعَ مُوسَىٰٓ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ غَضْبَٰنَ أَسِفًا قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْدًا حَسَنًا أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْعَهْدُ أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُم مَّوْعِدِى,"Moses returned to his people, angered by their worship of the calf and grieving over them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: “My people, did Allah not make you a good promise that He will send the Torah to you and enter you into paradise? Had a long time passed upon you that you forgot? Or did you intend through this action of yours that your Lord’s anger should descend upon you and His punishment befall you, and this is why you broke your promise to me to stay firm on obedience until I return to you?”"
"They said: ""We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri.",86,20,قَالُوا۟ مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا وَلَٰكِنَّا حُمِّلْنَآ أَوْزَارًا مِّن زِينَةِ ٱلْقَوْمِ فَقَذَفْنَٰهَا فَكَذَٰلِكَ أَلْقَى ٱلسَّامِرِىُّ,"Moses’ people said: “We did not break your promise, O Moses, by our own choice, but rather by compulsion. We carried large weights of the jewellery of Pharaoh’s people and we threw them into a ditch to get rid of them. But as we threw them into the ditch, Samiri threw into it some dust he had from the hoof of the horse of Gabriel (peace be upon him)”."
"Then he produced the image of a calf which mooed like a cow. And they said: 'This is your god and the god of Moses (whom) he has neglected.""",87,20,فَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُۥ خُوَارٌ فَقَالُوا۟ هَٰذَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُ مُوسَىٰ فَنَسِىَ,"So Samiri took out from this jewellery of the Israelites a lifeless body of a calf, which made a noise like that of a cow. Those amongst them who had been tempted by Samiri’s action said: “This is your god and the god of Moses which he forgot and left here”."
"Did they not see that it did not give them any answer, nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain?",88,20,أَفَلَا يَرَوْنَ أَلَّا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا,"Do these people who were tempted by the calf and then worshipped it not see that the calf does not speak or respond to them, nor does it have the ability to remove harm from them or others or bring benefit for itself or others?"
"Aaron had indeed told them earlier: ""O my people, you are being only misled with this. Surely your Lord is Ar-Rahman. So follow me and obey my command.""",89,20,وَلَقَدْ قَالَ لَهُمْ هَٰرُونُ مِن قَبْلُ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا فُتِنتُم بِهِۦ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ فَٱتَّبِعُونِى وَأَطِيعُوٓا۟ أَمْرِى,"Aaron had said to them before Moses returned to them: “The making of the calf from gold and its mooing are only to test you, to distinguish the believer from the disbeliever. And your Lord, O people, is Allah, so follow me by worshipping Him alone and obey my command to leave worshipping others besides Him”."
"They said ""So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up, and we will remain devoted to it.""",90,20,قَالُوا۟ لَن نَّبْرَحَ عَلَيْهِ عَٰكِفِينَ حَتَّىٰ يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ,Those who had been tempted through worship of the calf said: “We will continue worshipping it until Moses returns to us”.
"But (Moses) said: ""O Aaron, when you saw that they had gone astray, what hindered you",91,20,قَالَ يَٰهَٰرُونُ مَا مَنَعَكَ إِذْ رَأَيْتَهُمْ ضَلُّوٓا۟,"Moses said to his brother Aaron: “What was it that stopped you, when you saw them go astray by worshipping the calf besides Allah,"
"From coming after me? Did you not disobey my command?"" (And Moses pulled him by the hair).",92,20,أَلَّا تَتَّبِعَنِ أَفَعَصَيْتَ أَمْرِى,from leaving them and joining me? Did you disobey my order to you when I made you my deputy over them?”
"""O son of my mother,"" (Aaron cried), do not pull me by my beard or my hair! I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel, and did not pay heed to your command.""",93,20,قَالَ يَبْنَؤُمَّ لَا تَأْخُذْ بِلِحْيَتِى وَلَا بِرَأْسِىٓ إِنِّى خَشِيتُ أَن تَقُولَ فَرَّقْتَ بَيْنَ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَلَمْ تَرْقُبْ قَوْلِى,"When Moses took his brother by his beard and head, dragging him and scolding him for what he did, Aaron said to him, seeking his compassion: “Do not hold my beard and the hair on my head, for I have a reason for staying with them. I feared if I leave them alone they will disperse, then you will say I split them apart and that I did not maintain your bequest regarding them”."
"Moses asked: ""O Sameri, what was the matter?""",94,20,قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكَ يَٰسَٰمِرِىُّ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to Samiri: “What is your matter, O Samiri? What made you do what you did?”"
"He said: ""I saw what they did not see. I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger's tracks and threw it in, for the idea seemed attractive to me.""",95,20,قَالَ بَصُرْتُ بِمَا لَمْ يَبْصُرُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَقَبَضْتُ قَبْضَةً مِّنْ أَثَرِ ٱلرَّسُولِ فَنَبَذْتُهَا وَكَذَٰلِكَ سَوَّلَتْ لِى نَفْسِى,"Samiri said to Moses (peace be upon him): “I saw what they did not see: I saw Gabriel on a horse, so I took a handful of soil from the footsteps of his horse and threw it on melted jewellery which was moulded into the form of a calf. From this, the body of a calf with a mooing sound was formed. And this is how my soul made what I did appealing to me”."
"(Moses) said: ""Go hence! All your life you are (cursed) to say: 'Do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape. Look at your god to whom you are so attached: We shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea.",96,20,قَالَ فَٱذْهَبْ فَإِنَّ لَكَ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ أَن تَقُولَ لَا مِسَاسَ وَإِنَّ لَكَ مَوْعِدًا لَّن تُخْلَفَهُۥ وَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰٓ إِلَٰهِكَ ٱلَّذِى ظَلْتَ عَلَيْهِ عَاكِفًا لَّنُحَرِّقَنَّهُۥ ثُمَّ لَنَنسِفَنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ نَسْفًا,"Moses (peace be upon him) said to Samiri: “Go, for it is written for you that you will say as long as you live: ‘I am not to touch or be touched’. You will live as an outcast, and you have a promised time on the Day of Judgment in which you will be reckoned and punished. Allah will never break this promise with you. And look towards your calf which you had made your god and which you continued to worship besides Allah. We shall burn it in a fire until it melts, then we shall scatter it into the sea until no trace of it remains."
"Your god is only God. There is no other god but He. His knowledge extends over everything.""",97,20,إِنَّمَآ إِلَٰهُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَسِعَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًا,"Your true god, O people, is Allah only, besides whom there is no true god. He has encompassed everything in His knowledge; only He knows everything and nothing escapes His awareness”."
"Thus do We narrate some account to you of what has gone before, and We have truly given you a Reminder of Our own.",98,20,كَذَٰلِكَ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ مَا قَدْ سَبَقَ وَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَٰكَ مِن لَّدُنَّا ذِكْرًا,"Just as I related to you, O Messenger, the story of Moses, Pharaoh and their people, I relate to you the incidents of the prophets and nations before you, so that they are a solace for you. And I have given you from Myself a Qur’ān through which those who seek reminders are reminded."
"Whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the Day of Judgement,",99,20,مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ فَإِنَّهُۥ يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وِزْرًا,Whoever turns away from this Qur’ān which has been revealed to you and does not believe in it and act accordingly will come on the Day of Judgment carrying great sin and deserving a painful punishment.
And will live for ever under it. How evil the burden they will carry on the Day of Doom!,100,20,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهِ وَسَآءَ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ حِمْلًا,Staying in this punishment forever. How awful a burden they will be carrying on the day of judgment.
"The day the trumpet blast is sounded We shall raise the sinners blind,",101,20,يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى ٱلصُّورِ وَنَحْشُرُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمَئِذٍ زُرْقًا,"The day when the angel will blow in the trumpet a second time for the resurrection, and I shall gather the disbelievers on this day, blue-eyed, due to their complexion and eyes changing out of the severe horrors of the afterlife they will face."
"Whispering to one another: ""You have tarried but ten days.""",102,20,يَتَخَٰفَتُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا عَشْرًا,They will talk to one another quietly saying: “You did not stay in the Transitory Stage after death except ten nights”.
"We know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say: ""You did not tarry more than a day.""",103,20,نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ إِذْ يَقُولُ أَمْثَلُهُمْ طَرِيقَةً إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا يَوْمًا,"I know best what they secretly say amongst themselves, with none of it escaping Me, when the most intelligent of them says: “You did not stay in the Transitory Stage except for one day, no more”."
"They will ask you about the mountains. Tell them: ""My Lord will uproot them from the base,",104,20,وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفًا,"They ask you, O Messenger, regarding the condition of the mountains on the Day of Judgment. Say to them: My Lord will pull out the mountains from their roots and scatter them, then they will become dust."
"And turn them into a level plain,",105,20,فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعًا صَفْصَفًا,"He will then leave the earth which used to carry them as flat, with no buildings or vegetation on it."
Over which you will see no curves or elevations.,106,20,لَّا تَرَىٰ فِيهَا عِوَجًا وَلَآ أَمْتًا,"O onlooker, you will not see on the earth, due to it being totally flat, any curve, elevation or dip."
"That day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding; and their voices will be hushed before Ar-Rahman, and you will not hear a sound but faint shuffling.",107,20,يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلدَّاعِىَ لَا عِوَجَ لَهُۥ وَخَشَعَتِ ٱلْأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ فَلَا تَسْمَعُ إِلَّا هَمْسًا,"On that day, people will follow the sound of the caller towards the gathering place. There will be nothing to divert them from following it. The voices will silence for the Merciful, out of fear, so you will not hear on this day except whispering."
On that day no intercession will matter other than his whom Ar-Rahman grants permission and accepts.,108,20,يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِىَ لَهُۥ قَوْلًا,"On this great day, no intercession from any intercessor will benefit, except one whom Allah allows to intercede and Allah is pleased with what he says in intercession."
"He knows what is before them and hidden from them, but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge.",109,20,يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِۦ عِلْمًا,Allah knows what people will face in the final hour and He knows what they will have left behind in their worldly life. All the servants together cannot encompass the knowledge of Allah’s being and His qualities.
"All heads will be bowed before the Living, the Eternal; and whosoever bears a load of iniquity will be full of despair.",110,20,وَعَنَتِ ٱلْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ ٱلْقَيُّومِ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْمًا,"The faces of the servants will humble and surrender before the Eternal One who does not die and who takes care of the affairs of His servants by managing and administering them. And the one Who carried sin has lost, due to his taking himself to places of destruction."
"But he who has done good things and believes, will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived.",111,20,وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَا يَخَافُ ظُلْمًا وَلَا هَضْمًا,"Whoever does good deeds whilst believing in Allah and His messengers will attain his full reward, and will neither fear injustice by being punished for a sin he did not commit nor a decrease in the reward of his good deeds."
"That is why We have sent it down as an eloquent Qur'an, and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed, or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate.",112,20,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ قُرْءَانًا عَرَبِيًّا وَصَرَّفْنَا فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْوَعِيدِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ أَوْ يُحْدِثُ لَهُمْ ذِكْرًا,"I have revealed the Qur’ān in clear Arabic just as I revealed the stories of the previous prophets, and I have explained in it different warnings of threat and fear, in the hope they will fear Allah or that the admonition of the Qur’ān will cause them to reflect."
"Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: ""O Lord, give me greater knowledge.""",113,20,فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلَا تَعْجَلْ بِٱلْقُرْءَانِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُقْضَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُۥ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْمًا,"Allah is High above and Exalted from what the idolaters describe Him with of deficiencies and from what they attribute as partners to Him. He is the Majestic King, to whom belongs the kingdom of everything, and who is the Truth and speaks the truth. Do not hasten, O Messenger, in reciting the Qur’ān with Gabriel before it is completely conveyed to you, and say: O Lord, increase me in knowledge, on top of what You have already taught me."
"We had commanded Adam before, but he disregarded it: We found him lacking in resolution.",114,20,وَلَقَدْ عَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ ءَادَمَ مِن قَبْلُ فَنَسِىَ وَلَمْ نَجِدْ لَهُۥ عَزْمًا,"And I enjoined on Adam beforehand not to eat of the tree, and I forbade him from this and explained to him its consequences. But he forgot the instruction, ate of the tree and was unable to resist it. And I did not see in him resolve to observe what I enjoined."
"When We said to the angels: ''Bow before Adam,'' they all bowed but Iblis, who refused.",115,20,وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِءَادَمَ فَسَجَدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ,"And remember, O Messenger, when I said to the angels: “Prostrate to Adam as a greeting”. All of them prostrated besides Iblis, who was with them but not from them. He refused to prostrate out of arrogance."
"So We said; ""O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief.",116,20,فَقُلْنَا يَٰٓـَٔادَمُ إِنَّ هَٰذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ فَلَا يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَىٰٓ,"So I said: “O Adam, Iblis is your enemy and your wife’s enemy, so let him not take you and your wife out of paradise, by obeying him in what he whispers, in which case you will bear difficulties and hardship."
"Verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there,",117,20,إِنَّ لَكَ أَلَّا تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلَا تَعْرَىٰ,"It is Allah’s responsibility towards you that He will feed you, so you will not get hungry, and to clothe you, so you will not be naked."
"Nor thirst nor exposure to the sun.""",118,20,وَأَنَّكَ لَا تَظْمَؤُا۟ فِيهَا وَلَا تَضْحَىٰ,"And to give you water so that you do not get thirsty, and to shade you so that the heat of the sun does not affect you”."
"But then Satan tempted him by saying: ""O Adam, should I show you the tree of immortality, and a kingdom that will never know any wane?""",119,20,فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ قَالَ يَٰٓـَٔادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَىٰ شَجَرَةِ ٱلْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لَّا يَبْلَىٰ,"But the satan whispered to Adam saying: “Shall I show you a tree that whoever eats from it will never die, but in fact remain forever, and possess an everlasting kingdom that will never break or end?”"
"And both ate of (its fruit), and their hidden parts were exposed to one another, and they patched the leaves of the garden (to hide them). Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went astray.",120,20,فَأَكَلَا مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَٰتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَىٰٓ ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُۥ فَغَوَىٰ,"Then Adam and Eve ate of the tree they were forbidden to eat from, then their private areas became exposed to them after they were hidden, and they began to pluck the leaves of the trees of paradise and cover their private areas with them. Adam opposed the command of his Lord, as he did not comply with His order of refraining from eating of the tree, and so he trespassed the bounds towards that which was not allowed for him."
"Then his Lord chose him and relented towards him, and showed him the way;",121,20,ثُمَّ ٱجْتَبَٰهُ رَبُّهُۥ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَىٰ,"Then Allah chose him, accepted his repentance and enabled him to be guided."
"(And) said: ""Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other. Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable.",122,20,قَالَ ٱهْبِطَا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًۢا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّى هُدًى فَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هُدَاىَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ,"Allah said to Adam and Eve: “Both of you and Iblis, descend from paradise, because he is your enemy and you are his enemies. If there comes to you from Me an explanation of My path, then whoever amongst you follows the explanation of my path, acts accordingly and does not divert from it, he will not go astray from the truth nor will he be misfortunate in the afterlife through punishment, but rather Allah will enter him into paradise."
"But he who fails to heed My warning will have his means restricted; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind.""",123,20,وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِى فَإِنَّ لَهُۥ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَعْمَىٰ,"And whoever turns away from My reminder and does not accept it or respond to it shall have a constricted and miserable life in this world and in the Transitory Stage, and I shall lead him towards the gathering place on the Day of Judgment without eyesight and proof."
"He will ask: ""O Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see?""",124,20,قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِىٓ أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا,"This person will say: “O Lord, why did you raise me blind today when I could see in the world?”"
"(God) will say: ""Because Our signs came to you, but you disregarded them. So shall We disregard you this day.""",125,20,قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ ءَايَٰتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ,"Allah said in refutation of him: “This is like what you did in the world, because My signs came to you but you turned away from them and left them. Likewise, you will be left today in punishment”."
And that is how We requite him who is extravagant and does not believe the signs of his Lord; and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and persistent.,126,20,وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى مَنْ أَسْرَفَ وَلَمْ يُؤْمِنۢ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِۦ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَشَدُّ وَأَبْقَىٰٓ,"And this is the kind of reward I give to the one engrossed in unlawful desires and who turns away from believing in the clear proofs from his Lord. And the punishment of Allah in the Hearafter is even more horrible, severe, and lasting, than the life they will have in the world and in the transition."
"Did they not learn from the many generations that We destroyed before them, whose habitations they now frequent? Verily there are signs in this for men of understanding.",127,20,أَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَٰكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلنُّهَىٰ,Is it not clear to the idolaters how many nations I destroyed before them? They walk in the homes of these destroyed nations and see the effects of what befell them. In the destruction and ruination which befell these many nations are lessons for people of intelligence.
"If the decree (of respite) had not been pronounced by your Lord, (the inevitable judgement would have ensued); but a term is fixed (for everything).",128,20,وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَكَانَ لِزَامًا وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى,"O Messenger, had a word not preceded from your Lord that He will not punish anyone before establishing the proof against him, and had there not been a time which is fixed with Him, the punishment would have come to them quickly, due to their deserving it."
"So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun, and honour Him in the watches of the night, and then at the two ends of day, that you may find acceptance.",129,20,فَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا وَمِنْ ءَانَآئِ ٱلَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْ وَأَطْرَافَ ٱلنَّهَارِ لَعَلَّكَ تَرْضَىٰ,"So be patient, O Messenger, on the false things those who disbelieve in you say about you. Glorify and praise your Lord in the Fajr prayer before sunrise; in the Asr prayer before sunset; in the hours of night in the Maghrib and Isha prayers; and in the Zuhr prayer just after the zenith, which is the end of the first part of the day and the beginning of the second part; in the hope of attaining reward with Allah which you will be pleased with."
Do not covet what We have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them. The means your Lord has given you are better far and more enduring.,130,20,وَلَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِۦٓ أَزْوَٰجًا مِّنْهُمْ زَهْرَةَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ,"And do not desire the types of enjoyment I have given to different groups of the disbelievers, the glitter of the worldly life which they enjoy so that I may test them. What I have given them of this will disappear, and the reward of your Lord which He has promised you and which will make you pleased is better and more lasting."
"Enjoin on your people service to God, and be yourself constant in it. We do not ask you to provide: It is We who provide for you. The reward is for piety and fear of God.",131,20,وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَٱصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا لَا نَسْـَٔلُكَ رِزْقًا نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ وَٱلْعَٰقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ,"And order your family, O Messenger, to perform prayer, and you also remain constant in its performance. I do not ask you for your own sustenance or that of others; I will take care of your sustenance. The praiseworthy outcome in this world and the afterlife is for the pious who fear Allah, carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions."
"Yet they say: ""Why does he not bring a sign from his Lord?"" Have not clear proofs come to them in what is contained in the earlier Books?",132,20,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا يَأْتِينَا بِـَٔايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦٓ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِم بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى ٱلصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَىٰ,These disbelievers who reject the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Why does Muhammad not bring us a sign from his Lord which proves his truthfulness and that he is a Messenger?” Has the Qur’ān which confirms the previous divine books not come to these rejecters?
"If We had destroyed them by some calamity sooner than this, they would have surely said: ""O Lord, if You had sent to us a messenger we would have followed Your command before being humbled and disgraced.""",133,20,وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَٰهُم بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِۦ لَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا لَوْلَآ أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولًا فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَٰتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ,"And if I were to destroy these deniers of the Prophet (peace be upon him) by sending punishment on them due to their disbelief and obstinacy, before sending a messenger to them and revealing a book to them, they would say on the Day of Judgment, as an excuse for their disbelief: “O Lord, if only You had sent a messenger to us in the world, so that we could have believed in him and followed the verses that he brought, before disgrace and shame befell us through Your punishment”."
"Say: ""Each one awaits the consequence; so you wait. You will come to know soon who are the men of the straight path and who have come to guidance.",134,20,قُلْ كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ فَتَرَبَّصُوا۟ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلصِّرَٰطِ ٱلسَّوِىِّ وَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,"O Messenger, say to these deniers: “Each one of us and you awaits what Allah will carry out, so wait. You will most certainly come to know who are the people of the straight path and who are the guided: us or you?”"
"NEAR HAS COME the reckoning for men, but they turn away in remissness.",0,21,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَابُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"People’s being taken to account for their actions on the Day of Judgment has come close, but they are turning away from the afterlife in their unmindfulness, due to their being preoccupied with the world."
Never does a new reminder come to them from their Lord but they listen to it with dalliance.,1,21,مَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِم مُّحْدَثٍ إِلَّا ٱسْتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,"And no part of the Qur’ān which is newly revealed comes to them except that they listen to it without benefiting, but rather playful listening, without caring about its contents."
"Their minds are lost in frivolous pastimes; and the evil-doers discuss secretly: ""Is he not but only a man like you? Then why are you taken in by magic seeingly?""",2,21,لَاهِيَةً قُلُوبُهُمْ وَأَسَرُّوا۟ ٱلنَّجْوَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ هَلْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ أَفَتَأْتُونَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,"They listened to it whilst their hearts were unmindful of it. And those who are wrongdoers through disbelief hid their private talk when they said: “Is this one who claims to be a messenger but a man like you, without any distinction from you? What he has brought is magic. So will you follow him knowing that he is a man like you and what he has brought is magic?”"
"He said: ""My Lord knows whatever is spoken in the heavens and the earth. He hears all and knows everything.""",3,21,قَالَ رَبِّى يَعْلَمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"The Messenger (peace be upon him) said: “My Lord knows the speech you concealed, for He knows everything said by anyone in the heavens and the earth. He is Hearing of the sayings of His servants and Knowing of their actions, for which He shall reward them”."
"Yet they say: ""These are only confused dreams,"" or rather: ""He has invented them;"" or: ""He is only a poet. Let him therefore bring a miracle to us as the earlier (apostles) were sent with.""",4,21,بَلْ قَالُوٓا۟ أَضْغَٰثُ أَحْلَٰمٍۭ بَلِ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ بَلْ هُوَ شَاعِرٌ فَلْيَأْتِنَا بِـَٔايَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ,"But they were unsure of what Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought. At times they said: “Confused dreams which have no meaning”. And at times they said: “No, but in fact he made it up without any basis”. And sometimes they said: “He is a magician. If he is true in his claim, he should bring us a miracle like the former messengers, as they brought miracles like the staff of Moses and the camel of Salih”."
Not one habitation that We destroyed before them had believed. So how can they believe?,5,21,مَآ ءَامَنَتْ قَبْلَهُم مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَٰهَآ أَفَهُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Before these who are making a request, no town which ever made a request for divine signs. to be revealed and was then granted them as per their request ever believed. In fact, they denied them so I destroyed them. So will these people believe?"
"Never did We send a message before you but through a man, whom We inspired. If you do not know, then ask the keepers of the oracles of God.",6,21,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُّوحِىٓ إِلَيْهِمْ فَسْـَٔلُوٓا۟ أَهْلَ ٱلذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"And I did not send before you, O Messenger, except men amongst humans to whom I would send revelation. I did not send them as angels, so ask the People of the Book before you if you do not know this."
"We did not make their bodies immune to hunger, nor were they immortal.",7,21,وَمَا جَعَلْنَٰهُمْ جَسَدًا لَّا يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ خَٰلِدِينَ,"And I did not make the messengers I used to send as bodies which did not eat food. In fact, they used to eat as others eat, and they were not to remain in the world without dying."
"Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors.",8,21,ثُمَّ صَدَقْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْوَعْدَ فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُمْ وَمَن نَّشَآءُ وَأَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"Then I fulfilled what I promised My messengers, as I saved them and whomever I wanted amongst the believers from being destroyed. And I destroyed those who overstepped the limit through disbelief in Allah and committing disobedience."
We have sent down to you a Book which has a reminder for you. Do you not understand?,9,21,لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَٰبًا فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"I have revealed to you the Qur’ān in which lies your honour and pride, if you believe it and act according to its contents. Do you not understand this, so that you hasten towards believing it and practicing what it contains?"
"How many habitations that were sinful have We demolished utterly, and raised other people after them.",10,21,وَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَالِمَةً وَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْمًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"There are many towns which I destroyed due to their injustice through disbelief, and I created other people after them."
Whensoever they sensed Our punishment they fled from them.,11,21,فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّوا۟ بَأْسَنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ,"Then when those who were destroyed saw My destructive punishment, they began to run from their towns to flee destruction."
"""Do not flee; go back to your halls of pleasure and your habitations, so that you may be interrogated.""",12,21,لَا تَرْكُضُوا۟ وَٱرْجِعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَٰكِنِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْـَٔلُونَ,"They were being called mockingly: “Do not flee, but return to your enjoyment of luxuries which you were in and to your homes, so that you can be questioned somewhat regarding your worldly possessions”."
"""Woe, alas,"" they said, ""we were really sinful.""",13,21,قَالُوا۟ يَٰوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,These wrongdoers who confessed to their sins said: “Woe and destruction for us. We were wrongdoers due to our disbelief in Allah”.
And this remained their lament till We mowed them down and made them extinct.,14,21,فَمَا زَالَت تِّلْكَ دَعْوَىٰهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَعَلْنَٰهُمْ حَصِيدًا خَٰمِدِينَ,"So they continued confessing to their sins and praying for their own destruction until I made them like harvested crops, dead without any movement."
"We have not created the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, out of fun.",15,21,وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا لَٰعِبِينَ,"And I did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is in between as a plaything or in vain, but rather I created them to show My power."
"If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.",16,21,لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْوًا لَّٱتَّخَذْنَٰهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَٰعِلِينَ,"If I wanted to take a wife or child, I would have done so on My own part. But I did not do this as I am pure of this."
"In fact We strike the truth against the false, which shatters it, and it disappears. Woe to you for what you attribute (to Him)!",17,21,بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِٱلْحَقِّ عَلَى ٱلْبَٰطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُۥ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ ٱلْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ,"But rather, I throw the truth I reveal to My messengers upon the falsehood of the disbelievers, and it destroys it, and then their falsehood goes and finishes. And for you, O you who say Allah has taken a wife or son, is destruction, due to your describing Him with what is inappropriate for Him."
"Whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and those who are near Him do not disdain to worship Him or weary (of His service),",18,21,وَلَهُۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَنْ عِندَهُۥ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِۦ وَلَا يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ,And for Him alone is the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of earth. And the angels with Him neither scorn worshipping Him nor do they tire of it.
Nor cease to endeavour praising Him night and day.,19,21,يُسَبِّحُونَ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لَا يَفْتُرُونَ,They constantly glorify Him without tiring of it.
Or have they taken gods from the earth who can raise the dead?,20,21,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ ءَالِهَةً مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ هُمْ يُنشِرُونَ,"But the idolaters took gods besides Allah which cannot revive the dead, so how do they worship something unable to do this?"
"Had there been gods apart from God, both (the heavens and the earth) would have been despoiled. Much too glorious is God, the Lord of the mighty throne, for things they assert!",21,21,لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ ءَالِهَةٌ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا فَسُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"If there were numerous gods in the heavens and the earth, they would have been ruined, due to the gods disputing in the kingdom. But the reality is not like this. So Allah, Lord of the Throne, is pure of the lie the idolaters describe Him with, namely that He has partners."
"He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.",22,21,لَا يُسْـَٔلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَٔلُونَ,"And Allah is alone in His kingdom and decree. Nobody can ask Him what He has decreed and ordered, whilst He will ask His servants about their actions and will reward them accordingly."
"Have they taken gods besides God? Say: ""Then bring your proof. Here is the Book of those who are with me, and the Book of those who have gone before me."" But most men do not know the truth and turn away.",23,21,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةً قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ هَٰذَا ذِكْرُ مَن مَّعِىَ وَذِكْرُ مَن قَبْلِى بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ فَهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"But they took other gods besides Allah. Say, O Messenger, to these idolaters: “Bring your proof for their being worthy of worship. This book which has been revealed to me and the books revealed upon the messengers contain no proof for you”. But rather most of the idolaters only take support from ignorance and blind following, so they turn away from accepting the truth."
"We have not sent an apostle before you without instructing him that there is no god but I, so worship Me.",24,21,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِىٓ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنَا۠ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,"And I have not sent before you, O Messenger, any messenger except that I revealed to him that there is no true god except Me, so worship Me alone and do not associate any partner with Me."
"And yet they say: ""Ar-Rahman has begotten a son."" Too exalted is He! In fact, those (they call His sons) were His honoured votaries.",25,21,وَقَالُوا۟ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ,"The idolaters said: “Allah has taken the angels as daughters”. Pure and exalted is Allah from the lie they say. The angels are in fact the servants of Allah, honoured by Him and close to Him."
"They did not precede Him in their speech, and acted on His command.",26,21,لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُۥ بِٱلْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِۦ يَعْمَلُونَ,"They do not proceed before their Lord in any saying, so they do not speak until He orders them, and they act according to His command and do not oppose any command of His."
"He knows what was there before them and what came after them; and they did not intercede for any one but whom He willed, and they were filled with awe of Him.",27,21,يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِۦ مُشْفِقُونَ,"He knows their previous and latter actions. They do not ask to intercede except with His permission and on behalf of whom He approves intercession. And they are wary out of their fear of Him, so they do not oppose Him in any command or prohibition."
"If any one of them said: ""I am God besides Him,"" We should award him Hell; for this is how We requite the evil-doers.",28,21,وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّىٓ إِلَٰهٌ مِّن دُونِهِۦ فَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"And for argument’s sake, whoever amongst the angels were to say: “I am a god besides Allah”, I will punish him for what he says with Hellfire on the Day of Judgment, staying therein forever. And with this kind of punishment I punish those who are unjust by disbelieving and associating partners with Allah."
"Do not these unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass, then We split them and made every living thing from water? Will they not believe even then?",29,21,أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَٰهُمَا وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ حَىٍّ أَفَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Do those who disbelieved in Allah not know that the heavens and the earth were joint without any gap in between that rain should come down from it, then I split them apart? And I made every animal and plant from the water that comes down from the sky. Do they not consider this and believe in Allah alone?"
We placed stabilisers in the earth so that as it revolved with them you lived undisturbed; and We provided passageways between them so that men may find their way;,30,21,وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ رَوَٰسِىَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِهِمْ وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجًا سُبُلًا لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,"And I made firm mountains on earth, so that it does not shake those on its surface. I made in it wide paths and ways, so that they may find their way in their journeys towards their objectives."
And We made the sky a well-protected roof. Still they turn away from His signs!,31,21,وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ سَقْفًا مَّحْفُوظًا وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,"And I made the sky a roof protected from falling and without any pillar, and protected from stealing words. But the idolaters turn away and do not consider the signs in the sky, such as the sun and moon."
"It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, revolving on its orbit.",32,21,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ,"Allah alone is the One Who created the night for relaxation, created the day for earning one’s livelihood, created the sun as a sign of day, and the moon as a sign of night. The sun and moon both run in their specific orbits, without moving away or side-tracking."
"We have given no man everlastingness before you. So then if you die, will they live ever after?",33,21,وَمَا جَعَلْنَا لِبَشَرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ ٱلْخُلْدَ أَفَإِي۟ن مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلْخَٰلِدُونَ,"O Messenger, I have not given eternity in this life to any human before you. So if your life comes to an end in this life and you pass away, will they live forever after you? Never."
Every soul will know the taste of death. We tempt you with evil and with good as a trial; and to Us you will return.,34,21,كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِٱلشَّرِّ وَٱلْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ,"Every believing and disbelieving soul will taste death in the world. And I test you, O mankind, in the worldly life through duties, blessings and hardships, then after your death you shall be returned to Me alone and nobody else, then I shall reward you for your deeds."
"But when the unbelievers see you they make fun of you (and say): ""Is this the one who mentions your gods (deridingly)?"" Yet in Ar-Rahman they disbelieve!",35,21,وَإِذَا رَءَاكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلَّا هُزُوًا أَهَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى يَذْكُرُ ءَالِهَتَكُمْ وَهُم بِذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ هُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"O Messenger! When these idolaters see you they only mock you, trying to make you loathsome in the eyes of their followers by saying, “Is this the one who insults the idols that you worship?” whilst they themselves reject the Qur’ān that Allah revealed to them and the blessings He conferred upon them, together with mocking you. So they themselves are closer to shame, due to their accumulating every evil."
"Man is made of inordinate haste. We will show you Our signs, then you will not desire to hasten (the punishment).",36,21,خُلِقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ سَأُو۟رِيكُمْ ءَايَٰتِى فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونِ,"The human was created intrinsically to be hasty, and so he/she wants things to happen before their due time. The idolaters asking for the punishment is a result of that nature. O the ones seeking My punishment in haste! I shall show you exactly what you hastily seek, so there is no need to ask for it."
"Yet they say: ""When will the promised threat come to pass, if you speak the truth?""",37,21,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"And the disbelievers who reject resurrection say in their haste, “O Muslims! If indeed you are truthful in what you claim, when will this resurrection that you promise us with, happen?”"
"If only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs, nor help reach them!",38,21,لَوْ يَعْلَمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ حِينَ لَا يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَلَا عَن ظُهُورِهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"If these disbelieving rejecters of the resurrection were to know of the time when they will not be able to turn the hellfire away from their faces and backs, they would not be so hasty in seeking it. If only they were to know that there shall be no one to help relieve them of the punishment, and if only they were convinced of its reality, they would not be so hasty either."
"It will come upon them unawares confounding them, and they will not be able to keep it back, nor will they be given respite.",39,21,بَلْ تَأْتِيهِم بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ رَدَّهَا وَلَا هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"This fire that they shall be punished with will come upon them suddenly, without them anticipating it. They shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be given respite to repent and consequently be shown mercy."
Many apostles have been scoffed before you; but they who scoffed were themselves caught by what they had ridiculed.,40,21,وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُوا۟ مِنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"O Messenger! Even if your people mock you, you are not unique in that, because many messengers before you were also mocked at. After their messengers warned them of it, the very punishment the disbelievers made a mockery of engulfed them in this very world."
"Say: ""Who guards you from Ar-Rahman by night and by day?"" Yet from a mention of their Lord they turn away.",41,21,قُلْ مَن يَكْلَؤُكُم بِٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ مِنَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ بَلْ هُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these people who are hastily seeking the punishment: “Who will save you throughout the night and day from the punishment and destruction The Merciful intends to send upon you?” Rather, they are desisting from the admonition and proofs of their Lord; they foolishly and ignorantly do not ponder over any of it."
"Or do they have lords of their own besides Us who can defend them? But they are not able to help themselves, nor can they find protection against Us.",42,21,أَمْ لَهُمْ ءَالِهَةٌ تَمْنَعُهُم مِّن دُونِنَا لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَا هُم مِّنَّا يُصْحَبُونَ,"Do they have gods that will protect them from My punishment? They are not capable of helping even themselves by removing any harm or acquiring any benefit! Whoever cannot help himself, how can he help others? Nor will they be protected from My punishment."
"We allowed them and their fathers time to enjoy till the very end of their lives. Do they not see Us advancing into the land, reducing its frontiers? Would they still prevail?",43,21,بَلْ مَتَّعْنَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَءَابَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ طَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْعُمُرُ أَفَلَا يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِى ٱلْأَرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَآ أَفَهُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ,"Rather, I have supplied these disbelievers and their forefathers with all My blessings I conferred upon them, so that as time passes, they become blinded by them and stand firm upon their disbelief, gradually leading themselves into destruction. Do these people, deluded by My blessings and hastily seeking My punishment, not realise that I am narrowing the earth down from all sides, by My influence over the people and power over them? Do they not take lesson from that, lest the same does not happen to them? These people will not be victorious; they shall be beaten."
"Say: ""I am warning you by God's command."" But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.",44,21,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُنذِرُكُم بِٱلْوَحْىِ وَلَا يَسْمَعُ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا مَا يُنذَرُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: “O people! I only warn you of the punishment of Allah through divine revelation that my Lord reveals to me.” When those deaf to the truth are warned of the punishment of Allah, they do not listen to it with a heeding ear."
"Even if a whiff of the Lord's chastisement were to touch them they would surely say: ""Ah woe, alas, we were surely sinful.""",45,21,وَلَئِن مَّسَّتْهُمْ نَفْحَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ يَٰوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"O Messenger! If some of punishment of your Lord was to afflict these people who are seeking it hastily, they would then say, “Woe to our destruction and loss! We were wrong in our ascribing partners to Allah and rejecting what Muhammad peace be upon him brought to us!”"
"We shall fix the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection, so that none will be wronged in the least; and even if it were equal to a mustard seed in weight We shall take it (into account). We are sufficient for computation.",46,21,وَنَضَعُ ٱلْمَوَٰزِينَ ٱلْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْـًٔا وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَٰسِبِينَ,"I shall establish fair scales for the rising people to weigh their deeds with. On that day, no soul shall be wronged by having its good deeds decreased, or bad deeds increased. Even if the weighed deed is minute, like the weight equal to a mustard seed, I shall include it. I Myself am sufficient to take the deeds of My servants into account."
"We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and a light and reminder for those who take heed for themselves,",47,21,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ وَضِيَآءً وَذِكْرًا لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"I have given Moses and Aaron peace be upon them both the Torah, which distinguished between the permissible and the impermissible; was a means of guidance for those who believed in it, and a reminder for those who were mindful of their Lord."
Who are fearful of their Lord inwardly and dread the Hour.,48,21,ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَهُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ مُشْفِقُونَ,"Those who fear the punishment of their Lord Who they believe in, despite having not seen Him, and are fearful of the Hour."
And this is a blessed reminder that We have sent down. Will you then deny it?,49,21,وَهَٰذَا ذِكْرٌ مُّبَارَكٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ أَفَأَنتُمْ لَهُۥ مُنكِرُونَ,"This Qur’ān which was revealed onto Muhammad peace be upon him is a reminder and an admonition for those who want to take heed from it. It contains an abundance of benefit and goodness. Despite all that, do you still reject it? Do you not acknowledge its contents, and will you not practice upon it?"
"We had earlier given Abraham true direction, for We knew him well.",50,21,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ رُشْدَهُۥ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِۦ عَٰلِمِينَ,"And I granted Abraham proof against his people in his childhood, and I knew him well. I gave him the proof he deserved according to My knowledge."
"When he said to his father and his people: ""What are these idols to which you cling so passionately?""",51,21,إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِۦ مَا هَٰذِهِ ٱلتَّمَاثِيلُ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَٰكِفُونَ,"When he said to his father Azar and his people, “What are these idols that you have made with your own hands, and which you constantly worship?”"
"They replied: ""We found our fathers worshipping them.""",52,21,قَالُوا۟ وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا لَهَا عَٰبِدِينَ,"His people said to him: “We found our forefathers worshipping them, so we also worshipped them following their example.”"
"He said: ""You and your fathers were in clear error.""",53,21,قَالَ لَقَدْ كُنتُمْ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُمْ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Abraham said to them, “You and your forefathers are in clear deviance from the path of truth!”"
"They said: ""Are you speaking in earnest, or only jesting?""",54,21,قَالُوٓا۟ أَجِئْتَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ أَمْ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱللَّٰعِبِينَ,"His people said to him, “Are you serious about what you said, or are you joking?”"
"He said: ""In fact it was your Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them; and I bear witness to this.",55,21,قَالَ بَل رَّبُّكُمْ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلَّذِى فَطَرَهُنَّ وَأَنَا۠ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكُم مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"Abraham said, “No, I am serious! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; He created them without there having been anything like them previously. I am from those who testify that He is your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and that your idols have no share in that!”"
"I swear by God I will do something to your idols when you have turned your backs and gone.""",56,21,وَتَٱللَّهِ لَأَكِيدَنَّ أَصْنَٰمَكُم بَعْدَ أَن تُوَلُّوا۟ مُدْبِرِينَ,"And in a manner inaudible to his people, Abraham said, “By Allah! Once you have left your idols to go to your festival, I shall hatch a plot concerning them that you shall hate.”"
"So he smashed them up to pieces with the exception of the biggest, so that they may turn to it.",57,21,فَجَعَلَهُمْ جُذَٰذًا إِلَّا كَبِيرًا لَّهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ يَرْجِعُونَ,"So Abraham broke the idols into small pieces, and left the biggest of them hoping that the people return to it to ask it who smashed the others."
"They asked (on return): ""Who has done this to our gods? He is surely a mischief-monger.""",58,21,قَالُوا۟ مَن فَعَلَ هَٰذَا بِـَٔالِهَتِنَآ إِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"So when they returned and found their idols having been smashed into pieces, they asked one another, “Who smashed our idols? Indeed, the one who has smashed them is from the oppressors, due to him having degraded that which deserves reverence and sanctification.”"
"They said: ""We heard a youth talk about them. He is called Abraham.""",59,21,قَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا فَتًى يَذْكُرُهُمْ يُقَالُ لَهُۥٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ,"Those who had heard Abraham take an oath on Allah that he would plot against the idols, said, “We heard a young man talk evil regarding them and finding fault with them. He is known by the name ‘Abraham’; perhaps it is he who smashed them.”"
"""Bring him before the people,"" they said, ""that they may bear witness.""",60,21,قَالُوا۟ فَأْتُوا۟ بِهِۦ عَلَىٰٓ أَعْيُنِ ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْهَدُونَ,"Their chiefs said, “Bring Abraham in front of the people so that they may testify to his confession to what he did, and their confession will be your evidence against him.”"
"""Did you do this to our gods, O Abraham?"" they enquired.",61,21,قَالُوٓا۟ ءَأَنتَ فَعَلْتَ هَٰذَا بِـَٔالِهَتِنَا يَٰٓإِبْرَٰهِيمُ,"So they brought Abraham (peace be upon him) and questioned him, blaming him: “Was it you who did this horrible act to our idols, O Abraham?!”"
"""No,"" he said. ""It was done by that chief of theirs. Ask him in case they can speak.""",62,21,قَالَ بَلْ فَعَلَهُۥ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَٰذَا فَسْـَٔلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُوا۟ يَنطِقُونَ,"Sarcastically, exposing the helplessness of the idols to the people, Abraham said, “I did not do it; rather, the biggest idol did it. Ask your idols, if indeed they are capable of speaking!”"
"Then they thought and observed: ""Surely you are yourselves unjust.""",63,21,فَرَجَعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ فَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّكُمْ أَنتُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"So they turned to one another contemplating and considering. It had become clear to them that their idols do not benefit nor harm in any way, and so they were wrong in worshipping them instead of Allah."
"Then crestfallen (they confessed): ""Truly, as you know, they cannot speak.""",64,21,ثُمَّ نُكِسُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رُءُوسِهِمْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ يَنطِقُونَ,"They then returned to their stubbornness and denial, saying, “O Abraham! You know, surely, that these idols cannot speak, so how can you then tell us to ask them?” They intended it to be an evidence in their favour, but it became an evidence against them."
"(So Abraham) said: ""Then why do you worship something apart from God that cannot profit you or do you harm?",65,21,قَالَ أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَضُرُّكُمْ,"ٌRebuking them, Abraham said, “Do you then worship, instead of Allah, idols that do not benefit nor harm you; that are helpless in removing harm or bringing benefit to even themselves?”"
"Fie on you and those you worship besides God! Will you not understand?""",66,21,أُفٍّ لَّكُمْ وَلِمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Shame on you, and shame upon that which you worship other than Allah, which neither benefit nor harm! Do you not understand that? Will you not leave their worship?"
"They said: ""Burn him, and save your gods, if you are men of action.""",67,21,قَالُوا۟ حَرِّقُوهُ وَٱنصُرُوٓا۟ ءَالِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَٰعِلِينَ,"When they found themselves incapable of countering Abraham with proof, they resorted to force and said, “If you are going to give Abraham a deterring punishment and seek revenge for your idols that he broke and destroyed, then burn him in a fire.”"
"""Turn cold, O fire,"" We said, ""and give safety to Abraham.""",68,21,قُلْنَا يَٰنَارُ كُونِى بَرْدًا وَسَلَٰمًا عَلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ,"They lit a fire and threw Abraham into it, so I said, “O fire! Become cool and safe for Abraham!” And so it became such, and no harm came to him."
"They wished to entrap him, but We made them greater losers.",69,21,وَأَرَادُوا۟ بِهِۦ كَيْدًا فَجَعَلْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرِينَ,"Abraham’s (peace be upon him) people planned to burn him and I foiled their plan. Rather, I made them the ones who were overpowered and destroyed."
"So We delivered him and Lot, and brought them to the land We had blessed for all the people.",70,21,وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَلُوطًا إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلَّتِى بَٰرَكْنَا فِيهَا لِلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"I saved Abraham and I also saved Lot. I expatriated them to the land of Syria that I had blessed, by having sent many prophets to it and by scattering many forms of goodness for the creation."
"And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional gift, and made them righteous.",71,21,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥٓ إِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً وَكُلًّا جَعَلْنَا صَٰلِحِينَ,"And I blessed Abraham with Isaac when he invoked his Lord to grant him a child. In addition, I also blessed him with Jacob. I made each one of the three: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, pious and obedient to Myself."
And We made them leaders to guide (the people) by Our command; and We inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat; and they obeyed Us.,72,21,وَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ فِعْلَ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ وَإِقَامَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَإِيتَآءَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةِ وَكَانُوا۟ لَنَا عَٰبِدِينَ,"I made them into leaders whom the people followed in goodness.With His permission, they would call to the worship of Allah alone. I also revealed to them that they should do good deeds, perform prayer with perfection and give Zakat. They were obedient to Me."
"To Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and saved him from a people who acted villainously and were certainly wicked and disobedient.",73,21,وَلُوطًا ءَاتَيْنَٰهُ حُكْمًا وَعِلْمًا وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِى كَانَت تَّعْمَلُ ٱلْخَبَٰٓئِثَ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَٰسِقِينَ,"ِAnd to Lot I granted the ability to judge fairly between disputing parties, together with sound knowledge of his religion. I also saved him from the punishment I sent upon the people of his village (Sodom) who were involved in immorality. Indeed, they were corrupt people who deviated from the worship of their Lord."
Thus We admitted him to Our grace. He is surely one of the righteous.,74,21,وَأَدْخَلْنَٰهُ فِى رَحْمَتِنَآ إِنَّهُۥ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"And I entered him into My Mercy when I saved him from the punishment that befell his people. Indeed, he was of those who obeyed My commands and stayed away from My prohibitions."
Remember Noah when he called to Us before this. We heard him and saved him and those with him from great distress;,75,21,وَنُوحًا إِذْ نَادَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُۥ فَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"O Messenger! Mention the story of Noah when he called to Allah before Abraham and Lot, and so He accepted his call by granting him what he asked for: Allah saved him and his believing family members from the great sorrow."
"And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs as lies. They were a wicked people indeed, so We drowned them one and all.",76,21,وَنَصَرْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَأَغْرَقْنَٰهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"I saved him from the evil plot of those of his people who rejected the signs that I supported him with; those signs that pointed to his truthfulness. Indeed, they were evil, corrupt people, and so I destroyed them all by drowning them."
"(Remember) David and Solomon, when they pronounced judgement about the field which was eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people. We were witness to their judgement.",77,21,وَدَاوُۥدَ وَسُلَيْمَٰنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى ٱلْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ ٱلْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَٰهِدِينَ,"O Messenger! And mention the story of David and his son Solomon (peace be upon them), when they were passing judgement in the case brought to them regarding the two disputers: One of them had a herd that went into the fields of the other at night. I was witness to the judgement of David and Solomon; no part of their judgement evaded My knowledge."
"We made Solomon understand the case, and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge, We subdued the al-jibal (mountains) with David to sing Our praises, and at-tair (birds). It is We who did it.",78,21,فَفَهَّمْنَٰهَا سُلَيْمَٰنَ وَكُلًّا ءَاتَيْنَا حُكْمًا وَعِلْمًا وَسَخَّرْنَا مَعَ دَاوُۥدَ ٱلْجِبَالَ يُسَبِّحْنَ وَٱلطَّيْرَ وَكُنَّا فَٰعِلِينَ,"I gave full understanding of the case to Solomon instead of his father David; yet I blessed each one with messengership and knowledge of religious law, not exclusively Solomon only. I subjugated the mountains for David, which would glorify Me with his glorifying Me. I also subjugated the birds for him. I was the One Who gave the understanding, the fair judgement, knowledge and it was I who subjugated the mountains and birds."
And We taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each other's violence. Will you not be grateful even then?,79,21,وَعَلَّمْنَٰهُ صَنْعَةَ لَبُوسٍ لَّكُمْ لِتُحْصِنَكُم مِّنۢ بَأْسِكُمْ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ شَٰكِرُونَ,"I exclusively taught David, and not Solomon, the skill of crafting armour, so that you could protect yourselves from anyone who tried to attack you with weapons. O people! Will you then show gratitude for this blessing that I bestowed upon you?"
We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed. We are cognisant of everything.,80,21,وَلِسُلَيْمَٰنَ ٱلرِّيحَ عَاصِفَةً تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِۦٓ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلَّتِى بَٰرَكْنَا فِيهَا وَكُنَّا بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَٰلِمِينَ,"And I subjugated the strong-blowing wind for Solomon. At his command, whenever he would command it to, it would blow to the land of Syria which I had blessed by sending prophets to, and the goodness I spread within it. I am the One Who did everything; nothing evades My knowledge."
"And many of the devils (We also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and We kept watch over them.",81,21,وَمِنَ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينِ مَن يَغُوصُونَ لَهُۥ وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلًا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ وَكُنَّا لَهُمْ حَٰفِظِينَ,I subjugated those Shayāṭīn who would dive into the oceans for him and find pearls etc. among doing other things like construction. I supervised their numbers and work well; nothing escaped My observation.
"(Remember) Job when he called to his Lord: ""I am afflicted with distress, and You are the most compassionate of all.""",82,21,وَأَيُّوبَ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥٓ أَنِّى مَسَّنِىَ ٱلضُّرُّ وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"O Messenger! Mention the story of Job, when he prayed to his Lord at the time of affliction, saying, “O my Lord! I have been afflicted with an illness and loss of family, yet you are the most merciful from all those who show mercy, so remove the afflictions that have befallen me.”"
"So We heard his cry and relieved him of the misery he was in. We restored his family to him, and along with them gave him others similar to them as a grace from Us and reminder for those who are obedient.",83,21,فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُۥ فَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِۦ مِن ضُرٍّ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ أَهْلَهُۥ وَمِثْلَهُم مَّعَهُمْ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْعَٰبِدِينَ,"And so I accepted his prayer and removed the harm that had befallen him; I granted him not just the family he had lost, but also more along with them. I did all that out of My Mercy, and so that it serves as a reminder for each subservient worshipper of Allah, in order that he may bear patience just as Job bore patience."
"(Remember) Ishmael, Edris and Dhu'l-Kifl. They were men of fortitude,",84,21,وَإِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَإِدْرِيسَ وَذَا ٱلْكِفْلِ كُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"O Messenger! Also mention Ishmael, Enoch and Ezekiel, (peace be upon them). Each one of them were from the patient ones at times of suffering and on whatever responsibility Allah placed on them."
And they were admitted to Our grace. Verily they were among the doers of good.,85,21,وَأَدْخَلْنَٰهُمْ فِى رَحْمَتِنَآ إِنَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"I enveloped them into My Mercy: I made them prophets and granted them entry into paradise. Indeed, they were from those pious servants of Mine who acted within My obedience, and whose private and public lives were ones of piety."
"And (remember) Dhu'n-Noon (Jonah of the fish), when he went away in anger and imagined We will not test him (with distress). Then he called out from the darkness: ""There is no god other than You. All glory to You; surely I was a sinner.",86,21,وَذَا ٱلنُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَٰضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ فَنَادَىٰ فِى ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ أَن لَّآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنتَ سُبْحَٰنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Messenger! Also mention the story of the Companion of the Whale: Jonah (peace be upon him), when he went away without the permission of his Lord, angry with his people for their insistence on sin. He thought I would not constrain him by punishing him for his hurrying away; and so he was afflicted with a severe form of constraint and imprisonment when the Whale swallowed him. He then called out in the darknesses of the belly of the Whale, the ocean and the night, acknowledging his error and repenting to Allah for it, saying, “There is no true deity except You, You are glorified of all faults and sanctified. Indeed, I was one of the wrongdoers.”"
"We heard his cry, and saved him from the anguish. That is how We deliver those who believe.",87,21,فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُۥ وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلْغَمِّ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُۨجِى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"So I accepted his call and saved him from that severe distress by taking him out from all the darknesses including from the belly of the Whale. Just like I saved Jonah from this distress of his, I also save the believers when they fall into distress and call out to Me for help."
"(Remember) Zachariah when he called to his Lord: ""Do not leave me alone (and childless), for you are the best of givers.""",88,21,وَزَكَرِيَّآ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥ رَبِّ لَا تَذَرْنِى فَرْدًا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْوَٰرِثِينَ,"O Messenger! Also mention the story of Zechariah (peace be upon him), when he prayed to his Lord saying, “O my Lord! Do not leave me alone without any children. You are the best of the living, so grant me a child that lives after me.”"
"So We heard him and gave him John, and cured his wife (of barrenness). These were men who vied in good deeds with one another, and prayed to Us with love and awe, and were meek before Us.",89,21,فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُۥ وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥ يَحْيَىٰ وَأَصْلَحْنَا لَهُۥ زَوْجَهُۥٓ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا وَكَانُوا۟ لَنَا خَٰشِعِينَ,"I accepted his prayer for him, and granted him a child in John. In the process, I also cured his wife, who had been barren up until that point. Indeed, Zechariah, his wife and son were quick in doing good deeds, and would call out to Me eager in My reward and fearful of My punishment. They would frequently supplicate to Me."
"(Remember) her who preserved her chastity, into whom We breathed a new life from Us, and made her and her son a token for mankind.",90,21,وَٱلَّتِىٓ أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهَا مِن رُّوحِنَا وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا وَٱبْنَهَآ ءَايَةً لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Messenger! Also mention the story of Mary peace be upon her, who protected herself from fornication. Allah then sent Gabriel (peace be upon him) to her, and he blew into her. Consequently, she became pregnant with Jesus (peace be upon him); they were both signs for the people of the Power of Allah, and proofs that nothing is beyond Allah’s capability such that He created Jesus without a father."
"Verily this your order is one order, and I am your Lord; so worship Me.",91,21,إِنَّ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَأَنَا۠ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,"O people! This is your creed; one and only creed. It is monotheism which is the religion of Islam. I am your Lord, so make worship exclusive to Me alone."
But they split up the order among themselves; (yet) all of them have to come back to Me.,92,21,وَتَقَطَّعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ كُلٌّ إِلَيْنَا رَٰجِعُونَ,"The people differed: some were monotheists, idolaters, disbelievers and believers. All these different types of people will return to Me alone on the Day of Judgment, when I shall requit them according to their deeds."
"So he who does the right and is a believer, will not have his labour denied, for We are congnisant of it.",93,21,فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَا كُفْرَانَ لِسَعْيِهِۦ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ كَٰتِبُونَ,"So whosoever from among them did good deeds, whilst he believed in Allah, His messengers and in the last day, will not be denied the due of his good deeds. Rather, Allah will multiply his reward for him and he will find it recorded in his book of deeds on the day he is resurrected for which he will be pleased."
It is imperative that a habitation We have destroyed will not desist (from unbelief),94,21,وَحَرَٰمٌ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَٰهَآ أَنَّهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ,"It is impossible for the people of a village I destroyed due to their disbelief that they return to the world to repent, and that I accept their repentance."
"Until when the way is opened up for Gog and Magog and they press from every elevated place,",95,21,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُم مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ,"They will never return, even until the barrier of Gog and Magog is opened and they begin emerging, hurriedly descending from every high piece of land."
"And the certain promise (of Doom) comes near. Then the eyes of unbelievers will be fixed in horror, (and they will cry:) ""Ah, woe betide, we were indeed heedless of this, and were oppressors and unjust.""",96,21,وَٱقْتَرَبَ ٱلْوَعْدُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَإِذَا هِىَ شَٰخِصَةٌ أَبْصَٰرُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَٰوَيْلَنَا قَدْ كُنَّا فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَٰذَا بَلْ كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"Their emergence, terror and violence will be a sign of the rising drawing nearer. The disbelievers will be left wide-eyed in horror, saying: Oh my, what a destruction faces us! We were indulged in futility in the world, preoccupied from preparing for this severe day. Rather, we were wrongdoers by disbelieving and committing sins."
Verily you and those you worship other than God will be faggots for Hell; and come to it you will.,97,21,إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَٰرِدُونَ,"O idolaters! You and whatever you worship instead of Allah, together with whoever is content with you worshipping them, shall be the fuel of hellfire. You and everything you worship will surely enter it."
Had they really been gods they would not have entered it: They will all abide in it for ever.,98,21,لَوْ كَانَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"If these worshipped things were in reality gods that were worthy of being worshipped, they would not be entering the hellfire with their worshippers. Yet they shall all be entering it, having to remain in it forever, never to come out of it."
"There will only be groaning for them, and they will not hear any thing.",99,21,لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا لَا يَسْمَعُونَ,"Due to the severity of torture they shall face, they shall wail and breathe sharply. They will not be able to hear sounds due to the immense horrific torment that will afflict them."
"But those for whom a good reward had been fore-ordained by Us, will be far removed from it,",100,21,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُم مِّنَّا ٱلْحُسْنَىٰٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ,"When the idolaters said, “Indeed, Jesus and the angels whom were worshipped, will therefore enter the hellfire!” Allah said, “Verily, those regarding whom it was decreed in the Knowledge of Allah that they would be from the people of good fortune, like Jesus (peace be upon him), will be kept away from the hellfire.”"
"And will not hear its hissing, and will live for ever in the midst of what their hearts desire.",101,21,لَا يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا وَهُمْ فِى مَا ٱشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَٰلِدُونَ,"The sound of Hell shall not reach their ears, while they shall reside among whatever bounties their hearts desire. These bounties shall never finish."
"They will have safety from the mighty terror, and angels will receive them, (saying:) ""This is your day which had been promised you.""",102,21,لَا يَحْزُنُهُمُ ٱلْفَزَعُ ٱلْأَكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّىٰهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ هَٰذَا يَوْمُكُمُ ٱلَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,"The great horror of the hellfire when it surrounds its inhabitants shall not scare them, and the angels will welcome them with glad tidings, saying: “This is your day that you were promised in the world; the one you were given glad tidings of receiving bounties in!”"
"The day We shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll, We shall revert it (to nothing) as it was before We first created it. This is a promise incumbent on Us; We will certainly fulfil it.",103,21,يَوْمَ نَطْوِى ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَطَىِّ ٱلسِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ كَمَا بَدَأْنَآ أَوَّلَ خَلْقٍ نُّعِيدُهُۥ وَعْدًا عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا فَٰعِلِينَ,"On the day in which I shall roll up the heavens like the rolling up of a scroll, and congregate the creation in the state they were created in the first instance. I have promised that it will happen; a promise that there is no going back on. I shall indeed fulfil My promise."
"We had prescribed in the Book of Psalms after the reminder and admonition, that those of Our creatures who are good will in the end rule the earth.",104,21,وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى ٱلزَّبُورِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلذِّكْرِ أَنَّ ٱلْأَرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ ٱلصَّٰلِحُونَ,"I had indeed written in the books I revealed unto the messengers, after I had written it in the Preserved Tablet, that the earth would be ruled by the pious, obedient servants of Allah: they are the nation of Muhammad peace be upon him."
Verily there is a message in this for people who are devout.,105,21,إِنَّ فِى هَٰذَا لَبَلَٰغًا لِّقَوْمٍ عَٰبِدِينَ,"Verily, in the admonition I revealed, there is a message for those who worship their Lord according to what He has legislated for them. It is they who truly benefit from it."
We have sent you as a benevolence to the creatures of the world.,106,21,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Muhammad! I have not sent you as a messenger, except as a merciful one to the whole of creation. This is because you are distinguished with aspiring for the guidance of all people and their safety from the punishment of Allah."
"Say: ""This is what has been revealed to me: 'Your God is one and only God.' So will you bow in homage to Him?""",107,21,قُلْ إِنَّمَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: It is only revealed to me from my Lord that your true deity is only One; He has no partner, and He is Allah. So submit to believing in Him, and acting in His obedience."
"If they turn away, tell them: ""I have warned you all alike. I do not know if what has been promised you is near or far away.",108,21,فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَقُلْ ءَاذَنتُكُمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَآءٍ وَإِنْ أَدْرِىٓ أَقَرِيبٌ أَم بَعِيدٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ,"O Messenger! If these people turn away from that which you have brought to them, then say to them, “I am informing you that we are both in agreement that we are different, and I do not know when the punishment Allah promised you with, will descend upon you.”"
"He knows surely what you say aloud, and what you hide within your breasts.",109,21,إِنَّهُۥ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْجَهْرَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْتُمُونَ,"Indeed, Allah knows of the speech you disclose, and He knows of that which you keep secret. Nothing from either evades Him, and He will requit you for it."
"I do not know if this be a trial for you, or a little advantage for a while.""",110,21,وَإِنْ أَدْرِى لَعَلَّهُۥ فِتْنَةٌ لَّكُمْ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"I do not know whether your respite from being punished is a test for you, or whether it is to lure you further into destruction, and to give you freedom until a time decreed in the Knowledge of Allah, so that you persist in your disbelief and error."
"""Judge in truth (between us), O Lord,"" he said. ""Our Lord is merciful, whose help we seek against what you attribute.""",111,21,قَٰلَ رَبِّ ٱحْكُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَرَبُّنَا ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ ٱلْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ,"Supplicating to his Lord, the Messenger of Allah peace be upon him said, “O my Lord! Judge well between us and those of our people who have persisted on disbelief. We seek help from our Lord alone, against your statements of disbelief and rejection.”"
"O YOU PEOPLE, fear your Lord. The great upheaval of the Hour will indeed be terrible.",0,22,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ,"O people, be mindful of your Lord by carrying out what He has ordered you and desisting from what He has forbidden you. The earthquake and other horrors that will accompany the Day of Judgment are a grave matter, for which it is necessary to prepare through actions which please Allah."
"The day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. You will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication. The torment of God will be severe.",1,22,يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ وَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلنَّاسَ سُكَٰرَىٰ وَمَا هُم بِسُكَٰرَىٰ وَلَٰكِنَّ عَذَابَ ٱللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ,"On the day you see it, every nursing mother shall be absentminded of her nursing child and every pregnant being will abort her pregnancy, due to intense fear. You shall see people, because of losing their senses, like drunkards, due to the severe horror of the standing. They will not be drunk out of drinking alcohol, but rather the punishment of Allah is severe, thus it has made them loses their senses."
"And yet there are men who contend about God without understanding, and follow every wayward devil",2,22,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَٰدِلُ فِى ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَٰنٍ مَّرِيدٍ,"Amongst people there is he who argues regarding Allah’s power to resurrect the dead, without any knowledge to take support from, and who in his belief and saying follows every satan and misguided leader who is rebellious against his Lord."
"Who, it is inscribed, will beguile whoever follows him, and lead him to the torment of Hell.",3,22,كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِ أَنَّهُۥ مَن تَوَلَّاهُ فَأَنَّهُۥ يُضِلُّهُۥ وَيَهْدِيهِ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"It is decreed regarding such rebellious humans and jinns that whoever follows him and accepts him, he will lead them astray from the path of truth, and he will drag him towards the fire of Hell through the disbelief and sins which lead towards it."
"If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you. We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once. You see the earth all withered, then We send down rain upon it, and it bestirs itself, swells, and brings forth every kind of beauteous verdure.",4,22,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ ٱلْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَٰكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى ٱلْأَرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلًا ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوٓا۟ أَشُدَّكُمْ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُتَوَفَّىٰ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰٓ أَرْذَلِ ٱلْعُمُرِ لِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا وَتَرَى ٱلْأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَآءَ ٱهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنۢبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍۭ بَهِيجٍ,"O people, if you have any doubt regarding My power to resurrect you after your death, think about your creation: I created your father Adam from soil; then I created his children from sperm which the man casts into the woman’s womb; then the sperm turns into solid blood; then the solid blood turns into a piece of meat; then the piece of meat turns into either a sound creation which remains in the womb until it comes out alive as a child or into an unsound form which the womb aborts, to show My power by creating you in stages. And I settle in the wombs whatever fetus I wish until it is born in a fixed time period of nine months. Then I take you out of your mothers’ wombs as children, so that you reach the pinnacle of strength and intelligence. Amongst you are some who die before this and amongst you are those who reach old age where strength and intelligence weaken, to the extent that he becomes worse than a child, no longer knowing anything he used to know. And you will see the earth dry without any plants on it. Then when I send down rainwater on it, it opens up with plants, rises due to the plants growing, and brings forth every type of beautiful plant."
"That is so for God is the undeniable Reality. It is He who brings the dead to life, for He has power over everything.",5,22,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّهُۥ يُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَأَنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"That which I have mentioned to you, namely the beginning of your creation, its stages and the conditions of those born amongst you, is so that you believe that Allah Who created you is the Truth in which there is no doubt, as opposed to the idols you worship, and so that you believe He will restore the dead, and that He has power over everything."
"The Hour will come without a doubt, and God will raise those who are dead.",6,22,وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ,"And so that you believe the Hour is to come, without any doubt in its coming, and that Allah will resurrect the dead from their graves to reward them for their actions."
"Yet there are some who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or enlightening Book,",7,22,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَٰدِلُ فِى ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلَا هُدًى وَلَا كِتَٰبٍ مُّنِيرٍ,"Among the disbelievers is he who argues regarding the oneness of Allah and regarding His sending His Messenger with guidance, without any proof from sound reasoning or clear sound texts, but solely due to his desires."
"Turning their backs that they may lead away from the path of God. For such there is disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement We shall make them taste the torment of burning.",8,22,ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِۦ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُۥ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْىٌ وَنُذِيقُهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,"Turning his neck in arrogance, to turn people away from faith and entering the religion of Allah. He who fits this description shall have disgrace in this world due to the punishment which will befall him, and I shall make him taste the punishment of the burning fire in the Hearafter."
That is on account of what you had done in the past; yet God is not unjust to His creatures.,9,22,ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاكَ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,It will be said to him: “That punishment which you tasted is due to the disbelief and sins you committed. Allah does not punish any of His creation except due to a sin”.
"There are some men who worship God only from the margin. If there is some profit they are content; but if calamity befalls them they turn about, thus losing both this world and the next. This is indeed a palpable loss.",10,22,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُۥ خَيْرٌ ٱطْمَأَنَّ بِهِۦ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ ٱنقَلَبَ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِۦ خَسِرَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةَ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْخُسْرَانُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"Amongst people is a confused person who worships Allah in doubt. If good such as health and wealth come to him, he remains on his faith and worship of Allah, but if he is afflicted by an affliction through illness or poverty, he takes bad omen from his religion and then renounces it. He has lost his world, because his disbelief will never increase him in a share of the world which was not written for him, and he has lost his afterlife due to the punishment of Allah which will meet him. That is the clear loss."
Leaving God they pray to those who cannot harm or profit them. That is the limit of going astray.,11,22,يَدْعُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُۥ وَمَا لَا يَنفَعُهُۥ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلضَّلَٰلُ ٱلْبَعِيدُ,"He worships besides Allah idols which cannot harm him if he disobeys them, nor can they benefit him if he obeys them. That calling upon idols which can neither harm nor benefit is the misguidance far from the truth."
They pray to him whose bane is more imminent than his boon: How bad the protector and how bad the associate!,12,22,يَدْعُوا۟ لَمَن ضَرُّهُۥٓ أَقْرَبُ مِن نَّفْعِهِۦ لَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْعَشِيرُ,"This disbeliever who worships idols calls upon the one whose confirmed harm is closer than his absent benefit. Bad is the deity whose harm is closer than his benefit. Bad is it as a helper to one who seeks its help, and as a companion to who accompanies it."
God will admit those who believe and do the right to gardens full of rippling streams. Verily God does as He pleases.,13,22,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ,"Allah will enter those who have faith in Him and do good actions into gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow. Allah does what He pleases, by having mercy on whom He wants to show mercy and punishing whom He wants to punish. Nothing can compel Him."
He who thinks that God will not help him in this world and the next should stretch a rope to the sky then cut it off and see if his mind is relieved (of doubts) by this stratagem.,14,22,مَن كَانَ يَظُنُّ أَن لَّن يَنصُرَهُ ٱللَّهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ بِسَبَبٍ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ثُمَّ لْيَقْطَعْ فَلْيَنظُرْ هَلْ يُذْهِبَنَّ كَيْدُهُۥ مَا يَغِيظُ,"Whoever thinks Allah will not help His Prophet (peace be upon him) in this world and the afterlife should extend a rope to the ceiling of his house and then hang himself by cutting himself off the ground. Then he should see if that removes the anger he feels in his heart. Allah is the Helper of His Prophet, whether his opponents like it or not."
"That is why We have sent down these clear revelations, for God gives guidance whomsoever He please.",15,22,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يُرِيدُ,"Just as I explained the clear proofs for resurrection, I revealed the Qur’ān to Muhammad (peace be upon him) as clear verses, and Allah enables whomever He wishes through His grace to the path of guidance and righteousness."
"God will judge between those who believe and the Jews, the Sabians, Christians and the Magians and the idolaters, on the Day of Judgement. Verily God is witness to everything.",16,22,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلصَّٰبِـِٔينَ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ وَٱلْمَجُوسَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,"Those who have faith in Allah, and they are: the believers from this nation, the Jews, the Sabians (a group of followers of one of the prophets), the Christians, the Magians (fire-worshippers), the idolaters; Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, then He will enter the believers amongst them into paradise and enter others into hellfire. Allah is a Witness to all the sayings and actions of His servants, with nothing being hidden from Him, and He shall reward them for these actions."
"Do you see how all things in heavens and the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, trees and beasts, and men in abundance, pay homage to God? Yet there are many who deserve the punishment. And whosoever God disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour. God does verily as He will.",17,22,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ وَٱلنُّجُومُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ وَٱلشَّجَرُ وَٱلدَّوَآبُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَمَن يُهِنِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِن مُّكْرِمٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ,"O Messenger, do you not know that to Allah prostrate, out of obedience, the angels in the heavens and the believing humans and jinns on earth, and the sun, moon, stars in the sky, the mountains, trees, and creatures on earth, compliantly? And many humans prostrate to Him out of obedience. But many refuse to prostrate to Him out of obedience, thus the punishment of Allah became established for them due to their disbelief. Whoever Allah decrees disgrace and shame for, due to his disbelief, has nobody to honour him. Allah does what He wishes. There is nobody to compel Him."
"These two (believers and unbelievers) are disputants, who contend about their Lord. But they who disbelieve will be fitted out with garments of flames. Boiling water will be poured down over their heads",18,22,هَٰذَانِ خَصْمَانِ ٱخْتَصَمُوا۟ فِى رَبِّهِمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ ٱلْحَمِيمُ,"These are two parties arguing regarding their Lord, as to which of them is right: the party of faith and party of disbelief. The party of disbelief will be encompassed by the fire, just as clothes cover the person wearing them, and extremely hot water will be poured on top of their heads."
"Which will dissolve everything within their bellies, and their skins.",19,22,يُصْهَرُ بِهِۦ مَا فِى بُطُونِهِمْ وَٱلْجُلُودُ,"The intestines in their stomachs will melt with it, due to its intense heat, and it will reach their skins and melt them."
There are iron maces for them.,20,22,وَلَهُم مَّقَٰمِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ,"They will have iron hammers in the fire, with which the angels will hit their heads."
"As often as they try to escape from its anguish they would be put back into (the fire), and taste the torment of burning.",21,22,كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُوٓا۟ أَن يَخْرُجُوا۟ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُوا۟ فِيهَا وَذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,"Whenever they will try to leave the fire, due to the severe anxiety they will face in it, they will be returned to it and they will be told: “Taste the punishment of the burning fire”."
"God will surely admit those who believe and do the right to gardens with rivers running by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold and of pearls; and of silk will be their garments.",22,22,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤًا وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ,"The party of faith, and they are those who have faith in Allah and do good actions, will be entered by Allah in gardens under whose palaces and trees rivers will flow. Allah will adorn them by giving them gold bracelets and He will adorn them by giving them pearls, and their clothes therein will be silk."
"They will be guided with gentle words, and guided to the commended path.",23,22,وَهُدُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلطَّيِّبِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَهُدُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,"Allah guided them in the worldly life towards pleasant sayings, such as testifying there is no god besides Allah, proclaiming the greatness of Allah and praising Him, and He guided them towards the praiseworthy path of Islam."
"As for those who disbelieve, and obstruct the way of God and the holy Mosque which We have set down for all men, the native and the visitor alike. Whoever puts obstructions in this mischievously will taste of painful punishment.",24,22,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلْنَٰهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً ٱلْعَٰكِفُ فِيهِ وَٱلْبَادِ وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍۭ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah, turn others away from entering Islam and stop people from the Sacred Mosque, like what the idolaters did in the year of Hudaiybiyah, that mosque which I made a direction for people in their prayers and one of the rites of Hajj and Umrah, and in which the person from Makkah who lives there and one who comes there besides the people of Makkah are the same; whoever intends to purposefully commit a shameful sin therein, I will make him taste a painful punishment."
"When We chose the site of the House for Abraham (We said:) ""Associate no one with Me, and clean My House for those who will circumambulate it, stand (in reverence), and bow in homage.",25,22,وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لِإِبْرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلْبَيْتِ أَن لَّا تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْـًٔا وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِىَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلْقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,"Remember, O Messenger, when I clarified for Abraham (peace be upon him) the place of the house and its limits, after it was unknown, and I revealed to him not to associate anything in worshipping Me, but rather worship Me alone. And purify My House from physical and immaterial impurities for those who circumambulate it and perform prayer therein."
"Announce the Pilgrimage to the people. They will come to you on foot and riding along distant roads on lean and slender beasts,",26,22,وَأَذِّن فِى ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَجِّ يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالًا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ يَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٍ,"Proclaim amongst the people, calling them towards pilgrimage of this House I ordered you to build. They will come to you walking and riding on every camel which is frail due to the difficulty it endured from travelling. The camels will bring them, carrying them from every distant path."
"In order to reach the place of advantage for them, and to pronounce the name of God on appointed days over cattle He has given them for food; then eat of the meat and feed the needy and the poor.",27,22,لِّيَشْهَدُوا۟ مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمْ وَيَذْكُرُوا۟ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ فِىٓ أَيَّامٍ مَّعْلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ فَكُلُوا۟ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُوا۟ ٱلْبَآئِسَ ٱلْفَقِيرَ,"So that they come to what will bring them benefit such as forgiveness of sins, attaining reward, unity of word, and so forth; and so that they remember Allah on the animals they slaughter in the known days, which are: the tenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah and three days after it, in gratitude to Allah for the camels, cows and sheep He granted them. So eat of these animals and feed from them those who are extremely poor."
"Let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage, fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient House.",28,22,ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُوا۟ تَفَثَهُمْ وَلْيُوفُوا۟ نُذُورَهُمْ وَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا۟ بِٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْعَتِيقِ,"Then they should complete what remains of their Hajj rites, coming out of ihraam by shaving their heads, clipping their nails, and removing the dirt which has accumulated on them due to ihraam, and fulfil the Hajj, Umrah or sacrificial animal they made binding on themselves. They should perform the Tawaaf Ifadah of the House which Allah freed from the control of tyrants."
"Apart from this, whoever respects the sacred ordinances of God, will find a better reward for him with his Lord. You are allowed to eat all cattle except those already mentioned to you. Avoid the repugnance of idols, and false and frivolous talk.",29,22,ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ ٱلرِّجْسَ مِنَ ٱلْأَوْثَٰنِ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ قَوْلَ ٱلزُّورِ,"That which you have been ordered, i.e., coming out of ihraam by shaving the head, clipping the nails, removing dirt, fulfilling the vow and circumambulating the House, is what Allah has made obligatory on you. So respect what Allah has made obligatory on you. Whoever refrains from what Allah has ordered him to refrain from during his ihraam, out of respect for not trespassing the limits of Allah and making lawful its prohibitions, it is better for him in this world and the afterlife in the sight of his Lord. O people, camels, cows and sheep amongst livestock have been made lawful for you. He did not make unlawful for you hami, bahirah or wasilah. He only made unlawful for you what you find in the Qur’ān, such as carrion, blood and so forth. Stay far from the impurity of idols and stay far from lying and false evidence."
Turn uprightly to God without ascribing compeers to Him; for he who associates any one with God is like a thing that falls from the sky and is either snatched away by birds or carried far away by the wind.,30,22,حُنَفَآءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِۦ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِى بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِى مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ,"Refrain from this, turning away from every religion besides the religion He is pleased with, without associating any partner with Him in worship. Whoever associates a partner with Allah, it is as though He has fallen from the sky, then either the birds snatch his meat and bones or the wind flings him to a distant place."
"All this, and honouring the offerings to God, comes from purity of heart.",31,22,ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَٰٓئِرَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى ٱلْقُلُوبِ,"That is what Allah ordered, namely His oneness, being sincere to Him, and refraining from idols and false speech. Whoever respects the signs of the religion, amongst them sacrificial animals and the rites of Hajj, respecting them is part of the hearts being mindful of their Lord."
", There are advantages for you in these (cattle) up to a time, then their place is the ancient House for sacrifice.",32,22,لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَٰفِعُ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ مَحِلُّهَآ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْعَتِيقِ,"For you in the sacrificial animals that you slaughter at the House are benefits, such as riding, wool, procreation, milk, until a limited time to the time of their slaughter near the House of Allah which He freed from the control of tyrants."
"For every community We have ordained certain rites that they may commemorate the name of God by reading it over the cattle We have given them for sacrifice. Your God is one God, so be obedient to Him. Give good tidings to those who bow in obedience to God,",33,22,وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ جَعَلْنَا مَنسَكًا لِّيَذْكُرُوا۟ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ فَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَلَهُۥٓ أَسْلِمُوا۟ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُخْبِتِينَ,"For every previous nation I made rites to shed blood, as a means of closeness to Allah, in the hope they will remember Allah at the time of slaughtering these sacrificial animals, and in gratitude to Allah for the camels, cows and sheep He granted them. Your true god, O people, is One God who has no partner, so submit to Him alone through submission and obedience. And O Messenger, tell those who are humbly submissive and sincere what will please them."
"Whose hearts are filled with awe when the name of God is mentioned before them, who endure with fortitude what befalls them, and fulfil their moral obligations, and expend of what We have given them.",34,22,ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَصَابَهُمْ وَٱلْمُقِيمِى ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"Those who when they remember Allah, fear His punishment and thus move far away from opposing His command, perform their prayer completely, be patient if any affliction befalls them, and spend in the different avenues of righteousness from what Allah has granted them."
"We have made the camels signs of God for you. There is good for you in this. So pronounce the name of God over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line. When they have fallen (slaughtered) on their sides, eat of (their meat) and feed those who are content with little, and those who supplicate. That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful.",35,22,وَٱلْبُدْنَ جَعَلْنَٰهَا لَكُم مِّن شَعَٰٓئِرِ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا فَكُلُوا۟ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُوا۟ ٱلْقَانِعَ وَٱلْمُعْتَرَّ كَذَٰلِكَ سَخَّرْنَٰهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"And I have made the camels which are taken to the House amongst the sacred signs and symbols of the religion. In them are worldly and religious benefits for you, so say “in the name of Allah” when slaughtering them, after their feet have been lined up whilst standing and one of their feet has been tied so that they do not flee. Then when they fall on their sides after being slaughtered, eat of them, O those who are sacrificing, and give of them to the pauper who desists from begging and the pauper who comes forward to be granted a share of them. Just as I made them submissive to you so that you carry loads on them and ride them, I have also made them submissive to you so they are led to the place you slaughter them in, as a means of closeness to Allah, so that you are grateful to Allah for the blessing of making them submissive to you."
It is not their meat or blood that reaches God: It is the fealty of your heart that reaches him. That is why He has subjugated them to you that you may glorify God for having shown you the way. So give glad tidings to those who are doers of good.,36,22,لَن يَنَالَ ٱللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَٰكِن يَنَالُهُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ سَخَّرَهَا لَكُمْ لِتُكَبِّرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Neither does the meat of the sacrificial animals you present nor their blood ever reach Allah, nor is it raised towards Him, but rather your mindfulness of Allah therein is raised towards Him, through your being sincere to Him in your obedience to seek closeness to Him through it. In that way, Allah made them submissive to you, so that you proclaim Allah’s greatness, thanking Him for the truth He has guided you to. O Messenger, inform those who are excellent in worshipping their Lord and in dealing with His creation what will make them happy."
God will certainly defend the believers. Surely God does not like the traitors who deny the truth.,37,22,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدَٰفِعُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ خَوَّانٍ كَفُورٍ,"Allah defends those who have faith from the evil of their enemies. Allah does not love anyone who is treacherous in his trust and who rejects the blessings of Allah; in fact, Allah despises him."
Permission is granted those (to take up arms) who fight because they were oppressed. God is certainly able to give help to those,38,22,أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَٰتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا۟ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ,"Allah has given permission to fight to the believers who are fought by the idolaters, due to their being oppressed by their enemies. Allah has the power to help the believers against their enemies without fighting. However, the wisdom of Allah required that the believers be tested through fighting the disbelievers."
"Who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said: ""Our Lord is God."" And if God had not restrained some men through some others, monastries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where the name of God is honoured most, would have been razed. God will surely help those who help Him, -- verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty, --",39,22,ٱلَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ إِلَّآ أَن يَقُولُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَٰمِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَٰتٌ وَمَسَٰجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيرًا وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"Those whom the disbelievers unjustly exiled from their homes, not due to any crime they committed but because they said: “Our Lord is Allah; we have no Lord besides Him”. Had Allah not legislated for the prophets and believers fighting against their enemies, they would have invaded the places of worship, destroying the monasteries of the monks, Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, and the mosques of the Muslims which have been made for prayer and in which the Muslims remember Allah abundantly. Allah will help those who help His religion and Prophet. Allah has power to help whoever helps His religion and is Mighty, with nobody able to overcome Him."
"Those who would be firm in devotion, give zakat, and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, if We gave them authority in the land. But the resultance of things rests with God.",40,22,ٱلَّذِينَ إِن مَّكَّنَّٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَوُا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَأَمَرُوا۟ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْا۟ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَلِلَّهِ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْأُمُورِ,"These people who have been promised help are those who, if I were to establish on earth by helping them against their enemies, would perform prayer in the most perfect manner, give Zakat of their wealth, command what the sacred law has commanded and forbid what it has forbidden. To Allah alone is where matters return, with respect to reward and punishment."
"If they accuse you of falsehood, (remember that) the people of Noah, 'Ad and Thamud had accused (their apostles) before,",41,22,وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَعَادٌ وَثَمُودُ,"O Messenger, if your people reject you, be patient. You are not the first messenger to be rejected by his people. Before your people, the people of Noah rejected Noah, Aad rejected Hud and Thamud rejected Salih."
"And the people of Abraham and Lot,",42,22,وَقَوْمُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَقَوْمُ لُوطٍ,The people of Abraham rejected Abraham and the people of Lot rejected Lot.
And the people of Midian too. Moses was also accused of lies. So I allowed the infidels respite and then seized them. How was My reprobation then!,43,22,وَأَصْحَٰبُ مَدْيَنَ وَكُذِّبَ مُوسَىٰ فَأَمْلَيْتُ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,"The people of Madyan rejected Shuayb, and Pharaoh and his people rejected Moses. I deferred the punishment from their people, to gradually lead them away, then I seized them with the punishment. So contemplate how I reproached them; I destroyed them due to their disbelief."
"How many a habitation given to wickedness have We destroyed, whose roofs tumbled down, which fell into ruins. How many a well and fortress reinforced lie abandoned!",44,22,فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَٰهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا وَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ وَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ,"How many cities, which were unjust because of their disbelief, I destroyed with obliterating punishment. Their homes are ruined and empty of inhabitants. How many wells are there which have nobody to drink from them, due to their being destroyed. How many lofty decorated palaces are there which could not save their residents from the punishment."
"Have they not travelled in the land that they could have the heart to understand, and ears to hear? It is not the eyes alone that do not see, oblivious are the hearts within their breasts.",45,22,أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى ٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ وَلَٰكِن تَعْمَى ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٱلَّتِى فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Did these people who reject what the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought not travel in the land, to see the remains of these destroyed cities, so that they would reflect with their minds to take heed and so that they would to accept their stories to learn from them? It is established that blindness is not blindness of eyesight, but rather the blindness which is destructive is blindness of insight, where such a person does not reflect or take lessons."
That is how they ask you to hasten the punishment; but God does not go back on His promise. Verily a day with your Lord is equal by your reckoning to a thousand years.,46,22,وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَن يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُۥ وَإِنَّ يَوْمًا عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ,"O Messenger, the disbelievers amongst your people seek quick punishment in this world and deferred punishment in the Hearafter, when they were warned of them. Allah will never break the promise of it He has made to them. Amongst the quick punishment is what befell them on the day of Badr. And one day of punishment in the afterlife is like a thousand years of what you count in worldly years, due to the punishment it contains."
"To how many habitations did We give respite, though given to wickedness, and then seized them. To Me they had to come back in the end.",47,22,وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"How many towns are there which I gave respite to in punishment and which were oppressive due to their disbelief. I did not punish them instantly, to gradually lead them on, then I seized them by an obliterating punishment. To Me alone is their return on the Day of Judgment, then I will reward them for their disbelief with the everlasting punishment."
"Tell them: ""O men, it's my duty to warn you clearly.""",48,22,قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"O people, I am only a warner to you, conveying to you what I have been sent with and clear in my warning."
For those who believe and do the right is forgiveness and gracious provision.,49,22,فَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,"So those who have faith and did good actions will have forgiveness from their Lord for their sins, and for them is noble sustenance in paradise which will never end."
But those who try to defeat Our signs are people of Hell.,50,22,وَٱلَّذِينَ سَعَوْا۟ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا مُعَٰجِزِينَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Those who strive to deny our verses, believing they will be able to render Allah powerless and escape Him so that He cannot punish them, those are the people of the fire of hell, staying constantly in it just as companions stay with one another."
"We have sent no messenger or apostle before you with whose recitations Satan did not tamper. Yet God abrogates what Satan interpolates; then He confirms His revelations, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",51,22,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ وَلَا نَبِىٍّ إِلَّآ إِذَا تَمَنَّىٰٓ أَلْقَى ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فِىٓ أُمْنِيَّتِهِۦ فَيَنسَخُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يُلْقِى ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"O Messenger, I did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he read the Book of Allah, the satan put doubts in his recitation. Then Allah would nullify the whisperings the satan would put, and establish His verses. Allah knows everything, nothing being hidden from Him, and is Wise in His creating, decreeing and planning."
This is in order to make the interpolations of Satan a test for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened: Surely the sinners have gone far in dissent.,52,22,لِّيَجْعَلَ مَا يُلْقِى ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ لَفِى شِقَاقٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"The satan puts doubts in the recitation of the Prophet so that Allah makes what he puts as a test for the hypocrites and those idolaters whose hearts have become hard. The oppressors amongst the hypocrites and idolaters are in enmity of Allah and His Messenger, and distance from the truth and guidance."
"At the same time those who have been given knowledge may know that this is the truth from your Lord, and come to believe in it, and their hearts become submissive to Him. Verily God guides those who believe, to the even path.",53,22,وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَتُخْبِتَ لَهُۥ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهَادِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"And so that those whom Allah gave knowledge are convinced that the Qur’ān revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the truth Allah revealed to you, O Messenger, thus increasing their faith in it and so that their hearts submit and humble themselves before it. Allah is the Guide of those who have faith toward the straight path of truth which contains no crookedness, as a reward for their submitting to it."
"The infidels will remain in doubt about it till the Hour overtakes them unawares, or the punishment of the barren day destructive should come upon them.",54,22,وَلَا يَزَالُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّنْهُ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَقِيمٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah and denied His Messenger will remain in doubt about the Qur’ān Allah revealed to you, continuing until the Hour comes to them suddenly whilst they are in that condition or the punishment of a day in which there is no mercy or good comes to them, and it is the Day of Judgment with respect to them."
The order will be God's on that Day; He will judge between them. Then those who had come to believe and done the right will be in gardens of delight.,55,22,ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فِى جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Supreme authority on the Day of Judgment - the day when the punishment these people have been promised shall come to them, will only be for Allah alone. He will have no competitor for it, and He will judge between the believers and the disbelievers. He will judge for each of them as they deserve: those who had faith and performed good deeds will be granted a great reward in eternal gardens of everlasting bounties."
"But those who did not believe and called Our revelations lies, will be given disgraceful punishment.",56,22,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,And those who disbelieved in Allah and rejected the signs He revealed unto His Messenger will face a humiliating punishment in hell.
"Those who left their homes in the way of God, and then were killed or died, will surely be given a better provision by God, for God is surely the best of providers.",57,22,وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُوٓا۟ أَوْ مَاتُوا۟ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ ٱللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"As for those who left their houses and homelands in honour of Allah’s religion and seeking His pleasure, and were killed whilst striving in His path or died, Allah shall grant them an everlasting sustenance in paradise. Indeed, Allah is the best of sustainers."
God will surely lead them to a place with which they will be gratified. Verily God is all-knowing and forbearing.,58,22,لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُم مُّدْخَلًا يَرْضَوْنَهُۥ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ,Allah will definitely enter them into a place they shall be pleased with. And Allah is well aware of their intentions and their deeds; forbearing in that He did not punish them hastily on their shortcomings.
"Whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him, and is wronged again, will certainly be helped by God. Verily God is forgiving and kind.",59,22,ذَٰلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِۦ ثُمَّ بُغِىَ عَلَيْهِ لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ,"The aforementioned, i.e. those who migrated in the path of Allah being entered into paradise, and permission for the wronged to avenge justly without incurring sin. If the oppressor returns to his oppression, Allah will help the oppressed. Indeed, Allah overlooks the sins of the believers and forgives them."
"That is so for God turns night into day and day into night, for God is all-hearing and all-seeing;",60,22,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُولِجُ ٱلَّيْلَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"The helping of the oppressed is because Allah is capable of doing as He wills. From His capabilities is entering the night into the day and the day into the night, by increasing one and decreasing the other. Allah also hears the statements of His servants and knows of their actions; nothing is hidden from Him and He shall requit them accordingly."
"That is so for God is the undeniable truth, and what they invoke apart from Him is false; yet God is all-high and supreme.",61,22,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ هُوَ ٱلْبَٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"The aforementioned, i.e. entering the night into the day and the day into the night, is because Allah is truly existent, and so His religion is the truth, His promise is also true and His helping the believers is also true. The idols that the idolaters worship instead of Allah are false and have no basis. And Allah is supreme over His creation in being, in power and in subjugation; the Grand to Whom belongs all majesty, grandeur and exaltedness."
Do you not see how God sends down water from the sky and in the morning the earth turns green? Truly God is benign and well-informed.,62,22,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَتُصْبِحُ ٱلْأَرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ,"O Messenger! Do you not see that Allah causes rain to fall from the sky, and consequently the earth becomes green owing to the vegetation that grows upon it after the rain has fallen? Allah is kind to His servants in that He makes the rain fall for them, and makes the earth grow crops. He is also well aware of their requirements; nothing is hidden from Him."
"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Surely God is all-sufficing, worthy of praise.",63,22,لَّهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,To Him alone belongs supreme authority of the heavens and the earth. He is The Self-sufficient who is never needy of any of His creation; the eternally existent.
"Do you not see God has harnessed all that is in the earth, to your service? And the boats ply in the ocean by His command. He holds the sky in position lest it should fall upon the earth save by His dispensation. Verily God is compassionate and kind to men.",64,22,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَيُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O Messenger! Do you not see that Allah has made the animals and other objects manageable for your needs and benefit, and the benefit of the masses? He also made manageable for you the ships that sail the oceans with His command; sailing from city to city. He also holds back the sky so it does not fall onto Earth except with His command; if He allowed it to fall it would. Indeed, Allah is benevolent and merciful towards the people such that He made these things manageable for them, despite their potential harm."
"It is He who gives you life, then makes you die; then He will bring you back to life again. Man is surely most ungrateful.",65,22,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَحْيَاكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَكَفُورٌ,"Allah is the only One Who gave you life, in that He gave you existence when you were non-existent. He will then cause death upon you when your lives expire, and then will revive you after your death to hold you to account for your deeds and requit you for them. Verily, the human is ever in denial of the bounties of Allah, despite their being so clear."
We have determined for each community a way of worship which they follow. So they should not contend with you in this matter; and you should go on calling them to your Lord. You are surely on the right path.,66,22,لِّكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ جَعَلْنَا مَنسَكًا هُمْ نَاسِكُوهُ فَلَا يُنَٰزِعُنَّكَ فِى ٱلْأَمْرِ وَٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ إِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"I have made a set of laws for the people of every creed. O Messenger! Let the idolaters and people of other creeds not contest with you in your set of laws, because you are more deserving of it than them as they are the people of falsehood. Invite the people towards sincerely proclaiming the oneness of Allah; indeed, you are on the straight path, in which there is no deviation."
"If they argue with you, tell them: ""God knows well what you are doing.",67,22,وَإِن جَٰدَلُوكَ فَقُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"If they insist on quarrelling with you after the evidence has become clear, leave their matter to Allah, warning them and saying: “Allah is most aware of the actions you do, none of your actions are hidden from Him, and He will requit you for them”."
"God will judge between you on the Day of Judgement in what you are at variance.""",68,22,ٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Allah will judge between His servants: the believers and the disbelievers from among them, on the Day of Judgment, in the matters of religion they would dispute over in the world."
Do you not know that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? This is surely in accordance with the law. This is certainly how (the law of) God works inevitably.,69,22,أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ فِى كِتَٰبٍ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"O Messenger! Do you not know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on Earth; nothing is hidden from Him, and His knowledge of it is recorded in the Preserved Tablet. Encompassing the knowledge of it all is very easy for Allah."
"Yet they worship in place of God that for which no authority has been sent to them, and of which they have no knowledge. The wicked will have none to help them.",70,22,وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِۦ سُلْطَٰنًا وَمَا لَيْسَ لَهُم بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ,The idolaters worship idols instead of Allah; idols which Allah did not reveal any proof of their worship being acceptable in His books. Neither do they have any proof of their own knowledge; their only object of reliance for that is blind following of their forefathers. The wrongdoers will have no helper that will protect them from the punishment of Allah that will fall upon them.
"When Our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers. They can hardly restrain themselves from attacking those who recite Our revelations. Tell them: ""Should I give you news of something worse than this?"" -- Hell, which God has promised the infidels. How evil a destination!",71,22,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِى وُجُوهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱلْمُنكَرَ يَكَادُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَعَدَهَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"When you recite My clear verses of the Qur’ān unto them, you will recognise the objecting frowns of the disbelievers when they hear them. It is as if they would violently assault those who recite My verses unto them in extreme anger. O Messenger! Say to them: “Shall I inform you of something which is worse than this anger and frowning of yours? It is the hellfire which Allah has promised to enter the disbelievers into. How terrible their abode is!”"
"O men, give ear to this parable: Those you worship other than God can never create as much as a fly, even if they get together to do so; and if the fly were to rob them of a thing they would not be able to snatch it away from it. How weak the seeker and how weak the sought!",72,22,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ضُرِبَ مَثَلٌ فَٱسْتَمِعُوا۟ لَهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا۟ ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ ٱجْتَمَعُوا۟ لَهُۥ وَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ ٱلذُّبَابُ شَيْـًٔا لَّا يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ ضَعُفَ ٱلطَّالِبُ وَٱلْمَطْلُوبُ,"O people! A parable is about to be narrated, so listen carefully and take lesson from it! Indeed, those idols and other things you worship instead of Allah cannot even create a fly despite its small size, because of their incompetence. Even if they were to convene in trying to do so they would not be able to achieve it. And if a fly was to take anything away from them, i.e. perfume etc. they would not have the power to reclaim it. By their incapability of creating a fly and reclaiming anything from it, their incapability of doing anything greater than that becomes evident. How can they then worship it instead of Allah? This seeker - which is the worshipped idol that is totally incapable of reclaiming whatever the fly has taken from it, together with the sought-after fly, are both weak."
They do not esteem God with the right estimation. God is surely all-powerful and all-mighty.,73,22,مَا قَدَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"They did not revere Allah as He deserves to be revered when they worshipped some of His creation along with worshipping Him. Indeed, Allah is the Strong, and He created the heavens, the earth and everything within them due to this strength and power. He is the Almighty who cannot be overpowered, unlike the idols of the idolaters which are weak and powerless to create anything."
God chooses messengers from the angels and human beings. Verily God is all-hearing and all-seeing.,74,22,ٱللَّهُ يَصْطَفِى مِنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ رُسُلًا وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"Allah, may He be glorified, selects messengers from the Angels and the people also. He sends some of the Angels to the prophets, like Gabriel, who He sent to the human messengers; and He also sends human messengers to common people. Indeed, Allah hears what the idolaters say regarding His messengers and is insightful of who He selects to convey His message."
"He knows what is before them and what lies behind them, and all things go back to God.",75,22,يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"Allah, may He be glorified, is well aware of the affairs of His messengers, from both the angels and the people, even before their creation and well after their death. To Him alone shall all matters return on the Day of Judgment, when He will resurrect His servants and requit them for the actions they sent forth."
"O you who believe, bow in adoration, Worship your Lord and do what is good that you may find success.",76,22,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱرْكَعُوا۟ وَٱسْجُدُوا۟ وَٱعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ وَٱفْعَلُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"O you who have believed in Allah and have acted in accordance to the laws He laid down for you! Bow and prostrate to Him alone in your prayer; do good by way of charity and enjoining family ties, in hope that you succeed in your objective and achieve salvation from the feared."
"Strive in the way of God with a service worthy of Him. He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham. He named you Muslim earlier, and in this (Qur'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind. So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God. He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!",77,22,وَجَٰهِدُوا۟ فِى ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِۦ هُوَ ٱجْتَبَىٰكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّىٰكُمُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَٰذَا لِيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ فَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱعْتَصِمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ هُوَ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ فَنِعْمَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ ٱلنَّصِيرُ,"And strive in the path of Allah sincerely for His pleasure. He has selected you and made your religion a religion of kindness, in which there is no oppression and extremism. This tolerant creed is the creed of your forefather Abraham (peace be upon him). Allah has named you ‘Muslims’ in the previous books and in the Qur’ān, so that the Messenger can be a witness against you in that he conveyed the message he was commanded to convey, and so that you yourselves can be witnesses against the previous nations in that their messengers also conveyed their messages respectively. So show gratitude to Allah upon that by performing prayer as perfectly as possible, giving Zakat from your wealth, seeking refuge in Allah and relying upon Him in all your matters, for He is the best protector for those believers who seek His protection, and the best of helpers for those of them who seek His help. So seek His protection, He will protect you, and seek His help, He will help you."
"THE TRUE BELIEVERS will be successful,",0,23,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ قَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"Those who believed in Allah and acted according to His laws have indeed succeeded by achieving whatever they sought, and gaining salvation from whatever they feared."
"Who are humble in their service,",1,23,ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلَاتِهِمْ خَٰشِعُونَ,Those who were humble in their prayer: their limbs remained calm during it and their hearts were free of distractions.
"Who shun all frivolities,",2,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ ٱللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ,"Those who turned away from falsehood and futility, especially those futile actions and speech which was sinful."
Who strive for betterment;,3,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَوٰةِ فَٰعِلُونَ,"Those who purified themselves of evil characteristics, and their wealth by taking out Zakat from it."
Who guard their sex,4,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَٰفِظُونَ,"Those who safeguarded their private parts by keeping them far from fornication, homosexuality and shameful actions; so they remained pure and chaste."
"Except from their wives and women slaves of old are free of blame,",5,23,إِلَّا عَلَىٰٓ أَزْوَٰجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ,"Except using them with their wives or the female servants they possessed, for they are blameless in taking pleasure from them through sexual intercourse and the like."
But those who covet more than this will be transgressors;,6,23,فَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَىٰ وَرَآءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْعَادُونَ,"So whosoever seeks pleasure from other than his wives and female servants that he possesses, he is transgressing the limits of Allah by delving into that which Allah has forbidden, without keeping to that which He has kept lawful."
And those who fulfil their trusts and keep their promises;,7,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَٰنَٰتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَٰعُونَ,"Those who fulfil and do not neglect or usurp the trusts Allah has entrusted them with, or any of His servants have entrusted them with. Rather, they keep to their pacts."
And those who are watchful of their acts of prayer.,8,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَٰتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ,"Those who observe their prayers by being punctual in them, by performing them at their correct times together, obligations and preferred actions."
"These are the real gainers,",9,23,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْوَٰرِثُونَ,Those possessing these characteristics are the true inheritors.
"Who will inherit Paradise, and live in it for ever.",10,23,ٱلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ ٱلْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,They will inherit the loftiest level of paradise wherein they will live forever. Their bounties will not finish in it.
"We created man from the finest extract of clay,",11,23,وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن سُلَٰلَةٍ مِّن طِينٍ,"Verily, I created the father of mankind, Adam, from clay. I took the soil he was created from, from a mixture of water and the soil of the earth."
Then We placed him as a sperm in a firmly established lodging;,12,23,ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَٰهُ نُطْفَةً فِى قَرَارٍ مَّكِينٍ,"Then I created his progeny who procreate, by way of a drop of sperm that lodges in the womb until birth."
"Then We fashioned the sperm into an embryo, then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh; then from the lump of flesh We fashioned bones, then clothed the bones with flesh. Thus We formed him into a new creation. So blessed be God the best of Creators.",13,23,ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا ٱلنُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا ٱلْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً فَخَلَقْنَا ٱلْمُضْغَةَ عِظَٰمًا فَكَسَوْنَا ٱلْعِظَٰمَ لَحْمًا ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَٰهُ خَلْقًا ءَاخَرَ فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَٰلِقِينَ,"I then created the lodged drop of sperm into a red clot of blood, which I then created into a piece of flesh, which I then created into hard bones. I then covered those bones with flesh and then developed it into a completely different creation, by blowing a soul into it and bringing it out into life. Praised is Allah, the best of creators!"
"And then you will certainly die,",14,23,ثُمَّ إِنَّكُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ,"O people! After having passed through all these phases, you shall die when your lives expire."
Then will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection.,15,23,ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ,"Then, after your death, you shall be resurrected from your graves on the Day of Judgment so that you may be held to account for whatever deeds you sent forth."
We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation.,16,23,وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعَ طَرَآئِقَ وَمَا كُنَّا عَنِ ٱلْخَلْقِ غَٰفِلِينَ,"O people! Verily, I created seven heavens over you, one above the other. I am never neglectful of My creation, nor am I One to forget it."
"We send down water from the sky in determined measure, and store it up in the earth; and We have power to drain it away.",17,23,وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۢ بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّٰهُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍۭ بِهِۦ لَقَٰدِرُونَ,"I sent down rain from the heavens according to the need toward it; not in excessive amounts that cause ruin, nor too little that is insufficient. I allow it to settle on earth so that the people and animals can take benefit from it. Otherwise, I am capable of causing it to wash away, in which case they would not be able to benefit from it."
"We grow orchards of dates and grapes from it for you, Which yield fruits in abundance that you eat.",18,23,فَأَنشَأْنَا لَكُم بِهِۦ جَنَّٰتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَٰبٍ لَّكُمْ فِيهَا فَوَٰكِهُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"Through that water I then created gardens for you, the like of palms and grapevines. You have fruits of varying colours and appearance that grow within them, like figs, pomegranates and apples, of which you eat."
The tree that grows on Mount Sinai yields oil and seasoning for those who eat.,19,23,وَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ تَنۢبُتُ بِٱلدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلْءَاكِلِينَ,"Through that water, I also created the olive tree for you, the origins of which come from the land of Mount Sinai. From its fruits, the oil is extracted which you use and consume."
"There are lessons for you in the cattle from whose bellies We give you milk to drink, and there are other advantages that you derive from them, and some of them you eat;",20,23,وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُم مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَٰفِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"O people! Indeed, you have a lesson to take from grazing livestock (camels, cows and sheep), in that you can draw conclusions from them in the power of Allah and His kindness to you. He quenches your thirst with pure, tasty milk from the bellies of these animals. You can also derive other benefits from them, like conveyance, wool, fur, bristles, together with being able to consume their meat."
And you are carried on them and on boats.,21,23,وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ,You are carried on the camels on land and on the ships at sea.
"We sent Noah to his people. He said: ""O my people, worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed for yourselves?""",22,23,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ فَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"Indeed, I sent Noah (peace be upon him) to his people to call them towards Allah, so he said to them, “O my people! Worship Allah only; you do not have any true deity except Him, may He be glorified. Will you not be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions?”"
"The chiefs of his people, who did not believe, said: ""He is only a man like you. He wishes to acquire ascendancy over you. If God had willed He would have sent down angels. We never heard this from our elders.",23,23,فَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَؤُا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَأَنزَلَ مَلَٰٓئِكَةً مَّا سَمِعْنَا بِهَٰذَا فِىٓ ءَابَآئِنَا ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"So the noblemen and leaders from his people who disbelieved in Allah said to their followers and the masses, “This man that claims to be a messenger is only a human like yourselves; he only desires leadership and rule over you. If Allah wished to send a messenger to you He would have done so by sending one from the angels, not from the humans. We have not heard anything like what he is claiming from our predecessors!”"
"He is only a man possessed; so wait and watch him for a time.""",24,23,إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا رَجُلٌۢ بِهِۦ جِنَّةٌ فَتَرَبَّصُوا۟ بِهِۦ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,He is only a man who is mad. He does not understand what he himself is saying. Wait and see when soon his true reality becomes apparent to the people.
"""O my Lord,"" prayed (Noah), ""help me against them, for they accuse me of lies.""",25,23,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنصُرْنِى بِمَا كَذَّبُونِ,"Noah (peace be upon him) said, “O my Lord! Help me against them and pay them back for their rejection and defiance!”"
"So We asked him to build the ark under Our eyes and guidance, (and said): ""When Our command is issued and the source of water boils over, put a pair of every species in it, and your family except those for whom Our sentence has been passed already; and do not speak to Me for those who are wicked: They will be drowned.",26,23,فَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ أَنِ ٱصْنَعِ ٱلْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ ٱلتَّنُّورُ فَٱسْلُكْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلَّا مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَوْلُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَا تُخَٰطِبْنِى فِى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ إِنَّهُم مُّغْرَقُونَ,"So I revealed to him: Make a ship under My supervision and tutorage. Then, when My command to destroy them is issued and water gushes forth from the place where bread is baked, start taking a male and female from every living species onto the ship, so that they can procreate and not become extinct. Also take your family on board, except for those upon whom Allah’s decree of destruction has been passed i.e. your wife and son. Do not request Me to save and not destroy those who have wronged through disbelief; there is no doubt they shall be destroyed by drowning in the water of the flood."
"When you and those with you have boarded the ark, say: 'All praise be to God who has delivered us from the people who were sinful.'",27,23,فَإِذَا ٱسْتَوَيْتَ أَنتَ وَمَن مَّعَكَ عَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ فَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى نَجَّىٰنَا مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"When you board the ship together with the believers achieving salvation, say: “All praise is for Allah Who saved us from the disbelieving people and destroyed them.”"
"And say: 'O Lord, disembark me in a welcome place; You are the best of deliverers.'",28,23,وَقُل رَّبِّ أَنزِلْنِى مُنزَلًا مُّبَارَكًا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْمُنزِلِينَ,"And say: “O my Lord! Cause me to disembark at a blessed place, for You are the best of those who cause to disembark.”"
There were surely signs in this; We will surely put you to the test.,29,23,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ وَإِن كُنَّا لَمُبْتَلِينَ,"Indeed, in the aforementioned, i.e. saving Noah and the believers with him, and destroying the disbelievers, are great signs of My ability to help My messengers and destroy their rejecters. I had tested the people of Noah by sending him to them, so that the believers and disbelievers, the obedient and sinners become distinct."
After them We raised a new generation.,30,23,ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْنًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"Thereafter, I created a different generation of people after destroying the people of Noah. They were the Ād, the people of Hud (peace be upon him)."
"Then We sent to them an apostle from among them (who said): ""Worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed and fear God?""",31,23,فَأَرْسَلْنَا فِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْهُمْ أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"I sent to them a messenger from amongst them: Hud, who would call them towards Allah. He said to them, “O my people! Worship Allah only; you do not have any true deity except Him, may He be glorified. Will you not be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions?”"
"The chiefs of the people who did not believe and denied the life to come, though We had given them good things of this life to enjoy, (said): ""He is only a mortal like you. He eats as you do, and drinks as you drink.",32,23,وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِلِقَآءِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأَتْرَفْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يَأْكُلُ مِمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ مِنْهُ وَيَشْرَبُ مِمَّا تَشْرَبُونَ,"The noblemen and leaders from his people who disbelieved in Allah, rejected the Hereafter and the punishment and reward to be meted out in it, and were misled by the blessings I had granted them in the world, said to their followers and masses, “This is a human just like you are: he eats of the food you eat and drinks of the drinks you drink. He does not have any superiority over you such that he would be sent as a messenger to you!”"
So if you follow a man like yourself you will certainly be doomed.,33,23,وَلَئِنْ أَطَعْتُم بَشَرًا مِّثْلَكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا لَّخَٰسِرُونَ,"“And if you were to follow a human just like you, you would indeed have been deceived into leaving aside your deities and following one who has no virtue over you.”"
"Does he give you a promise that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones, you will be raised to life again?",34,23,أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَابًا وَعِظَٰمًا أَنَّكُم مُّخْرَجُونَ,"“Does this man who claims to be a messenger promise you that when you die and become dust and decomposed bones, that you shall leave your graves alive? Is this even conceivable?!”"
How far-fetched what you are promised;,35,23,هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ,"The promise you are being given in being taken out of your graves alive after you have died and turned into dust and decomposed bones, is very far from reality."
There is only the life of this world: We die and we live: there is no rising from the dead for us.,36,23,إِنْ هِىَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ,"The only life is the life of this world, not the afterlife. The living from among us die and are not revived, whilst others are born and live. We are not going to be taken out after we have died, to be taken to account on the Day of Judgment."
"He is just a man who invents a lie about God; we cannot believe in him.""",37,23,إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا رَجُلٌ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا وَمَا نَحْنُ لَهُۥ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Hud, who claims he is a messenger, has only fabricated a lie unto Allah by this claim of his; we are not going to believe him."
"(The apostle prayed): ""O Lord, deliver me, for they accuse me of lies.""",38,23,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنصُرْنِى بِمَا كَذَّبُونِ,"Hud said, “O my Lord! Help me against them and pay them back for their rejection and defiance!”"
"Answered (the Lord): ""They shall wake up repenting soon.""",39,23,قَالَ عَمَّا قَلِيلٍ لَّيُصْبِحُنَّ نَٰدِمِينَ,"Allah responded to him, saying, “Very soon, these people who have rejected the message you have brought to them will regret their rejection.”"
So they were rightly seized by a mighty blast; and We turned them into mouldy rubbish: A good riddance of the wicked people!,40,23,فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ غُثَآءً فَبُعْدًا لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"So a severe scream, accompanied by a severe wind, took them by surprise, due to their deserving the punishment owing to their stubbornness. I destroyed them, leaving them like the froth of the flood. Woe be to the transgressing nation!"
Then after them We raised other generations.,41,23,ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُونًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"Then, after destroying them, I created other peoples and nations, like the nation of Lot, Shu‘ayb and Jonah."
"No nation can live beyond its allotted time, or lag behind.",42,23,مَا تَسْبِقُ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ,"None of these rejecting nations will precede the time fixed for their destruction, nor will they be delayed from it, regardless of whatever means they have at their disposal."
"Then We sent Our apostles one after the other. Every time an apostle came to a people they denied him. So We made one follow the other (to its doom), and turned them into bygone tales. Cursed be the people who do not believe!",43,23,ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَا كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ فَأَتْبَعْنَا بَعْضَهُم بَعْضًا وَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ فَبُعْدًا لِّقَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"I then sent My messengers in succession, one after the other. Each time the Messenger came to his nation he was sent to they rejected him, so I successively destroyed them, leaving nothing except for the tales of people regarding them. So destruction be to the nation that does not believe in the message brought to it by a messenger sent to it!"
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our miracles and clear proofs,44,23,ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَأَخَاهُ هَٰرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"I then sent Moses and his brother Aaron with nine of My signs: the Staff, the Hand, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, floods, drought and shortage of produce, and with clear proof."
"To Pharaoh and his nobles who behaved with arrogance, for they were a conceited lot,",45,23,إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا عَالِينَ,"I sent them both to Pharaoh and the noblemen of his people, but they displayed arrogance and did not submit to believing in them. They were a people who imposed themselves upon people by subduing and oppressing them."
"And said: ""Should we believe in two men like yourselves, whose people are our subjects?""",46,23,فَقَالُوٓا۟ أَنُؤْمِنُ لِبَشَرَيْنِ مِثْلِنَا وَقَوْمُهُمَا لَنَا عَٰبِدُونَ,"So they said, “Should we believe two humans like us, who have no superiority over us and their tribe (the Israelites) are submissive and obedient to us?”"
"Then they accused them of lies, and joined the company of those who were destroyed.",47,23,فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْلَكِينَ,"So they rejected whatever message they brought to them from Allah. And because of their rejection, they were destroyed by drowning."
And We gave the Book to Moses so that they may be guided.,48,23,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,"Verily, I gave Moses the Torah in the hope that his people would be guided to the truth through it and implement its teachings."
"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on an elevated ground, sequestered, watered by a spring.",49,23,وَجَعَلْنَا ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُۥٓ ءَايَةً وَءَاوَيْنَٰهُمَآ إِلَىٰ رَبْوَةٍ ذَاتِ قَرَارٍ وَمَعِينٍ,"I also made Jesus and his mother Mary signs indicating My capability; she conceived him without a father. I granted them shelter in an elevated place on earth, an even, habitable place which had fresh flowing water."
"O you apostles, eat things that are clean, and do things that are good. We are surely cognisant of what you do.",50,23,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرُّسُلُ كُلُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ وَٱعْمَلُوا۟ صَٰلِحًا إِنِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"O Messengers! Eat from the appealing food that I have made lawful for you, and perform good deeds in accordance to the laws of Allah. Indeed, I am ever aware of every action of yours; none of your actions are hidden from Me."
"Verily this your order is one order, and I am your Lord, so fear Me.",51,23,وَإِنَّ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَأَنَا۠ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"O Messengers! Indeed, your creed is one creed: it is Islam. And I am your Lord, you do not have a Lord other than Me, so be mindful of Me by fulfilling My commands and refraining from My prohibitions."
"But then they divided up their order into different creeds, each section rejoicing in what it had come to have.",52,23,فَتَقَطَّعُوٓا۟ أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا كُلُّ حِزْبٍۭ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ,"After they passed away, their followers were divided in religion and became sects and groups, with each group conceited in believing that whatever it believed in was the true acceptable religion according to Allah, disregarding the views of anyone else."
So leave them to their ignorance for a time.,53,23,فَذَرْهُمْ فِى غَمْرَتِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,"O Messenger! Leave them in the ignorance and confusion they are in, until the punishment descends upon them."
Do they think that by increasing their wealth and children,54,23,أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُم بِهِۦ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ,"Do these self-conceited groups think that whatever wealth and offspring we bestow them with in the world, is a prelude of good they deserve? It is not as they think; I am only giving it to them as respite, gradually leading them into destruction, but they do not realise it."
We are hastening to reward them for good deeds? No. They do not comprehend.,55,23,نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ بَل لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ,"Do these self-conceited groups think that whatever wealth and offspring we bestow them with in the world, is a prelude of good they deserve? It is not as they think; I am only giving it to them as respite, gradually leading them into destruction, but they do not realise it."
"Surely those who live in awe of their Lord,",56,23,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ رَبِّهِم مُّشْفِقُونَ,"Indeed, those who, despite their belief and good, are fearful of their Lord."
"Who believe in their Lord's revelations,",57,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And those who believe in the universal and religious signs of their Lord.
"Who do not associate any one with their Lord,",58,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِرَبِّهِمْ لَا يُشْرِكُونَ,"And those who proclaim the oneness of their Lord, without ascribing anything to Him as partner."
"Who give whatsoever they give (in His way), and their hearts tremble with fear that they have to go back to their Lord,",59,23,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ ءَاتَوا۟ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ رَٰجِعُونَ,"Those who strive in doing righteous deeds and draw closer to Allah through them, whilst fearing that He may not accept their spending in His path, or good deeds when they return to Him on the Day of Judgment."
Are the ones who hasten to goodness and outpace the others.,60,23,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ وَهُمْ لَهَا سَٰبِقُونَ,"Those possessing these lofty characteristics hasten towards good deeds, and beat others in performing them. That is why they surpass everyone else."
"We do not burden a soul beyond capacity, for We have a record that tells the truth. No wrong will be done to any one.",61,23,وَلَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا وَلَدَيْنَا كِتَٰبٌ يَنطِقُ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,I do not burden any soul except with whatever actions are within its capability. I have a book in which I have recorded all the deeds of every doer; it shows the undisputable truth. The people will not be wronged by having their good deeds decreased or evil deeds increased.
"Yet their hearts are oblivious of this; and besides, they are busy with other things,",62,23,بَلْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فِى غَمْرَةٍ مِّنْ هَٰذَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْمَٰلٌ مِّن دُونِ ذَٰلِكَ هُمْ لَهَا عَٰمِلُونَ,"Rather, the hearts of the disbelievers are neglectful of this book that contains the truth, and of the book that was revealed to them. They also commit evil actions other than the disbelief that they are insistent on."
"So that when We seize the affluent among them with affliction, they will begin to implore for help.",63,23,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَخَذْنَا مُتْرَفِيهِم بِٱلْعَذَابِ إِذَا هُمْ يَجْـَٔرُونَ,"Until when I punish those among them who lived in luxury in the world with the punishment on the Day of Judgment, they shall raise their voices calling out for help."
"""Do not supplicate for help today; you will not be rescued by Us;",64,23,لَا تَجْـَٔرُوا۟ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّكُم مِّنَّا لَا تُنصَرُونَ,"It will be said to them, depriving them of all hope in the mercy of Allah, “Do not scream and do not call for help today! There is no helper for you today who can help you against the punishment of Allah."
"For when My revelations were read out to you, you turned back on your heels and fled",65,23,قَدْ كَانَتْ ءَايَٰتِى تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَعْقَٰبِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ,"Verily, the verses of Allah would be recited to you in the world, but you would turn away from them when you heard them, in hatred for them."
"Insolently, treating them like tales told at night.""",66,23,مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِۦ سَٰمِرًا تَهْجُرُونَ,"You did that displaying arrogance over the people, because you thought you were the people of the sanctuary while you were not; the true people of the sanctuary are the Mindful. You also talked ill of it by night and would not deem it sacred."
Why did they not think over the message? Or has something come to them which had not come to their fathers?,67,23,أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا۟ ٱلْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَآءَهُم مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ ءَابَآءَهُمُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"Will these idolaters not ponder over the Qur’ān Allah has revealed, bring faith in it and implement its teachings? Or is it that something has come to them which did not come to their predecessors, so they turned away from it and rejected it?"
"Or did they not recognise their apostle, and rejected him?",68,23,أَمْ لَمْ يَعْرِفُوا۟ رَسُولَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَهُۥ مُنكِرُونَ,"Or is it that they do not recognise Muhammad peace be upon him whom Allah has sent to them, and so they reject him? Verily, they recognise him, his truthfulness and his honesty."
"Or do they say that he is possessed? In fact, he has brought the truth to them, but most of them abhor the truth.",69,23,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ بِهِۦ جِنَّةٌۢ بَلْ جَآءَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَٰرِهُونَ,"Rather, do they say, “He is insane!”? Surely, they have lied. Rather, the truth has come to them, undisputably from Allah. The majority of them dislike the truth, hating it due to the jealousy within themselves and fanaticism over their falsehood."
"Had truth been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved. In fact We had sent them their reminder, but they turned away from good advice.",70,23,وَلَوِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ بَلْ أَتَيْنَٰهُم بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَن ذِكْرِهِم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"If Allah was to have let matters run and arrange them in accordance to their desires, the heavens, earth and all their inhabitants would fall into ruin due to their ignorance of the outcome of matters, and their inability to differentiate between good and bad plans."
"Or do you ask of them any tribute? In that case the tribute of your Lord is better, for He is the best of providers.",71,23,أَمْ تَسْـَٔلُهُمْ خَرْجًا فَخَرَاجُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"O Messenger! Have you asked for a fee from these people for what you brought to them, which has made them reject your call? You have not done as such; the reward of your Lord is far better than the reward any of these people can give. He, may He be glorified, is the best of providers."
You are surely calling them to the right path.,72,23,وَإِنَّكَ لَتَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"O Messenger! Indeed, you call these people and others towards a straight path which has no deviation: it is the path of Islam."
But those who believe not in the Hereafter turn away from the straight path.,73,23,وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَنِ ٱلصِّرَٰطِ لَنَٰكِبُونَ,"And indeed those who do not believe in the Hearafter; accountability, punishment and reward, incline towards other paths which lead to the hellfire."
"If We took compassion on them and removed the affliction they are in, they would only wander lost in confusion.",74,23,وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَٰهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِم مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّوا۟ فِى طُغْيَٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"If I were to have mercy on them and lift their famine and hunger, they would continue being misguided from the truth, being confused and stumbling."
"We had seized them with the punishment, but they did not bow before their Lord nor turned to Him in humility,",75,23,وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَٰهُم بِٱلْعَذَابِ فَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُوا۟ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,"I tested them through different afflictions, but neither did they humble before their Lord or submit to Him nor did they pray to Him submissively so that He lifts the afflictions from them when they befall."
So that when at last We open up the gate of severe punishment on them they will be overwhelmed with despair.,76,23,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا ذَا عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ إِذَا هُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ,"Until when I opened a door of severe punishment on them, they became hopeless of every ease and good."
"It is He who gave you hearing, sight, and hearts, but only few of you give thanks.",77,23,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنشَأَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,"O deniers of the resurrection, Allah is the One Who created for you hearing to listen with, vision to see with, and hearts to ponder with, but despite that, you do not thank Him for these favours except a little."
"It is He who multiplied you on the earth, and it will be before Him that you will be gathered.",78,23,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"O people, it is He Who created you on earth, and to Him alone you will be raised for reckoning and reward on the Day of Judgment."
"It is He who gives you life and death, and His the alternation of night and day. Even then you do not understand,",79,23,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَلَهُ ٱخْتِلَٰفُ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"And it is He alone Who gives life; there is nobody who gives life besides Him. And it is He alone Who gives death; there is nobody who gives death besides Him. To Him alone belongs fixing the difference of night and day, in terms of darkness and light, and length and shortness. Do you not understand His power and His being alone in creating and managing?"
And talk as did the people of old.,80,23,بَلْ قَالُوا۟ مِثْلَ مَا قَالَ ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ,But they said what their forefathers and predecessors in disbelief said.
"They say: ""When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we be raised to life again?",81,23,قَالُوٓا۟ أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَٰمًا أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ,"They said, unbelievingly and denyingly: “When we die and turn into dust and decomposed bones, will we be raised alive to be reckoned?"
"We and our fathers were promised this before; it is nothing but ancient lore!""",82,23,لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا نَحْنُ وَءَابَآؤُنَا هَٰذَا مِن قَبْلُ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"We were promised this, i.e. resurrection after death, and so were our predecessors promised this before, but we did not see this promise fulfilled. These are only the false tales and lies of the previous people”."
"Say: ""To whom does the earth and whosoever is upon it then belong, if you know?""",83,23,قُل لِّمَنِ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, say to these disbelievers who deny the resurrection: “Who does this earth and those on it belong to, if you have any knowledge?”"
"They will say: ""To God."" Say: ""Then why do you not bethink yourselves?""",84,23,سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"They will say: “The earth and all upon it belong to Allah”, so say to them: “Do you not then remember that the One to Whom belong the earth and all upon it has the power to restore you to life after you die?”"
"Say: ""Then who is the Lord of the seven skies? And who is the Lord of the mighty Throne?""",85,23,قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱلسَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"Say to them: “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and who is the Lord of the Great Throne, besides which there is no bigger creation?”"
"They will say: ""God."" Say: ""Then why do you not obey and fear Him?""",86,23,سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"They will say: “The seven heavens and the Great Throne are the property of Allah”, so say to them: “Will you not then by mindful of Allah by carrying out His orders and refraining from His prohibitions, so that you are saved from His punishment?”"
"Say: ""Whose is the sovereignty over all things, who protects, and against whom there is no protection? {Answer) if you have knowledge.""",87,23,قُلْ مَنۢ بِيَدِهِۦ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ يُجِيرُ وَلَا يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Say to them: “Who is the One in whose hand is the realm of everything, with nothing escaping His realm, Who helps whom He wants from His servants, with nobody being able to protect whom He intends bad for so as to remove punishment from Him, if you have any knowledge?”"
"They will say: ""God's."" Say: ""Then why are you so deluded?""",88,23,سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ فَأَنَّىٰ تُسْحَرُونَ,"They will say: “In Allah's hands belong all things”, so say to them: “So how do you lose your senses and worship others besides Him, whilst you profess to that?”"
"In fact We have sent the truth to them, but they are liars.",89,23,بَلْ أَتَيْنَٰهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"The matter is not as they claim. But rather, I have brought them the truth in which there is no doubt. They are lying in their claiming a partner and child for Allah. Allah is far above what they say."
"God has not begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Had this been so, each god would have taken away what he had created with him, and some would have risen over the others. God is much too glorious for what they attribute (to Him)!",90,23,مَا ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِن وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُۥ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِذًا لَّذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَٰهٍۭ بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"Allah has not taken a child as the disbelievers claim, nor is there any true deity alongside Him. If there were to be any true deity alongside Him, every deity would take his share of the creation he made and they would dominate one another, causing the order of the Universe to become corrupt. The reality is that none of this has occurred, proving that the true deity is Allah alone. He is pure and holy of what the idolaters describe Him with, namely partners and children which are unbefitting for Him."
"The knower of the absent and the present, too exalted is He for what they associate (with Him)!",91,23,عَٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,He is Knowing of everything hidden from His creation and Knowing of everything which can be seen and perceived through the senses. None of this is hidden from Him. Allah is above having a partner.
"Say: ""O Lord, if I am made to see what has been promised them,",92,23,قُل رَّبِّ إِمَّا تُرِيَنِّى مَا يُوعَدُونَ,"O Messenger, say: “O Lord, if you show me regarding these idolaters the punishment You have promised them."
"Then do not, O Lord, put me among the sinners.""",93,23,رَبِّ فَلَا تَجْعَلْنِى فِى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Lord, if You punish them and I am witnessing that, do not make me amongst them so that I would be afflicted with the punishment that afflicts them”."
We have certainly the power to make you see what We have promised them.,94,23,وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰٓ أَن نُّرِيَكَ مَا نَعِدُهُمْ لَقَٰدِرُونَ,I have power to make you witness and see the punishment I am promising them. I am not powerless to do this or anything else.
Dispel evil with what is good. We know well what they attribute (to Us).,95,23,ٱدْفَعْ بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ,"O Messenger, repel the one who is bad to you by the characteristic which is better, namely turning away from him and being patient with his harm. I know best the associating partners and denial they describe, and the unbefitting things they describe you with such as magic and insanity."
"Say: ""My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the evil promptings of the devils.",96,23,وَقُل رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَٰتِ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينِ,"And say: “O Lord, I seek protection in You against the evil suggestions of the satans and their whisperings."
"I seek refuge in You lest they come to me.""",97,23,وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ,And I seek refuge in You that they should be present with me in any of my affairs”.
"(But the unbelievers will persist) until when death comes to one of them he will say: ""O Lord, send me back again",98,23,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ٱرْجِعُونِ,"Until when death comes to one of these idolaters and he sees what is going to befall him, he says regretfully over his life that has escaped him and his deficiency regarding Allah: “O Lord, return me to the worldly life."
"That I may do some good I did not do (in the world)."" Not so. These are only words he utters. Behind them lies the intervening barrier (stretching) to the day of their resurrection.",99,23,لَعَلِّىٓ أَعْمَلُ صَٰلِحًا فِيمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّآ إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَآئِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَآئِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,"Perhaps I will do good actions when I return to it. Never. The matter is not as you requested. It is only a statement he is uttering. If he were to return to the worldly life, he would not fulfil what he promised. These people who have died will remain in a barrier between the world and the afterlife until the Day of Resurrection and rising. Thus, they will not return from it to the world, to make up for what they lost and to correct what they spoiled."
"When the trumpet blast is sounded no ties of lineage will hold among them, nor will they ask after one another.",100,23,فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَلَآ أَنسَابَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلَا يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"Then when the angel appointed to blow the Trumpet will blow the second time which will announce the Day of Judgment, there will be no relations between them to boast through, due to their being engrossed in the horrors of the Hearafter, and they will not question one another due to their being engrossed in what concerns them."
Only those whose scales are heavier in the balance will find happiness.,101,23,فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"So whoever’s scales are heavy because of his good actions outweighing his bad actions, those are the successful ones, by attaining their objective and being saved from their fears."
But those whose scales are lighter will perish and abide in Hell for ever.,102,23,وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فِى جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدُونَ,"And whoever’s scales are light because of his bad deeds outweighing his good deeds, those are the ones who have wasted themselves by doing that which is harmful to them, i.e., disbelief and sins, and leaving faith and good actions that were beneficial for them. They will be in the fire of hell forever and will not come out of it."
"Their faces will be scorched by flames, and they will grin and scowl within it.",103,23,تَلْفَحُ وُجُوهَهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَهُمْ فِيهَا كَٰلِحُونَ,"The fire will burn their faces. Therein, their top and bottom lips will shrink away from their teeth, due to severe frowning."
"""Were not My messages read out to you? But you denied them.""",104,23,أَلَمْ تَكُنْ ءَايَٰتِى تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,It will be said to rebuke them: “Were the verses of the Qur’ān not recited to you in the world but you used to deny them?”
"They will say: ""O Lord, our misery overwhelmed us, so we remained a people astray.",105,23,قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْمًا ضَآلِّينَ,"They will say: “Our Lord, our wretchedness which had already passed in Your knowledge overcame us, and we were a people astray from the truth."
"Get us out of this, O Lord. If we transgress we will surely be sinful.""",106,23,رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَٰلِمُونَ,"Our Lord, take us out of the fire. If we return to the disbelief and misguidance we were upon, we will surely have wronged ourselves and our excuse will be broken”."
"He will say: ""Remain condemned in it, and do not speak to Me.",107,23,قَالَ ٱخْسَـُٔوا۟ فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ,Allah will say: “Sit in the fire and stay in there disgraced; never speak to me.
"There was a section among My creatures that said: 'O Lord, we believe. Forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of the merciful.'",108,23,إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِى يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"There was a group of My servants who believed in Me, saying: ‘Our Lord, we have believed in You, so forgive our sins and grant us Your mercy, and You are the best of those who show mercy’"
But you ridiculed them. So much so that out of (spite) for them you forgot to remember Me and laughed at them.,109,23,فَٱتَّخَذْتُمُوهُمْ سِخْرِيًّا حَتَّىٰٓ أَنسَوْكُمْ ذِكْرِى وَكُنتُم مِّنْهُمْ تَضْحَكُونَ,"You took these believers who called upon their Lord as a joke, mocking them and making fun of them, until being engrossed in mocking them made you forget Allah’s remembrance and you used to laugh at them, jokingly and mockingly."
"I have rewarded them this day for they were constant, and they have come to attainment.""",110,23,إِنِّى جَزَيْتُهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا صَبَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,"I rewarded these believers with success through paradise on the Day of Judgment, due to their patience on Allah’s obedience and the harm they used to receive from you”."
"They will be asked: ""How long did you live on the earth in terms of years?""",111,23,قَٰلَ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ عَدَدَ سِنِينَ,He will say: “How many years did you spend on earth? And how much time did you waste therein?”
"They will say: ""A day or less than a day. Ask the enumerators of numbers.""",112,23,قَالُوا۟ لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ فَسْـَٔلِ ٱلْعَآدِّينَ,"They will reply by saying: “We stayed for one day or part of a day, so ask those who pay attention to counting days and months”."
"He will say: ""You stayed there only a moment, if you knew.",113,23,قَٰلَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا لَّوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"He will say: “You only stayed in the world for a short period, in which it was easy to persevere upon obedience, if only you knew the length of your stay”."
"Do you think We created you for nothing, and that you will not return to Us?""",114,23,أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ,"So do you think, O people, that I created you as a plaything without any wisdom, so that there will be no reward or punishment as with animals, and that you will not return to Me on the Day of Judgment for the reckoning and recompense?”"
"Exalted then be God, the King, the Real. There is no god but He, the Lord of the glorious throne.",115,23,فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ,"So pure is Allah, the King, who does as He wishes with His creation, and Who Himself is True, His promise is true and His saying is true. There is no true deity besides Him, Lord of the Noble Throne which is the biggest creation. He Who is Lord of the biggest creation is Lord of all the creation."
"Whoever worships another god apart from God, for which he holds no proof, will have to account for it before his Lord. Verily the unbelievers will not prosper.",116,23,وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ لَا بُرْهَٰنَ لَهُۥ بِهِۦ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"Whoever calls upon another god besides Allah for which he has no proof (and this is the case with every god besides Allah), the reward of his bad action is with his Lord, as He is the One Who will reward him for it by punishing him. The disbelievers will not be successful in attaining what they desire and being saved from their fears."
"Say: ""My Lord, forgive and have mercy. You are the best of the merciful.""",117,23,وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ وَٱرْحَمْ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰحِمِينَ,"Say - O Messenger: “O Lord, forgive my sins, grant me Your mercy, and You are the best of those who show mercy”."
WE HAVE REVEALED this Surah and made it obligatory as We have sent down clear injunctions in it that you may be warned.,0,24,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سُورَةٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهَا وَفَرَضْنَٰهَا وَأَنزَلْنَا فِيهَآ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"This is a sūrah I revealed, made acting upon its rulings necessary and in which I revealed clear verses, in the hope that you will be reminded of the rulings it contains and then practice them."
"The adulteress and adulterer should be flogged a hundred lashes each, and no pity for them should deter you from the law of God, if you believe in God and the Last Day; and the punishment should be witnessed by a body of believers.",1,24,ٱلزَّانِيَةُ وَٱلزَّانِى فَٱجْلِدُوا۟ كُلَّ وَٰحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا مِا۟ئَةَ جَلْدَةٍ وَلَا تَأْخُذْكُم بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The unmarried fornicating man and woman - flog each one of them with a hundred lashes, and no softness or mercy should affect you, whereby you do not establish the fixed punishment upon them or you make it lighter for them, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And a group of believers should be present when the fixed punishment is being executed on them, to go to the limit of publicising their crime, and to deter them and others."
"The adulterer can marry no one but an adulteress or his partner (in the act), and the adulteress cannot marry any but an adulterer or her partner (in the act). This is forbidden the believers,",2,24,ٱلزَّانِى لَا يَنكِحُ إِلَّا زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَٱلزَّانِيَةُ لَا يَنكِحُهَآ إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ وَحُرِّمَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,A fornicating man does not incline to marry except a fornicating woman like himself or an idolater who does not stay away from fornication. A fornicating woman does not incline to marry except a fornicating man like herself or an idolater who does not stay away from it. And marrying a fornicating male and female has been forbidden for believers.
"Those who defame chaste women and do not bring four witnesses should be punished with eighty lashes, and their testimony should not be accepted afterwards, for they are profligates,",3,24,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُوا۟ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَٱجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَٰنِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلَا تَقْبَلُوا۟ لَهُمْ شَهَٰدَةً أَبَدًا وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"Those who accuse chaste women of adultery (and chaste men likewise) and do not then bring four witnesses to testify to the adultery they have accused them of, flog them, O leaders, with eighty lashes, and never accept their testimony. Those who accuse chaste women are out of the obedience of Allah."
Except those who repent after this and reform; and God is surely forgiving and kind.,4,24,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Except those who repent to Allah after what they have done and correct their actions, for Allah will accept their repentance and their testimony. Allah is Forgiving to those of His servants who repent and is Merciful to them."
"Those who accuse their wives and do not have any witnesses except themselves, should swear four times in the name of God, the testimony of each such person being that he is speaking the truth,",5,24,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَٰجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلَّآ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَٰدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَٰدَٰتٍۭ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"And those men who accuse their wives but do not have witnesses to testify to the authenticity of what they have accused them of besides themselves, one amongst them will testify by Allah four times: that he is truthful in the accusation of adultery he has made against his wife."
And (swear) a fifth time that if he tell a lie the curse of God be on him.,6,24,وَٱلْخَٰمِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"Then on his fifth testimony, he will add that he is deserving of curse if he is lying in what he has accused her of."
"The woman's punishment can be averted if she swears four times by God as testimony that her husband is a liar,",7,24,وَيَدْرَؤُا۟ عَنْهَا ٱلْعَذَابَ أَن تَشْهَدَ أَرْبَعَ شَهَٰدَٰتٍۭ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,Through this she will be deserving of the fixed punishment for adultery. She will repel this fixed punishment by testifying by Allah four times: that he is lying in what he has accused her of.
Her fifth oath being that the curse of God be on her if her husband should be speaking the truth.,8,24,وَٱلْخَٰمِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Then on her fifth testimony, she will add that the anger of Allah be on her if he is truthful in what he has accused her of."
(This would not have been possible) if the grace and benevolence of God were not upon you; but God is compassionate and wise.,9,24,وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Had it not been for Allah’s grace on you, O people, and His mercy on you, and that He accepts those who repent amongst His servants and is Wise in His managing and legislating, He would have quickly punished you for your sins and disgraced you through them."
"Those who spread lies were a clique among you. Do not think that it was bad for you: In fact it has been good for you. Each of them will pay for the sin he has committed, and he who had greater share (of guilt) will suffer grievous punishment.",10,24,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُو بِٱلْإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنكُمْ لَا تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرًّا لَّكُم بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لِكُلِّ ٱمْرِئٍ مِّنْهُم مَّا ٱكْتَسَبَ مِنَ ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلَّذِى تَوَلَّىٰ كِبْرَهُۥ مِنْهُمْ لَهُۥ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Those that brought the slander (which was accusing the Mother of the Believers Aishah - may Allah be pleased with her - of adultery) are a group which affiliate themselves to you, O believers. Do not consider the slander they made as bad for you, but rather it is good, due to the reward and testing of the believers it contains, and due to the clearing the name of the Mother of the Believers it brings with it. For each person who shared in accusing her of adultery is the reward of the sin he earned, due to uttering the slander. And for the one who bore the majority of that by starting it is a great punishment. The one meant by that is the leader of the hypocrites, Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salool."
"Why did the faithful men and women not think well of their people when they heard this, and said: ""This is a clear lie?""",11,24,لَّوْلَآ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ ظَنَّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتُ بِأَنفُسِهِمْ خَيْرًا وَقَالُوا۟ هَٰذَآ إِفْكٌ مُّبِينٌ,"When the believers heard this great slander, why did they not believe the faultlessness of their believing brothers who were accused of that and say: “This is a clear lie”?"
Why did they not bring four witnesses (in support of their charge)? And since they did not bring the four witnesses they are themselves liars in the sight of God.,12,24,لَّوْلَا جَآءُو عَلَيْهِ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَإِذْ لَمْ يَأْتُوا۟ بِٱلشُّهَدَآءِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْكَٰذِبُونَ,"Why did those who accuse the Mother of the Believers Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) not bring four witnesses upon their grave accusation, to testify to the authenticity of what they attributed to her? But if they do not bring four witnesses on that, and they will never be able to bring them, they are liars in the order of Allah."
"Were it not for the grace of God and His mercy upon you in this world and the next, you would have suffered a great affliction for the false accusation.",13,24,وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِى مَآ أَفَضْتُمْ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Had it not been for Allah’s grace on you, O believers, and His mercy on you, as He did not quickly punish you and He accepted the repentance of those amongst you who repented, a great punishment would have afflicted you, due to the lie and accusation against the Mother of the Believers you delved into."
"When you talked about it and said what you did not know, and took it lightly -- though in the sight of God it was serious --",14,24,إِذْ تَلَقَّوْنَهُۥ بِأَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَتَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِكُم مَّا لَيْسَ لَكُم بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ وَتَحْسَبُونَهُۥ هَيِّنًا وَهُوَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَظِيمٌ,"When you were relating it from one another and passing it to one another through your mouths, despite its falsehood, you had no knowledge. You were thinking that is easy and light, whereas it is grave in the sight of Allah, due to it containing lying and accusing an innocent person."
"Why did you not say when you heard it: ""It is not for us to speak of it? God preserve us, it is a great calumny!""",15,24,وَلَوْلَآ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ قُلْتُم مَّا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّتَكَلَّمَ بِهَٰذَا سُبْحَٰنَكَ هَٰذَا بُهْتَٰنٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Why did you not say when you heard this slander: “It is not right for us to talk about this gross matter. Purity belongs to You, our Lord. This slander which they accused the Mother of the Believers of is a great lie”?"
"God counsels you not to do a thing like this, if you are believers.",16,24,يَعِظُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَن تَعُودُوا۟ لِمِثْلِهِۦٓ أَبَدًا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Allah reminds you and advises you so that you do not repeat such a slander and accuse an innocent person of adultery, if you believe in Allah."
"God explains His commands to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",17,24,وَيُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Allah makes clear for you the verses which comprise His rulings and advices. Allah is Knowing of your actions, nothing of them being hidden from Him and He shall reward you for them, Wise in His managing and His legislating."
"There is painful punishment in this world and the next for those who like that immorality should spread among the believers, for God knows and you do not know.",18,24,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةُ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Those who love for immoral acts to spread amongst the believers, one of them being to accuse of adultery, for them is a painful punishment in the world, by the fixed punishment of slander being executed upon them, and for them is the fire of Hell in the Hearafter. Allah knows their lies and the outcome of His servants’ matter, and He knows what is best for them and you do not know that."
But for the grace of God and His mercy (much harm would have been done); yet God is compassionate and kind.,19,24,وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Had it not been for Allah’s grace upon you, O you who fell into the slander, and His mercy on You, and had it not been that Allah is compassionate and merciful to you, He would have punished you quickly."
"O you who believe, do not follow in the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows in the footsteps of Satan will be induced by him to what is shameful and forbidden. But for the grace of God and His mercy upon you none of you would have escaped undefiled; but God makes whosoever He will grow in goodness, for God is all-hearing and all-knowing.",20,24,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّبِعُوا۟ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ فَإِنَّهُۥ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنكَرِ وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزَكِّى مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and who act on His sacred law, do not follow the ways of the satan in his adornment of falsehood. Whoever follows his ways - he commands despicable actions and sayings, and what the sacred law disapproves of. Had it not been for Allah’s grace upon you, O believers, not a single one of you would have become pure through repentance if he did repent, but in fact, Allah purifies whom He wants by accepting his repentance. Allah is Hearing of your statements, Knowing of your actions; nothing of them is hidden from Him and He shall reward you for them."
Let not those who are men of plenty and means among you swear that they will not give to their relatives and the poor and those who leave their homes in the service of God. They should forgive and overlook (their failings). Would you not like God to forgive you? And God is forgiving and kind.,21,24,وَلَا يَأْتَلِ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَٱلسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُوٓا۟ أُو۟لِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينَ وَٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلْيَعْفُوا۟ وَلْيَصْفَحُوٓا۟ أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"The people of virtue in religion and expanse in wealth should not swear an oath to stop giving their needy relatives, due to their poverty, amongst the migrants in Allah’s way, due to a sin they committed. They should pardon them and overlook them. Do you not love that Allah should forgive your sins when you pardon them and overlook them? Allah is Forgiving to those who repent amongst His servants and Merciful to them, so His servants should follow Him. This verse was revealed regarding Abu Bakr Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) when he swore an oath to stop spending on Mistah, due to his joining in the slander."
Verily those who blaspheme unsuspecting chaste believing women will be cursed in this world and the next; and for them there will be severe punishment.,22,24,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ٱلْغَٰفِلَٰتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ لُعِنُوا۟ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Those who accuse chaste innocent women of adultery the believing women are unaware of are removed from the mercy of Allah in this world and the Hearafter, and for them is a great punishment in the Hearafter."
"The day their tongues and hands and feet bear witness to what they had done,",23,24,يَوْمَ تَشْهَدُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَلْسِنَتُهُمْ وَأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"They will get that punishment on the Day of Judgment, the day when their tongues will testify against them as to the falsehood they spoke, and their hands and feet will testify against them as to what they used to do."
"God will pay them on that day their just due in full, and they will come to know that God is the tangible Reality.",24,24,يَوْمَئِذٍ يُوَفِّيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ دِينَهُمُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"On that day, Allah will give them their full reward with justice and they will know Allah is the Truth. Every piece of information, promise or warning that comes from Him is clearly true without any doubt in it."
"Bad women deserve bad men, and bad men are for bad women; but good women are for good men, and good men for good women, for they are innocent of what people say. There is forgiveness for them and a gracious provision.",25,24,ٱلْخَبِيثَٰتُ لِلْخَبِيثِينَ وَٱلْخَبِيثُونَ لِلْخَبِيثَٰتِ وَٱلطَّيِّبَٰتُ لِلطَّيِّبِينَ وَٱلطَّيِّبُونَ لِلطَّيِّبَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Every evil man, woman, saying and action is suited to what is evil and conforms to it, and every good thing of that is suited to what is good and conforms to it. Those good men and women are innocent of what the evil men and women say about them. For them is forgiveness from Allah through which He will forgive their sins, and for them is noble sustenance which is paradise."
"O you who believe, do not enter other houses except yours without first asking permission and saluting the inmates. This is better for you: You may haply take heed.",26,24,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَدْخُلُوا۟ بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تَسْتَأْنِسُوا۟ وَتُسَلِّمُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهَا ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act on His sacred law, do not enter houses besides your own houses until you seek permission from their inhabitants to enter them and you greet them, by saying in greeting and seeking permission: “Peace be on you, can I come in?” That seeking permission you have been ordered is better for you than entering suddenly, so that you remember what you have been ordered and then carry it out."
"If you find that no one is in, then do not enter unless you have received permission. If you are asked to go away, turn back. That is proper for you. God is aware of what you do.",27,24,فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُوا۟ فِيهَآ أَحَدًا فَلَا تَدْخُلُوهَا حَتَّىٰ يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ وَإِن قِيلَ لَكُمُ ٱرْجِعُوا۟ فَٱرْجِعُوا۟ هُوَ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"But if you do not find anyone in those houses, do not enter them until you are permitted to enter by those who have the authority to give permission. And if their owners tell you to return, return and do not enter them, as this is purer for you in the sight of Allah. Allah is Knowing of what you do; none of your actions are hidden from Him and He shall reward you for them."
"There is no harm in going into uninhabited houses where there is some convenience for you, as God has knowledge of what you hide and what you disclose.",28,24,لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَدْخُلُوا۟ بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ فِيهَا مَتَٰعٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,"There is no blame on you, for entering without permission, public houses which are not specifically for any person and which have been prepared for general benefit, such as libraries and shops in markets. Allah knows the actions and conditions which you display and which you hide; none of that is hidden from Him and He shall reward you for them."
Tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts. There is for them goodness in this. God is aware of what they do.,29,24,قُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا۟ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا۟ فُرُوجَهُمْ ذَٰلِكَ أَزْكَىٰ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,"O Messenger, tell the believing men to stop their eyes from looking at women and private parts that are unlawful for them, and to protect their private parts from indulging in the unlawful and from exposing them. That refraining from looking at what Allah has made unlawful is purer for them in the sight of Allah. Allah is Aware of what you do."
"Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts, and not display their charms except what is apparent outwardly, and cover their bosoms with their veils and not to show their finery except to their husbands or their fathers or fathers-in-law, their sons or step-sons, brothers, or their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women attendants or captives, or male attendants who do not have any need (for women), or boys not yet aware of sex. They should not walk stamping their feet lest they make known what they hide of their Ornaments. O believers, turn to God, every one of you, so that you may be successful.",30,24,وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَٰنِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِىٓ إِخْوَٰنِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِىٓ أَخَوَٰتِهِنَّ أَوْ نِسَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُنَّ أَوِ ٱلتَّٰبِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُو۟لِى ٱلْإِرْبَةِ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ أَوِ ٱلطِّفْلِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُوا۟ عَلَىٰ عَوْرَٰتِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلَا يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِينَ مِن زِينَتِهِنَّ وَتُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"And tell the believing women to stop their eyes from looking at the private parts Allah has made unlawful for them to look at and to protect their private parts by staying far from indecency and by covering themselves. And they should not display their beauty to strangers except that which is apparent thereof and which cannot be hidden, such as clothing. They should draw their coverings over the openings at the top of their clothes, to cover their hair, faces and necks, and they should not expose their hidden beauty except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands’ fathers, or their sons, or their husbands’ sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their women who are believers, be they Muslim or disbelievers, or the servants they own, be they male or female, or male attendants who have no desire for women, or children who have not become aware of the private aspects of women due to their being small. And women should not strike their feet with the intention of making known the adornment they are hiding, such as anklets and so forth. And all of you repent to Allah, O believers, for the gaze and so forth which affects you, in the hope that you are successful in attaining the goal and are saved from what is feared."
"Marry off those who are single among you, and those of your male and female servants who are righteous. If they are poor, God will enrich them of His grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing.",31,24,وَأَنكِحُوا۟ ٱلْأَيَٰمَىٰ مِنكُمْ وَٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ وَإِمَآئِكُمْ إِن يَكُونُوا۟ فُقَرَآءَ يُغْنِهِمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"O believers, marry off the unmarried free men and women amongst you, and marry off the believers amongst your male and female servants. If they are poor, Allah will make them wealthy through His vast grace. Allah is Vast in sustaining, without His making anyone wealthy decrease His sustenance, and Knowing of the conditions of His servants."
"Those who cannot afford to marry should abstain from what is unlawful until God enriches them by His grace. And free those slaves you possess who wish to buy their freedom after a written undertaking, if you know they have some goodness, and give them out of the riches God has given you. Do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives, in order to get the benefits of this world. But if someone forces them, surely God (will forgive them) after their forced helplessness, for He is forgiving and kind.",32,24,وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحًا حَتَّىٰ يُغْنِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا وَءَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا۟ فَتَيَٰتِكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْبِغَآءِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّنًا لِّتَبْتَغُوا۟ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَن يُكْرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ إِكْرَٰهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Those who are unable to marry due to their poverty should seek chastity from fornication until Allah makes them wealthy through His vast grace. Those servants who wish to make a contract with their masters, to give money so that they can be free, their masters should accept that of them if they know they have the ability to fulfil and are upright in religion. It is necessary upon them to give them from the wealth Allah has granted them, by discounting them a portion of what they agreed to pay. And do not force your slave girls to fornicate, in pursuit of wealth, as Abdullah ibn Ubayy did with his two slave girls when they requested chastity and staying far from fornication, to seek what she earns through her private parts. Whoever forces them to do that, Allah is Forgiving of their sins after their being forced and Merciful to them, because they are being forced, and the sin is upon the one who forces them."
"We have sent down clear instructions to you, and illustrations from (the accounts) of those who have gone before you, and a warning for those who take heed for themselves.",33,24,وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتٍ مُّبَيِّنَٰتٍ وَمَثَلًا مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"I revealed to you, O people, clear verses in which there is no confusion. And I revealed to you examples of the believers and disbelievers who passed before you, and I revealed to you an admonition through which those who fear their Lord by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions are admonished."
"God is the light of the heavens and the earth. The semblance of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass, the glass a glittering star as it were, lit with the oil of a blessed tree, the olive, neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil appears to light up even though fire touches it not, -- light upon light. God guides to His light whom He will. So does God advance precepts of wisdom for men, for God has knowledge of everything.",34,24,ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ مَثَلُ نُورِهِۦ كَمِشْكَوٰةٍ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ٱلْمِصْبَاحُ فِى زُجَاجَةٍ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّىٌّ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَٰرَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ لَّا شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلَا غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِىٓءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ يَهْدِى ٱللَّهُ لِنُورِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْأَمْثَٰلَ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth, and the Guide of all those in them. The example of His light in the heart of a believer is like a closed niche which contains a lantern. The lantern is in a bright glass, as though it is a shining star like a pearl. The lantern is lit by the oil of a blessed tree, which is the olive tree. Nothing conceals the tree from the sun, neither in the morning nor in the evening. The oil is about to glow, due to its purity, even though a fire has not touched it; imagine how it will be when it touches it? The light of the lantern is on the light of the glass. Likewise is the heart of the believer when the light of guidance shines in it. Allah enables whomever He wishes amongst His servants to follow the Qur’ān. And Allah makes things clear through their likenesses, by giving examples. And Allah is Knowing of everything, nothing being hidden from Him."
"(The light is lit) in houses of worship which God has allowed to be raised, and His name remembered in them. His praises are sung there morning and evening,",35,24,فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ ٱللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُۥ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُۥ فِيهَا بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلْءَاصَالِ,"This lantern is lit in the mosques which Allah has ordered be kept clean from impurities and dirt, to be elevated, and to have His name remembered therein through the call to prayer, remembrance and prayer. There pray in them, seeking the pleasure of Allah, at the beginning and end of the day"
"By men not distracted from the remembrance of God either by trade and commerce or buying and selling, who stand by their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, who fear the day when hearts and eyes would flutter with trepidation",36,24,رِجَالٌ لَّا تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَٰرَةٌ وَلَا بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَإِيتَآءِ ٱلزَّكَوٰةِ يَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ,"Men whom buying and selling does not distract from the remembrance of Allah, performing prayer with perfection and giving Zakat, where required. They fear the Day of Judgment: that day on which the hearts will fluctuate between hope in salvation from and fear of the punishment, and the eyes will wander in every direction in anxiety."
"That God may reward them for the best of their deeds, and bestow more on them of His bounty, for God gives whom He please without measure.",37,24,لِيَجْزِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"They do that so that Allah may reward them upon the best of their actions and increase their reward through His grace. And Allah provides without account for whomsoever He wishes, according to their deeds; rather, He grants them in multitudes over the value of their deeds."
"As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in the desert which the thirsty takes for water till he reaches it to find that there was nothing, and finds God with him who settles his account, for God is swift at the reckoning.",38,24,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍۭ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ ٱلظَّمْـَٔانُ مَآءً حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَهُۥ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْـًٔا وَوَجَدَ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُۥ فَوَفَّىٰهُ حِسَابَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"There is no reward for the deeds of those who disbelieve in Allah; it is like a mirage that a thirsty person sees on a low-lying piece of land and assumes it to be water. He walks towards it, until when he reaches it, does not find any water. Likewise is a disbeliever: he thinks his deeds shall benefit him, until he dies and is resurrected, but does not find their reward. Rather, he finds his Lord in front of him who takes him to account fully for his deeds; and Allah is swift in taking account."
"Or like darkness in a wide, wide sea, waves surging upon waves, with clouds overhanging, darkness on darkness. If you stretch your hand, you could hardly see it. For him whom God does not give any light, there is no light.",39,24,أَوْ كَظُلُمَٰتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ يَغْشَىٰهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِۦ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِۦ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَٰتٌۢ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَآ أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُۥ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَىٰهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ نُورًا فَمَا لَهُۥ مِن نُّورٍ,"Or their deeds are like the many darkness in the depth of the ocean, over which is a wave, over which is another wave, over which is a cloud covering the navigating stars. Compounded layers of darkness, one above the other; if the one that finds himself among such darkness were to remove his hand in front of him, he would barely see it. Likewise is a disbeliever: the darkness of ignorance, doubt, confusion and his heart being sealed up, gather up on him. Whoever Allah does not grant guidance from error to and knowledge of the Book, will never find any other guidance or any other book from which he can seek enlightenment."
"Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds on the wing, sing the praises of God. Each one knows its obligations and its duties, and God knows whatever they do.",40,24,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلطَّيْرُ صَٰٓفَّٰتٍ كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلَاتَهُۥ وَتَسْبِيحَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"O Messenger! Do you not know that all the inhabitants of the heavens and earth from the creation of Allah, glorify Him? The birds that fly in formation also glorify Him. Of all those creations, Allah knows of the prayer of every one who prays, i.e. the human; and the glorification of every one that glorifies Him, i.e. the birds. Allah is all-aware of what they do, no action of theirs is hidden from Him."
"For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and the returning is to God.",41,24,وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"To Allah alone belongs supreme authority over the heavens and earth, and to Him alone will everyone return for accountability and requital."
"Have you not seen that God drives the clouds, then joins them together and puts them fold on fold. Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please. His lightning could snatch away their eyes.",42,24,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزْجِى سَحَابًا ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيْنَهُۥ ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُۥ رُكَامًا فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَٰلِهِۦ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِنۢ بَرَدٍ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُۥ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ يَكَادُ سَنَا بَرْقِهِۦ يَذْهَبُ بِٱلْأَبْصَٰرِ,"O Messenger! Do you not know that Allah drives the clouds, then joins parts of them together, then makes them into layers, one above the other. You then see the rain coming out from the cloud, and falling from the sky from parts of cloud like mountains, falling as hail. That hail reaches whoever Allah wills from His servants, and He turns it away from whomsoever He wills. It is extremely possible that the light from bolts of lightning blinds the eyesight."
It is God who alternates night and day. There is surely a lesson in this for men of sight.,43,24,يُقَلِّبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَبْصَٰرِ,"Allah alternates between the length of the day and night. Indeed, in that alternation is a lesson in the power of Allah and His oneness, for those who have foresight."
"God created every moving thing from water: One crawls on its belly, one walks on two legs, another moves on four. God creates whatsoever He will. Indeed God has power over everything.",44,24,وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَآبَّةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ فَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَىٰٓ أَرْبَعٍ يَخْلُقُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"And Allah has created everything that walks on the face of the earth from a drop of sperm. Some walk crawling on their bellies, i.e. snakes, while some walk on two feet, i.e. humans and birds, while others walk on four legs, i.e. livestock. Allah creates whatever He wishes, including things mentioned and unmentioned. Indeed, He is capable of everything; Nothing is outside His ability."
We have surely sent down clear signs. It is God who guides whom He will to the path that is straight.,45,24,لَّقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ ءَايَٰتٍ مُّبَيِّنَٰتٍ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Verily, I revealed clear verses unto Muhammad peace be upon him, wherein there is no ambiguity. Allah guides whoever He wishes to the straight path in which there is no deviance, which in turn leads him to paradise."
"They say they believe in God and the Prophet, and have come to believe, yet a section of them turns back even after this; and these are not believers.",46,24,وَيَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَمَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"And the hypocrites say, “We have believed in Allah and the Messenger, and obeyed Allah and His Messenger”, then a group from among them turns away. So after claiming to have faith in Allah and His Messenger and obeying them, in reality they do not obey Allah and His Messenger in fulfilling the command to jihad in Allah’s way, and the like. In truth, those who turn away from the obedience of Allah and His Messenger are not believers, despite claiming to be."
"When they are called to God and His Prophet, that he may judge between them, a section of them turns away.",47,24,وَإِذَا دُعُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ,"And if these hypocrites are called to Allah and the Messenger so that the Messenger can pass Judgement between them in matters they dispute among themselves, they will reject his Judgement due to their hypocrisy."
Had right been on their side they would have come to him submissively.,48,24,وَإِن يَكُن لَّهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ يَأْتُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ مُذْعِنِينَ,"Yet if they know the truth to be in their favour, and that he will judge in their favour, they will come to him submissive and humble."
"Is there a malady in their hearts, or they are deluded, or afraid that God and His Prophet would be unjust in dealing with them? Not so; they are themselves unjust.",49,24,أَفِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ أَمِ ٱرْتَابُوٓا۟ أَمْ يَخَافُونَ أَن يَحِيفَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَرَسُولُهُۥ بَلْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"Is there a chronic illness in the hearts of these people, or is it that they are in doubt as to whether he is the Messenger of Allah? Or is it that they fear Allah or His Messenger will wrong them in Judgement? No, it is none of the aforementioned, rather, it is because of a defect within their souls due to their turning away from his Judgement, and their opposition to him."
"The answer of the believers when they are called to God and His Apostle that he may judge between them, is: ""We hear and obey."" And they are the ones who will prosper.",50,24,إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"When the believers are called towards Allah and His Messenger for him to judge between them, their only reaction is that they say, “We have heard his statement and obeyed his order”. Those who possess this characteristic are the ones who are successful in the world and the Hearafter."
"Whoever obeys God and His Prophet, fears God and does his duty to Him, will surely find success.",51,24,وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَيَخْشَ ٱللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,"And whoever obeys Allah and obeys His Messenger, fears the outcome of sins, and prevents the punishment of Allah upon themselves by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions, only they are the ones who achieve the success of both the world and the Hearafter."
"They swear solemnly by God: ""If you command us we shall go forth."" Say: ""Do not swear. What is wanted is obedience, as should be. God is certainly aware of what you do.""",52,24,وَأَقْسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ لَئِنْ أَمَرْتَهُمْ لَيَخْرُجُنَّ قُل لَّا تُقْسِمُوا۟ طَاعَةٌ مَّعْرُوفَةٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"The hypocrites take the strongest and far-fetched of oaths possible upon Allah, saying that if you were to command them to march out to jihad, they would indeed do so. O Messenger! Say to them: “Do not take oaths, for your lying is well known, as is your claimed submission. Allah is well-aware of your actions; no action of yours is hidden from Him, regardless of how you try to hide them."
"Say: ""Obey God and obey the Apostle. If you turn away, then for him is his duty to fulfil, and for you the burden that you carry; yet if you obey him you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is to convey the message clearly.",53,24,قُلْ أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْهِ مَا حُمِّلَ وَعَلَيْكُم مَّا حُمِّلْتُمْ وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا۟ وَمَا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"O Messenger! Say to these hypocrites: “Obey Allah and His Messenger both physically and spiritually. If you turn away from their obedience as you have been commanded, then his responsibility is only to convey the message as he has been tasked, whereas the responsibility you have been tasked with is to obey and implement whatever he has brought. If you obey him in whatever he commands you to do and refrain from whatever he prevents you from, you shall be guided to the truth. The Messenger’s responsibility is only to convey the message clearly, not to carry you onto guidance or force you upon it.”"
"God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them, and will establish their faith which He has chosen for them and change their fear into security. They will worship Me and not associate any one with Me. But those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates.",54,24,وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ كَمَا ٱسْتَخْلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى ٱرْتَضَىٰ لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا يَعْبُدُونَنِى لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِى شَيْـًٔا وَمَن كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"Allah has promised those of you who believe in Him and perform good deeds, that He will help them against their enemies and make them rulers on earth. Just like He made the believers before them rulers on earth and promised them that He would make the religion of Islam He preferred for them established and dominant; He also promised that He will change their circumstances of fear into peace, as long as they worshipped Him alone and did not ascribe partners to Him. Whoever shows ingratitude after all those blessings are the very ones who leave the obedience of Allah."
"So observe your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey the Apostle so that you may be shown mercy.",55,24,وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"And perform prayer to perfection, give Zakat on your wealth and obey the Messenger in whatever he commands you with, together with leaving whatever he prevents you from, in the hope that you shall be safe from your fears and be successful in your objectives."
Do not think that unbelievers will subvert (the authority of God) on earth. Their abode is Hell; and what an evil destination!,56,24,لَا تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَأْوَىٰهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,O Messenger! Do not ever think that those who disbelieve in Allah will slip away from Him when He intends to punish them. Their abode on the Day of Judgment is hell; what an evil abode hell is!
"O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid-day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you. There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission). God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",57,24,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لِيَسْتَـْٔذِنكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَبْلُغُوا۟ ٱلْحُلُمَ مِنكُمْ ثَلَٰثَ مَرَّٰتٍ مِّن قَبْلِ صَلَوٰةِ ٱلْفَجْرِ وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَابَكُم مِّنَ ٱلظَّهِيرَةِ وَمِنۢ بَعْدِ صَلَوٰةِ ٱلْعِشَآءِ ثَلَٰثُ عَوْرَٰتٍ لَّكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَا عَلَيْهِمْ جُنَاحٌۢ بَعْدَهُنَّ طَوَّٰفُونَ عَلَيْكُم بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon the laws set for them! Your free immature children, male servants and female servants should seek permission from you thrice, at three times: before the morning prayer at the time of changing from nightwear into daily clothes, in the afternoon when changing clothes for the siesta and after the night prayer because it is the time when you remove your daywear and change into your nightwear. These are three times of privacy for you; they should not enter your rooms except after taking permission from you. Apart from these times, there is no harm in them entering your rooms nor you entering theirs, because you frequently have to move around one another and so it would be an inconvenience to prevent them from entering except with permission. Just as Allah has made the rulings of seeking permission clear to you, He also makes clear the verses that show the rulings He has laid down for you. Allah is ever-aware of the requirements of His servants; wise in whatever laws He passes for them."
"When your children have reached the age of puberty, they should similarly ask your leave (for entering) as others did before them. God thus clearly explains His commands to you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.",58,24,وَإِذَا بَلَغَ ٱلْأَطْفَٰلُ مِنكُمُ ٱلْحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَـْٔذِنُوا۟ كَمَا ٱسْتَـْٔذَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"When your children reach the age of puberty they should seek permission at all times before entering into your homes, as has been mentioned regarding the adults previously. Just as Allah makes clear the rulings of seeking permission for you, He also makes His verses clear. And Allah is ever-aware of the requirements of His servants; wise in whatever laws He passes for them."
"As for your women past the age of bearing children, who have no hope of marriage, there is no harm if they take off their outer garments, but in such a way that they do not display their charms; yet if they avoid this it would be better for them. God is all-hearing and all-knowing.",59,24,وَٱلْقَوَٰعِدُ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ ٱلَّٰتِى لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَٰتٍۭ بِزِينَةٍ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"And the elderly women that no longer experience menstruation, or can no longer give birth, nor have any desire to marry again, there is no sin upon them if they do not wear some of their outer garments i.e. overcloak and veil, as long as they do not expose the beauty they have been commanded to conceal. However, for them to wear those garments is better for them than to discard them, enhancing veiling and chastity. Allah is all-hearing of your statements; none of them are hidden from Him and He shall requit you for them."
"There is no harm if the blind, the lame, the sick, or you yourselves, eat in your own houses or the houses of your fathers, mothers, or your brothers' houses, or those of your sisters, or your fathers' brothers' or sisters', or your mothers' brothers' or sisters', or in the houses whose care is entrusted to you, or the houses of your friends.",60,24,لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلْأَعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَن تَأْكُلُوا۟ مِنۢ بُيُوتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ ءَابَآئِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ إِخْوَٰنِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخَوَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَعْمَٰمِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ عَمَّٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخْوَٰلِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ خَٰلَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحَهُۥٓ أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُوا۟ جَمِيعًا أَوْ أَشْتَاتًا فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُم بُيُوتًا فَسَلِّمُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ تَحِيَّةً مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُبَٰرَكَةً طَيِّبَةً كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"There is no sin upon the blind who has lost his eyesight, nor upon the lame nor the sick if they leave those responsibilities they can no longer fulfil, i.e. jihad in the way of Allah. O believers! There is no sin upon you in eating from your own homes or the homes of sons, nor in eating from the homes of your fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, paternal uncles and aunts nor maternal uncles and aunts, nor those houses which you have been entrusted with safeguarding, i.e. garden-keeper. There is also no sin in eating at the house of your friend as is customary to please him. It is not a problem whether you eat alone or together in groups. So when you do enter any houses like the ones mentioned above or any others, greet those within them with peace by saying: “Peace be upon you”, and if there is no one inside them, then greet yourselves by saying: “Peace be upon us and the pious servants of Allah”. This is a blessed greeting from Allah; He has legislated it for you because of the love and affection it spreads among you. It is also a pleasant greeting in that it pleases the soul of the one who hears is Just like the aforementioned clarity in this Sūrah, Allah clearly explains His verses in the hope that you will implement whatever they contain."
"There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God's forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind.",61,24,إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَإِذَا كَانُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ عَلَىٰٓ أَمْرٍ جَامِعٍ لَّمْ يَذْهَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يَسْتَـْٔذِنُوهُ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَـْٔذِنُونَكَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ فَإِذَا ٱسْتَـْٔذَنُوكَ لِبَعْضِ شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَن لِّمَن شِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"The believers who are true in their faith are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are summoned to convene by the Prophet peace be upon him for a matter in relation to the affairs of the Muslims, they do not leave until they seek his permission to do so. O Messenger! Indeed, those who seek your permission before leaving, they are the ones who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger; so if they seek your permission to leave due to some important matter that concerns them, grant permission to whomsoever you wish from them and ask Allah to forgive their sins. Indeed, Allah Forgiving of the sins of whoever repents from His servants, and is merciful to them."
Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously. So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.,62,24,لَّا تَجْعَلُوا۟ دُعَآءَ ٱلرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُم بَعْضًا قَدْ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَسَلَّلُونَ مِنكُمْ لِوَاذًا فَلْيَحْذَرِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِۦٓ أَن تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"O believers! Honour the Messenger of Allah; when you call out to him, do not call him by name, e.g. “O Muhammad!”, or the name of his father, e.g. “O the son of Abdullah!”, like you call one another. Rather, say: “O Messenger of Allah, O Prophet of Allah!” And when he summons you for a general matter, do not treat his summoning like that of each other in petty issues; rather, hasten to answering his summon. Verily, Allah knows of those of you who leave covertly without seeking permission, so those who go against the command of the Messenger of Allah peace be upon him should fear that Allah can afflict them with trials and afflictions, or with a painful punishment they cannot bear."
"Does not everything in the heavens and the earth belong to God? He surely knows what state you are in; and on the day they go back to Him. He will tell them what they used to do, for God has knowledge of everything.",63,24,أَلَآ إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَيَوْمَ يُرْجَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ فَيُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۢ,"Know well that to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and on earth: in terms of being His creation, under His supreme authority and His control. O people! He knows whatever conditions you are in; nothing is hidden from Him, and on the Day of Judgment when you return to Him after resurrection, He will inform you of all the deeds you did in the world. Allah knows everything, nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from Him."
"BLESSED IS HE who revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong) to His votary that it may be a warning for the world, --",0,25,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِى نَزَّلَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِۦ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَٰلَمِينَ نَذِيرًا,"Blessed is Allah who revealed the Qur’ān as a standard distinguishing between truth and falsehood, onto His servant and Messenger Muhammad peace be upon him, so that he could be a Messenger towards the humans and the jinn, and a warner to them of the punishment of Allah."
"He to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, who has neither begotten a son nor has He a partner in His kingdom, (who) created everything and determined its exact measure.",1,25,ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ شَرِيكٌ فِى ٱلْمُلْكِ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُۥ تَقْدِيرًا,"The One to Whom alone belongs authority over the heavens and earth, Who did not beget a child, nor has any partner in His authority, Who created everything appropriately and foresaw its creation according to His knowledge and wisdom to perfection."
"Yet they choose apart from Him gods who have not created any thing and have themselves been created, who possess no power over their loss or gain, or their death or life or being raised to life again.",2,25,وَٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةً لَّا يَخْلُقُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ وَلَا يَمْلِكُونَ لِأَنفُسِهِمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُونَ مَوْتًا وَلَا حَيَوٰةً وَلَا نُشُورًا,"Instead of Allah, the idolaters adopted deities who cannot create anything small or large, but are themselves created. Verily, Allah created them from non-existence; they are unable to fend off any harm from themselves nor bring themselves any benefit, nor are they able to cause death to any living or give life to any dead, or raise the dead from their graves."
"Yet the unbelievers say: ""This is nothing but a lie he has concocted in which others have aided him."" They have come down to mischief and lies.",3,25,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ إِفْكٌ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ وَأَعَانَهُۥ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ ءَاخَرُونَ فَقَدْ جَآءُو ظُلْمًا وَزُورًا,"And those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger said: “This Qur’ān is nothing but a lie which Muhammad has fabricated and blasphemously attributed to Allah. Other people have also helped him in its fabrication”. These disbelievers themselves have made a false statement, because the Qur’ān is the speech of Allah; it is impossible for humans and jinn to come up anything like it."
"And they say: ""These are fables of antiquity he has invented, which are dictated to him morning and evening.""",4,25,وَقَالُوٓا۟ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ ٱكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا,"And these rejecters of the Qur’ān said, “The Qur’ān is vain tales of the previous people which they used to record; Muhammad has copied them. They are recited to him throughout the day”."
"Say: ""He who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth has revealed it to me; and He is surely forgiving and kind.""",5,25,قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ ٱلَّذِى يَعْلَمُ ٱلسِّرَّ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"O Messenger! Say to these rejecters: The Qur’ān was revealed by Allah, Who knows of everything in the heavens and earth. It is not made up as you think it to be. Indeed, Allah Forgiving of those of His servants who repent, and is merciful to them."
"But they say: ""What sort of prophet is this who eats food and walks the market places? Why was no angel sent to him to act as admonisher with him?",6,25,وَقَالُوا۟ مَالِ هَٰذَا ٱلرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِى فِى ٱلْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُۥ نَذِيرًا,"The idolaters who rejected the Prophet peace be upon him said, “What is wrong with this man that claims he is a messenger from Allah when he eats food just as other people do, and walks around the markets in search of livelihood? Why did Allah not send an angel with him who would accompany him, proclaim his truthfulness and help him?”"
"Or a treasure should have been given to him, or he should have had an orchard from which he could eat."" And these wicked people say: ""You only follow a man ensorcelled.""",7,25,أَوْ يُلْقَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ كَنزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُۥ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا رَجُلًا مَّسْحُورًا,"“Or send down a treasure for him from the heavens, or that he has a garden from which he eats fruits, so that he does not need to walk around the markets in search of livelihood?” The oppressors also said, “O believers! You are not following any messenger; you are only following a man whose intellect has been overwhelmed by magic.”"
Just see what comparisons they bring up for you! They are lost and cannot find the way.,8,25,ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُوا۟ لَكَ ٱلْأَمْثَٰلَ فَضَلُّوا۟ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَبِيلًا,"O Messenger! You should see and be amazed at how they can describe you with such false attributes, i.e. they said, “He is a magician”, “He has been spellbound”, and “He is insane”, so they deviated from the truth because of that. They are incapable of treading the path towards guidance and of questioning your truthfulness and honesty."
"Blessed be He who, if He pleased, could give you better than that, -- gardens with rivers flowing by; and make palaces for you.",9,25,تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِىٓ إِن شَآءَ جَعَلَ لَكَ خَيْرًا مِّن ذَٰلِكَ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَيَجْعَل لَّكَ قُصُورًۢا,"Blessed is Allah Who can, if He wishes, give you the good they think up for you like the gardens under the trees of which streams flow and the fruits of which you can eat; and can also grant you palaces in which you can live in luxury."
Yet they reject the Hour as untrue. We have prepared a Fire for those who deny the Resurrection.,10,25,بَلْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِٱلسَّاعَةِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِٱلسَّاعَةِ سَعِيرًا,"The statements that came from them were not said in search of the truth or evidence, rather, in conclusion, they have rejected the Day of Judgment. And for whoever rejects the Day of Judgment, I have prepared a blazing fire."
When (Hell) appears to them from a distance they will hear it raging and roaring.,11,25,إِذَا رَأَتْهُم مِّن مَّكَانٍۭ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُوا۟ لَهَا تَغَيُّظًا وَزَفِيرًا,"When the disbelievers will look at the hellfire from a distance, they will hear an unsettling, severe boiling sound emitting from it due to its anger upon them."
"And when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together, they would plead for death.",12,25,وَإِذَآ أُلْقُوا۟ مِنْهَا مَكَانًا ضَيِّقًا مُّقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْا۟ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُورًا,"And when these disbelievers will be thrown into hell from a tight place, with their hands chained to their necks, they will call destruction upon themselves hoping to escape from hell."
"""Do not ask for one death but many deaths on this day.""",13,25,لَّا تَدْعُوا۟ ٱلْيَوْمَ ثُبُورًا وَٰحِدًا وَٱدْعُوا۟ ثُبُورًا كَثِيرًا,"O disbelievers! Do not call upon one type of destruction for yourselves today; call upon many types! It will make no difference; you will not be granted what you seek. Instead, you will remain in painful punishment forever."
"Ask them: ""Is this better or a garden for everlasting abode which has been promised the pious and devout? It would be their guerdon and their destination.",14,25,قُلْ أَذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ أَمْ جَنَّةُ ٱلْخُلْدِ ٱلَّتِى وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَزَآءً وَمَصِيرًا,"O Messenger! Say to them: “Is the aforementioned punishment described for you better, or the everlasting paradise with its eternal blessings that never finish? It is the very same one that Allah has promised His Allah-conscious servants as a reward and abode they will return to on the Day of Judgment.”"
"There will they have whatever they wish, and there abide for ever."" This is a promise incumbent on your Lord which will certainly be fulfilled.",15,25,لَّهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ خَٰلِدِينَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ وَعْدًا مَّسْـُٔولًا,"In this paradise, they will have whatever blessings they desire; that is a promise on Allah which His Allah-conscious servants will ask Him for. And the promise of Allah will be fulfilled, because He never breaks promises."
"The day He will gather them together along with those they worshipped other than God, He will ask them: ""Did you lure these creatures of Mine away, or did they themselves go astray?""",16,25,وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَقُولُ ءَأَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِى هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ أَمْ هُمْ ضَلُّوا۟ ٱلسَّبِيلَ,"On the day when the rejecting idolaters will be gathered, together with whatever they worshipped instead of Allah, He will say to those worshipped, scolding those who worshipped them, “Did you lead My servants astray by commanding them to worship you, or did they go astray of their own accord?”"
"They will answer: ""Glory to You. It was not worthy of us to seek any protector other than You. But You allowed them and their fathers a life of ease until they turned oblivious of the Reminder. They were a people impenitent.",17,25,قَالُوا۟ سُبْحَٰنَكَ مَا كَانَ يَنۢبَغِى لَنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَلَٰكِن مَّتَّعْتَهُمْ وَءَابَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ نَسُوا۟ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَكَانُوا۟ قَوْمًۢا بُورًا,"The worshipped ones will say, “Our Lord! You are exalted from having any partner. It was not for us to take any guardians instead of You, so how could we call Your servants to worship us instead of You? Our Lord! Rather, You granted these idolaters and their forefathers enjoyment through the pleasures of the world, gradually leading them into their destruction, until they forgot Your remembrance and worshipped others with You. They were people doomed due to their wretchedness.”"
"(The idolaters will be told): ""Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help. We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment.""",18,25,فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوكُم بِمَا تَقُولُونَ فَمَا تَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفًا وَلَا نَصْرًا وَمَن يَظْلِم مِّنكُمْ نُذِقْهُ عَذَابًا كَبِيرًا,"O idolaters! Verily, those you worshipped other than Allah have belied you in your claims against them, so you cannot fend off the punishment from yourselves nor help them due to your incapability. O believers! Whoever oppresses from amongst you by ascribing partners to Allah, I shall make him suffer a great punishment, just like I will make the ones mentioned suffer."
We never sent before you apostles who did not eat food and walk the market places. We make some of you the means of trying the others. So will you persevere? Your Lord is always watching.,19,25,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّآ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى ٱلْأَسْوَاقِ وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِيرًا,"O Messenger! All the messengers I sent before you were humans who would eat food and walk in the markets; you are not a unique messenger in that sense. O people! I have made you tests for each other by granting you varying degrees of affluence, poverty, health and sickness; throughout these different circumstances, will you bear whatever I afflict you with so that I may reward you upon your patience? Your Lord is ever-aware of those who bear patience and those who do not, and those who obey Him and those who disobey Him."
"Those who do not hope to meet Us say: ""Why are no angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?"" They are full of self-conceit and behave with intense arrogance.",20,25,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَىٰ رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْ عُتُوًّا كَبِيرًا,"The disbelievers who do not expect to meet Me and who do not fear My punishment said, “Why does not Allah send down the angels to us, so they can tell us about the truth of Muhammad?’ or ‘Why can we not see our Lord with our own eyes, so He can tell us about that?’ They are too proud within themselves and this prevented them from having faith, and they have gone beyond the limit of disbelief and transgression by this statement of theirs."
"The day they see the angels there will be no happy tidings for the sinners; and they will say: ""There is an insurmountable barrier!""",21,25,يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ لَا بُشْرَىٰ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا,"On the Day when these people will see the angels at the time of their death, in the Transitory Stage, when they are resurrected, when they are driven to give account and when they are entered into the Fire, there will be no good news for them on those occasions, unlike the believers, and the angels will say to them, “Unlawful and forbidden for you is the good news from Allah.”"
We shall turn to their deeds and scatter them like particles of dust.,22,25,وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَىٰ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَٰهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُورًا,"I shall turn to the good deeds the disbelievers did in the world and due to their invalidity and lack of benefit because of their disbelief, I will scatter them like the particles of dust a person sees in the window."
"The inmates of Paradise will have a better abode that day, and a better resting place.",23,25,أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرًّا وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلًا,"The believers, the people of Paradise, on that day will have a better position and place of rest and sleep than these disbelievers. That is because of their faith in Allah and their righteous deeds."
"The day the heavens splits asunder with a dazzling white cloud gathering and the angels descend in a continuous stream,",24,25,وَيَوْمَ تَشَقَّقُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ بِٱلْغَمَٰمِ وَنُزِّلَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ تَنزِيلًا,"Mention - O Messenger - the day when the sky will split apart to reveal thin white clouds, and the angels will be sent down to the plains of the gathering in abundance due to their large number."
The real sovereignty will belong to Ar-Rahman. How grievous will be the day for the infidels!,25,25,ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَكَانَ يَوْمًا عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَسِيرًا,"Kingdom, which is the true and established kingdom, on the Day of Judgment will be for the Merciful, may He be glorified. That day will be difficult for the disbelievers as opposed to the believers for whom it will be easy."
"The sinner will then bite his hand and say: ""Would that I had taken the road with the Prophet.",26,25,وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ ٱلظَّالِمُ عَلَىٰ يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يَٰلَيْتَنِى ٱتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ ٱلرَّسُولِ سَبِيلًا,"Mention - O Messenger - the day the evildoer on account of leaving out following the Messenger (peace be upon him) will bite his own hand out of regret and say, ‘If only I had followed the Messenger and what he brought from his Lord, and I had taken a path with him to salvation.’"
"Woe alas, ah would I had not taken so-and-so as friend!",27,25,يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰ لَيْتَنِى لَمْ أَتَّخِذْ فُلَانًا خَلِيلًا,He will also say due to extreme grief cursing himself: Alas for me! If only I had not taken so-and-so disbeliever as a friend!
He led me astray from the Warning after it had come to me. Satan always betrays man.,28,25,لَّقَدْ أَضَلَّنِى عَنِ ٱلذِّكْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَنِى وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ خَذُولًا,"This disbelieving friend led me away from the Qur’ān after it reached me through the Messenger. Satan has always been one who betrays man often. When some difficulty comes on him, he renounces him."
"The prophet will say: ""O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.""",29,25,وَقَالَ ٱلرَّسُولُ يَٰرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ مَهْجُورًا,"The Messenger will say on that day complaining about the condition of his people: O my Lord! My people, to whom You sent me, left this Qur’ān and ignored it."
Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.,30,25,وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوًّا مِّنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ هَادِيًا وَنَصِيرًا,"Similar to the harm and preventing others from your path that you - O Messenger - encountered from your people, I had assigned to every Prophet before you an enemy from among the evildoers of his people. Your Lord is a sufficient guide, who guides to the truth, and He is a sufficient helper, who will help you against your enemy."
"The unbelievers say: ""Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?"" It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute. So We enunciated it by steps and distinctly.",31,25,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ جُمْلَةً وَٰحِدَةً كَذَٰلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِۦ فُؤَادَكَ وَرَتَّلْنَٰهُ تَرْتِيلًا,"Those who disbelieved in Allah said, ‘Why was the Qur’ān not sent down to him all at once instead of in bits and pieces?’ I sent the Qur’ān bit by bit to strengthen your heart - O Messenger - by its revelation time after time. I revealed it bit by bit to you to make it easy for you to understand and memorise it."
There is not an example they advance to which We do not give you a right answer and a better explanation.,32,25,وَلَا يَأْتُونَكَ بِمَثَلٍ إِلَّا جِئْنَٰكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَحْسَنَ تَفْسِيرًا,The idolaters do not bring to you - O Messenger - any point that they propose except that I bring to you the true and firm response to it and I bring to you something that is better explained.
"Those who will be pushed faces forward into Hell will be in a worse position, farther away from the path.",33,25,ٱلَّذِينَ يُحْشَرُونَ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَانًا وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا,Those who will be driven on the Day of Judgment being dragged on their faces to Hell. Such people are in the worst place because their place will be Hell and they are on the worst path because their path is the path of disbelief and deviation.
"We gave Moses the Book, and made his brother Aaron his minister,",34,25,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَجَعَلْنَا مَعَهُۥٓ أَخَاهُ هَٰرُونَ وَزِيرًا,"I gave Moses the Torah and appointed his brother, Aaron, as a Messenger to help him."
"Then We told them: ""Go to the people who have rejected Our signs."" Then We annihilated them completely.",35,25,فَقُلْنَا ٱذْهَبَآ إِلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَدَمَّرْنَٰهُمْ تَدْمِيرًا,"So I said to them: Go, both of you, to Pharaoh and his people who denied My signs. So they fulfilled our instruction and went to them and invited them to Allah’s Oneness, but they denied them and I then destroyed them completely on account of their denial."
"We had drowned the people of Noah when they had accused the apostles of lies, and turned them into an example for men. We have prepared a painful punishment for the wicked.",36,25,وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُوا۟ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَغْرَقْنَٰهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ ءَايَةً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"The people of Noah, too: when they rejected the Messengers by rejecting Noah (peace be upon him), I destroyed them by drowning them in the ocean, and I made their destruction a sign of My Power to eliminate the wrongdoers. I have prepared a painful punishment on the Day of Judgment for the wrongdoers."
"(As for) 'Ad, Thamud and the people of ar-Rass, and many generations in between them,",37,25,وَعَادًا وَثَمُودَا۟ وَأَصْحَٰبَ ٱلرَّسِّ وَقُرُونًۢا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ كَثِيرًا,"I also destroyed the Ad, the people of Hud, and the Thamud, the people of Salih. I destroyed the people of the Well and I destroyed many communities between these three."
"We administered warnings to each of them, and then destroyed them completely.",38,25,وَكُلًّا ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ ٱلْأَمْثَٰلَ وَكُلًّا تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيرًا,"To each of these who were destroyed I had described the destruction of the previous communities and the reasons for it so that they take heed, and each of them I completely destroyed because of their disbelief and stubbornness."
They must have surely passed by the town on which We had rained the terrible rain of ruin. How could they not have seen it? Still they do not dread the Resurrection.,39,25,وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا۟ عَلَى ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِىٓ أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ ٱلسَّوْءِ أَفَلَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ يَرَوْنَهَا بَلْ كَانُوا۟ لَا يَرْجُونَ نُشُورًا,These rejecters from your people in their travel to the Levant have come by the town of people of Lot on which stones had rained down as a punishment for their immoral behaviour so that they make take heed. Were they blind to this town and did they not see it? No! Instead they do not expect to be raised from the dead and taken to account thereafter.
"When they see you they take you only in jest: ""Is this the one whom God has sent as messenger?",40,25,وَإِذَا رَأَوْكَ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلَّا هُزُوًا أَهَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى بَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولًا,Whenever these rejecters meet you - O Messenger - they ridicule you by saying mockingly and in denial:   Is this the one Allah has sent as a Messenger to us?
"He would have surely turned us away from our gods if we had not adhered to them."" They will know soon who is farther away from the path when they see the punishment!",41,25,إِن كَادَ لَيُضِلُّنَا عَنْ ءَالِهَتِنَا لَوْلَآ أَن صَبَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا,"He almost led us astray from the worship of our gods. If we had not stood so firmly by their worship, he would have turned us away from it by his arguments and proofs. They will soon come to know, when they see the punishment in their graves and on the Day of Judgement, who is furthest from the path - is it them or he - and they will come to know which of them is astray."
Have you considered him who takes his own lust for his god? Can you stand a surety for him?,42,25,أَرَءَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُۥ هَوَىٰهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلًا,Have you seen - O Messenger - the person who made his desire a god and followed it! Will you be a guardian over him to bring him back to faith and prevent him from disbelief?
Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are no better than cattle; in fact they are farther astray from the path.,43,25,أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا,"Rather, do you - O Messenger - think that most of those whom you call towards Allah’s Oneness and obedience, hear with acceptance or understand the arguments and proofs? They are just like cattle in terms of their hearing, comprehension and understanding. Rather, they are further from the path than cattle are."
Have you not seen how your Lord lengthens out the shadow? He could have kept it motionless if He liked. Yet We make the sun its pilot to show the way.,44,25,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ ٱلظِّلَّ وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَجَعَلَهُۥ سَاكِنًا ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا ٱلشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلًا,"Have you - O Messenger - not seen how your Lord extends the shade on the surface of the earth. If He had willed to make it stand still without moving He could have done so. Then I made the sun an indicator for it, becoming long and short in accordance to it."
"Then We draw it back to Us, withdrawing it little by little.",45,25,ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَٰهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضًا يَسِيرًا,Then I retracted the shade by reducing it gradually little by little in accordance to the height of the sun.
"It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.",46,25,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا وَٱلنَّوْمَ سُبَاتًا وَجَعَلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ نُشُورًا,It is Allah who has made the night like a garment to cover you and cover all things. It is He who made sleep a rest that you could enjoy from your occupation. It is He who made the day a time when you go out to your work.
It is He who sends the winds with auspicious news in advance of His benevolence; and We send pure water down from the sky,47,25,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ بُشْرًۢا بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِۦ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً طَهُورًا,It is He who sent the winds as heralds of good news of the fall of rain which is His Mercy to His servants. I sent down from the sky rain water that is pure which they use to purify themselves.
"To quicken a region that was dead, and to give it as drink to animals We have created and to men in plenty.",48,25,لِّنُحْۦِىَ بِهِۦ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتًا وَنُسْقِيَهُۥ مِمَّا خَلَقْنَآ أَنْعَٰمًا وَأَنَاسِىَّ كَثِيرًا,"So that I can revive by means of the water that comes down a barren land that has no vegetation by causing various types of plants to grow and spreading greenery on it, and to give that water as a drink to the many animals and people I have created."
And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect; yet most men disdain everything but denial and thanklessness.,49,25,وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَٰهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُوا۟ فَأَبَىٰٓ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ إِلَّا كُفُورًا,"I have explained in various ways in the Qur’ān, the arguments and proofs so that they might take heed, but most people persist in their rejection and denial of the truth."
Had We pleased We could have raised a warner in every town.,50,25,وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَبَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ نَّذِيرًا,"If it had been My will, I would have sent a Messenger to every town, to warn them of Allah’s punishment. But I did not will that. I only sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a Messenger to all people."
"So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort.",51,25,فَلَا تُطِعِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ وَجَٰهِدْهُم بِهِۦ جِهَادًا كَبِيرًا,So do not follow the disbelievers in their demands for you to be soft with them and in the proposals that they put forward. Strive against them with this Qur’ān that is revealed to you a mighty struggle by being patient over their harm and tolerating difficulties in calling them to Allah.
"It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh (and) sweet, the other brine (and) bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them.",52,25,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا,"It is Allah, may He be glorified, who merged the water of the two bodies of flowing water. He mixed the sweet and the salty, and put a barrier and dividing line between them that prevents them from intermingling."
"It is He who created man from water, then gave him consanguinity and affinity. Your Lord is omnipotent.",53,25,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ بَشَرًا فَجَعَلَهُۥ نَسَبًا وَصِهْرًا وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ قَدِيرًا,It is He who created human beings from the semen of men and women. By creating human beings He established the relationship of kinship by blood and relationship by marriage. Your Lord is all powerful and Nothing is outside His ability. It is through His Power that He created man from the semen of a man and woman.
And yet they worship besides God what cannot bring them gain or do them harm. The unbeliever has always been an auxiliary against his Lord.,54,25,وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱلْكَافِرُ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِۦ ظَهِيرًا,"Yet instead of Allah, the disbelievers worship idols that can neither benefit them, if they follow them, nor harm them, if they go against them. The disbeliever has always followed Satan in that which angers Allah, may He be glorified."
Yet We have not sent you but to give good tidings and to warn.,55,25,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا,"I sent you - O Messenger - only to give good news to those who follow Allah, by having faith and doing righteous actions, and to warn those who go against Him, by committing disbelief and sin."
"Tell them: ""I do not ask any recompense of you for this other than (urging) whoever likes may take the way to his Lord.""",56,25,قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِلَّا مَن شَآءَ أَن يَتَّخِذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِۦ سَبِيلًا,"Say, O Messenger: I am not asking for any reward for conveying the message. But anyone of you who wishes to take a path towards Allah’s pleasure by spending, then let him do so."
"Have trust in God the Living, who will never die, and sing His hallelujas; for He is well aware of the sins of His creatures.",57,25,وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْحَىِّ ٱلَّذِى لَا يَمُوتُ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِۦ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرًا,"Put your trust - O Messenger - in all of your affairs in Allah, the Living and Everlasting who never dies, declare His purity and celebrate His praise, may He be glorified. He knows the sins of His servants well enough. Nothing of that is hidden from Him and He will recompense them for the same."
He created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans then assumed His authority. He is the benevolent: Ask those who are well-informed.,58,25,ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ فَسْـَٔلْ بِهِۦ خَبِيرًا,"The One who created the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and then established Himself on the throne, in a meaning that is befitting for His Majesty. He is the Merciful, so ask then - O Messenger - about Him, One who is aware, and that is Allah - the One who knows everything and from Whom nothing is hidden."
"When you say to them: ""Bow before Ar-Rahman,"" they say: ""What is Ar-Rahman? Should we adore whoever you ask us to?"" And their aversion increases further.",59,25,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ قَالُوا۟ وَمَا ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ أَنَسْجُدُ لِمَا تَأْمُرُنَا وَزَادَهُمْ نُفُورًا,"When it is said to the disbelievers: Prostrate to the Merciful, they say: We will not prostrate to the Merciful. What is the Merciful? We do not know or acknowledge Him. Should we prostrate to what you tell us when we do not know Him?! His instruction to them to prostrate to Him only puts them further away from having faith in Allah."
"Blessed is He who placed in the heavens constellations of stars, and placed a burning lamp in it and the luminous moon.",60,25,تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ بُرُوجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَٰجًا وَقَمَرًا مُّنِيرًا,"Blessed is He Who made stations in the heavens for the planets and the moving stars, Who made in the sky a sun that radiates light, and Who made a moon that illuminates the earth with the light of the sun that it reflects."
It is He who made the night and day an alternation for him who cares to reflect and be grateful.,61,25,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا,"It is Allah who made the night and day follow and replace each other, for anyone who wishes to take a lesson from Allah’s signs and come onto the right path, or wishes to be grateful to Allah for His favours."
"Devotees of Ar-Rahman are those who walk with humility on the earth, and when they are addressed by the ignorant, say: 'Peace;""",62,25,وَعِبَادُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ هَوْنًا وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ ٱلْجَٰهِلُونَ قَالُوا۟ سَلَٰمًا,"The servants of the Merciful are the believers who walk humbly on the earth with dignity, and when the foolish address them they do not retaliate in the same manner but they tell them something that saves them from their evil."
And those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their Lord;,63,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَبِّهِمْ سُجَّدًا وَقِيَٰمًا,"Those who spend the night prostrating on their foreheads and standing on their feet, praying to Allah."
"Who say: ""O our Lord, avert from us the torment of Hell: Its punishment is surely continuous.",64,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا ٱصْرِفْ عَنَّا عَذَابَ جَهَنَّمَ إِنَّ عَذَابَهَا كَانَ غَرَامًا,"Those who say in their prayer to their Lord: Our Lord, remove from us the punishment of Hell, for the punishment of Hell is perpetual and everlasting for those who die as disbelievers."

Who are neither prodigal nor miserly in their spending but follow a middle path;,66,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ لَمْ يُسْرِفُوا۟ وَلَمْ يَقْتُرُوا۟ وَكَانَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ قَوَامًا,"They are those whom when they spend their wealth do not go to the limit of extravagance in their spending, nor do they restrict their spending to only those whom they have to spend on such as themselves and others, but their spending is balanced between wastefulness and niggardliness."
"Who do not invoke any god apart from God, who do not take a life which God has forbidden except for a cause that is just, and do not fornicate -- and any one who does so will be punished for the crime,",67,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَدْعُونَ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِى حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُونَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَامًا,"Those who do not call on any other deity besides Allah, may He be glorified, nor kill any person, whose killing Allah has prohibited except for that which Allah has allowed such as the killing of a murderer, renegade or a married adulterer, nor commit adultery. Whoever does these major sins will face the punishment for the sin he has committed on the Day of Judgement."
"Whose punishment will be doubled on the Day of Judgement, and he will live for ever in disgrace,",68,25,يُضَٰعَفْ لَهُ ٱلْعَذَابُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَيَخْلُدْ فِيهِۦ مُهَانًا,"The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement, and he will remain in the punishment, disgraced and humiliated."
"Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right, for whom God will turn evil into goodness, for God is forgiving and kind.",69,25,إِلَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَٰلِحًا فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُبَدِّلُ ٱللَّهُ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ حَسَنَٰتٍ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"But those who repent to Allah and do good deeds that indicate the sincerity of their repentance, then Allah will change the evil deeds of such people into good ones. Allah is Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent and He is Merciful towards them."
"Whosoever repents and does the right, will have turned back to God by way of repentance;",70,25,وَمَن تَابَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَإِنَّهُۥ يَتُوبُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَتَابًا,"Those who repent to Allah and prove the sincerity of their repentance by doing good deeds and giving up sins, their repentance is one that is accepted."

"Who, when reminded of their Lord's revelations, do not fall for them like the deaf and blind;",72,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّوا۟ عَلَيْهَا صُمًّا وَعُمْيَانًا,"Those who, when reminded of Allah’s signs that are heard and seen, do not turn a deaf ear to the signs that are heard and do not turn a blind eye to the signs that are seen."
"And those who say: ""O Lord, give us comfort in our spouses and children, and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path.""",73,25,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَٰجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّٰتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ وَٱجْعَلْنَا لِلْمُتَّقِينَ إِمَامًا,"Those who say in their prayer to their Lord: Our Lord, give us from our spouses and offspring those who will be the coolness of our eyes due to their piety and steadfastness on the truth.

"Say: ""My Lord is not concerned on your account if you do not pray to Him. You have surely done with denying; soon will come the inevitable judgement.",76,25,قُلْ مَا يَعْبَؤُا۟ بِكُمْ رَبِّى لَوْلَا دُعَآؤُكُمْ فَقَدْ كَذَّبْتُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَكُونُ لِزَامًۢا,"Say - O Messenger, to the disbelievers who persist in their disbelief: My Lord will never care about you because of some benefit that He gets from your obedience. If it were not because He calls you for your benefit He would not have cared about you. Now since you rejected that which the Messengers brought from your Lord, the recompense for such rejection will be inseparable from you."
TA SIN MIM.,0,26,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ طسٓمٓ,Ṭā Sīn Mīm The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
These are the verses of the perspicuous Book.,1,26,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Those are the verses of the Qur’ān that makes the truth clear from falsehood.
You may perhaps wear out your heart because they do not come to belief.,2,26,لَعَلَّكَ بَٰخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلَّا يَكُونُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ,Perhaps you O Messenger because of your eagerness for their guidance are killing yourself out of fear for them that they do not believe in Allah.
"We could send down from the heavens a sign to them if We pleased, before which their heads would remain bowed.",3,26,إِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَٰقُهُمْ لَهَا خَٰضِعِينَ,"If I had wished to send down to them a miracle from the sky I would have sent it down and their necks would remain bowed in utter humility before it. But I did not wish that, in order to test them: Do they believe in the Ghaib?"
Never does a new reminder come to them from Ar-Rahman but they turn away from it.,4,26,وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ,"Whenever any new reminder that is revealed by the Merciful to these idolaters, which contain His arguments that indicate His Oneness and the truth of His prophet, they turn away from listening to it and accepting it."
Surely they have done with denying; soon will come to them the news of what they were laughing at.,5,26,فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوا۟ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنۢبَٰٓؤُا۟ مَا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"They have denied what their Messenger brought to them, but the confirmation of the information that they used to mock at will soon come to them and the punishment will fall upon them."
"Do they not see the earth, how We grow all kinds of noble things upon it?",6,26,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ كَمْ أَنۢبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ,"Do these people remain persistent in their disbelief and not look at the earth, how many different types of vegetation that is beautiful to look at and that has plenty of benefits did I grow therein!"
Verily there are signs in this; yet many of them do not believe.,7,26,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"In the earth’s growing various types of vegetation there truly is a clear sign of the Power of the One Who has made it grow to bring back the dead to life, though most of them do not have faith."
Your Lord is surely mighty and merciful.,8,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Your Lord - O Messenger - is the One Who is the Dominant who can never be overpower, and the Merciful to those of His servants who have faith."

Moses (peace be upon him) said, I fear that they will deny me and what I convey to them from you, and that my breast will be constricted because of their denial of me, and that my tongue will not be free in calling to Allah, so send Gabriel (peace be upon him) to my brother, Aaron, so that he could assist me."
"My heart is constrained, my tongue falters, so delegate Aaron;",12,26,وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلَا يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَىٰ هَٰرُونَ,"13. Moses (peace be upon him) said, I fear that they will deny me and what I convey to them from you, and that my breast will be constricted because of their denial of me, and that my tongue will not be free in calling to Allah, so send Gabriel (peace be upon him) to my brother, Aaron, so that he could assist me."

Go, you and your brother Aaron, with My signs that indicate your truthfulness. I shall be with you with My assistance and support, listening to what you say and what is said to you. Nothing of that misses us."
Go to the Pharaoh and tell him: 'We bring a message from the Lord of all the worlds,15,26,فَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولَآ إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,Go to Pharaoh and tell him: We are two Messengers sent to you by the Lord of all created things.
That you should send the children of Israel with us.',16,26,أَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,That you send the Israelites with us.

"So (Moses) cast his staff, and lo, it turned into a living serpent.",31,26,فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,So Moses threw his stick down on the ground and it suddenly became a snake for everyone to see.

And the people were also asked to assemble.,38,26,وَقِيلَ لِلنَّاسِ هَلْ أَنتُم مُّجْتَمِعُونَ,The people were told: Are you going to gather to see who wins? Will it be Moses or the magicians?
"(They said): ""We may haply follow the magicians if they are victorious.""",39,26,لَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ ٱلسَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُوا۟ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبِينَ,"If the magicians succeed over Moses, perhaps we should follow them in their religion."
"When the magicians arrived, they said to the Pharaoh: ""Is there a reward for us if we are victorious?"" --",40,26,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالُوا۟ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَٰلِبِينَ,"So when the magicians came before Pharaoh to challenge Moses, they said to him, “Will we have a tangible reward or an intangible one, if we have the upper hand over Moses?”"
"""Yes,"" he replied. ""You 'will be among the honoured.""",41,26,قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,"Pharaoh said to them, “Yes, you shall get a reward. If you are to succeed over Moses, you shall be taken as my close ones by being appointed in lofty posts.”"
"Moses said to them: ""Cast what you have to cast.""",42,26,قَالَ لَهُم مُّوسَىٰٓ أَلْقُوا۟ مَآ أَنتُم مُّلْقُونَ,"Confident in Allah’s help and in order to show clearly that whatever he possessed was not magic, Moses said to them, “Throw whatever ropes and sticks you want to!”"
"So they cast their ropes and rods, and said: ""By the glory of Pharaoh, we shall be victorious.""",43,26,فَأَلْقَوْا۟ حِبَالَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُوا۟ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ,"And so they threw down their ropes and sticks, and upon throwing them, said, “By the grandeur of Pharaoh we are going to succeed, and Moses is the one who shall be defeated!”"
"Then Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it swallowed up their conjurations.",44,26,فَأَلْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,"So Moses threw his staff and it turned into a snake, nullifying whatever magic they were casting over the people."
"Then the magicians fell prostrating in adoration,",45,26,فَأُلْقِىَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَٰجِدِينَ,"When the magicians saw Moses’s staff swallowing up whatever they had cast, they fell into prostration."
"And said: ""We (affirm and) believe in the Lord of all the worlds,",46,26,قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"They said, “I have brought faith in the Lord of all creation.”"
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron.""",47,26,رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ,“The Lord of Moses and Aaron (peace be upon them).”
"Said (the Pharaoh): ""You have come to believe in him before I gave you leave. He is surely your chief, who taught you magic. You will soon come to know: I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, and have every one of you crucified.""",48,26,قَالَ ءَامَنتُمْ لَهُۥ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ لَأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُم مِّنْ خِلَٰفٍ وَلَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Pharaoh, disapproving of the magicians’ belief, said to them, “Have you accepted Moses as being true, before I gave you permission to do so? Indeed, Moses is your mentor who has taught you magic; you have all collaborated to exile the people of Egypt from its lands, and you will soon see what punishment I inflict upon you. I shall cut off a hand and leg of each of you from opposite sides, and crucify you all on palm trunks, sparing no one.”"
"They said: ""There will be no harm. We shall return to our Lord.",49,26,قَالُوا۟ لَا ضَيْرَ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,"The magicians said to Pharaoh, “There is no big deal in the crucifixion and maiming you threaten us with in this world, because your punishment will end, while we shall return to our Lord who shall enter us into His everlasting mercy.”"
"We certainly hope our Lord will forgive our sins as we are the first to believe.""",50,26,إِنَّا نَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لَنَا رَبُّنَا خَطَٰيَٰنَآ أَن كُنَّآ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"“Due to us being the first ones to bring faith in Moses, we hope greatly that Allah erases the sins we have committed in the past.”"
"We said to Moses: ""Travel by night with My creatures. You will surely be pursued.""",51,26,وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِىٓ إِنَّكُم مُّتَّبَعُونَ,"And I revealed to Moses commanding him to march the Israelites out at night, because Pharaoh and his people would pursue them, forcing them back."
"Then the Pharaoh sent announcers to the cities,",52,26,فَأَرْسَلَ فِرْعَوْنُ فِى ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَٰشِرِينَ,"So when Pharaoh came to know of the Israelites escaping, he sent some of his army into the cities, rallying the rest of the armies."
"(Proclaiming): ""Surely they are a small band (of fugitives).",53,26,إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ,"Pharaoh said, undermining the Israelites, “Indeed, these people are very few in number.”"
They are always harassing us.,54,26,وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ,And they will do things which will incite us against them.
"But we are a fully accounted army.""",55,26,وَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَٰذِرُونَ,"Indeed, we are alert and prepared for them."
"So We made them leave the gardens and springs of water,",56,26,فَأَخْرَجْنَٰهُم مِّن جَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,"So I took Pharaoh and his people out of the land of Egypt, which had abundant gardens, flowing streams and wealth."
And treasures and agreeable mansions.,57,26,وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ,It also had treasures of wealth and beautiful dwellings.
Thus it was; and We made the children of Israel possess them.,58,26,كَذَٰلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَٰهَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"As I took Pharaoh and his people out of it, I made the Israelites inherit it."
But they pursued them at sunrise.,59,26,فَأَتْبَعُوهُم مُّشْرِقِينَ,Pharaoh and his people caught the trail of the Israelites at sunrise.
"When the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other, the people of Moses said: ""We shall certainly be overtaken.""",60,26,فَلَمَّا تَرَٰٓءَا ٱلْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَٰبُ مُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ,"So when the two groups came into view of each other, Moses’s people said, “we are definitely going to be captured!” When Pharaoh and his people drew closer to Moses and his people, such that each person was in view of the other on the opposite side, Moses’s people said, “Indeed, Pharaoh and his people will catch up with us and we are powerless against them.”"
"Moses replied: ""By no means. My Lord is with me. He will show me the way.""",61,26,قَالَ كَلَّآ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ,"Moses said to his people: “It is not as you have imagined it to be, for My Lord is with me supporting and helping me. He shall guide and show me the path to salvation.”"
"We commanded Moses: ""Smite the sea with your staff."" And it parted, and every parting was like a lofty mountain.",62,26,فَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنِ ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَٱنفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَٱلطَّوْدِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"And so I revealed to Moses commanding him to strike the sea with his staff, which he did. The sea parted, turning into twelve paths: the same number as the tribes of the Israelites, and each parted segment was like a great mountain in its grandeur and stability, such that no water flowed from it."
Then We brought the others to that place.,63,26,وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ ٱلْءَاخَرِينَ,"I made Pharaoh and his people draw closer until they entered the sea, thinking that the path was traversable."
"We delivered Moses and every one with him,",64,26,وَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُۥٓ أَجْمَعِينَ,And I saved Moses and whoever was with him from the Israelites; none from among them perished.
And We drowned the others.,65,26,ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا ٱلْءَاخَرِينَ,I then destroyed Pharaoh and his people by drowning them in the sea.
"Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.",66,26,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, in the parting of the sea for Moses, his salvation from Pharaoh and Pharaoh’s destruction, is a miracle proving the truthfulness of Moses. The majority of those with Pharaoh were not believers, they were rejecters."
Indeed your Lord is mighty and merciful.,67,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
Relate the news of Abraham to them.,68,26,وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ,O Messenger! Recite unto them the story of Abraham.
"When he asked his father and his people: ""What do you worship?""",69,26,إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِۦ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ,"When he said to his father Azar and his people, “What do you worship instead of Allah?”"
"They replied: ""We worship idols and are devoted to them.""",70,26,قَالُوا۟ نَعْبُدُ أَصْنَامًا فَنَظَلُّ لَهَا عَٰكِفِينَ,"His people said to him, “I worship idols, whose worship I remain firm upon and hold fast to.”"
"(Abraham) asked: ""Do they hear when you call them?",71,26,قَالَ هَلْ يَسْمَعُونَكُمْ إِذْ تَدْعُونَ,"Abraham said to them, “Do the idols hear your prayers when you supplicate to them?”"
"Or do they benefit you, or do you harm?""",72,26,أَوْ يَنفَعُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَضُرُّونَ,"“Or do they benefit you if you feed them, or harm you if you disobey them?”"
"They said: ""No. But we found our fathers doing so.""",73,26,قَالُوا۟ بَلْ وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا كَذَٰلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ,"They said, They do not hear us when we supplicate to them, nor do they benefit us when we feed them, nor harm us if we disobey them. However, the reality is that we found our forefathers doing that, so we follow them."
"He said: ""Have you considered what you have been worshipping,",74,26,قَالَ أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ,"Abraham said, “Have you contemplated over and realised what idols you actually worship instead of Allah?”"
You and your fathers?,75,26,أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلْأَقْدَمُونَ,“And what your forefathers before used to worship?”
Yet they are my enemies except the Lord of all the worlds,76,26,فَإِنَّهُمْ عَدُوٌّ لِّىٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,“Because they are all my enemies; they are all false except for the Lord of all creation.”
"Who created me and showed me the way,",77,26,ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَنِى فَهُوَ يَهْدِينِ,“The one who created me and it is He who will guide me to the best of this world and the Hearafter.”
"Who gives me food and drink,",78,26,وَٱلَّذِى هُوَ يُطْعِمُنِى وَيَسْقِينِ,“The being who alone feeds me when I am hungry and gives me drink when I am thirsty.”
"And heals me when I am sick,",79,26,وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ,"“And when I am ill, He alone cures me from illness; there is no healer for me except Him.”"
"Who will make me die, then give me life again,",80,26,وَٱلَّذِى يُمِيتُنِى ثُمَّ يُحْيِينِ,“The being who alone will cause me to die when my lifespan expires and will resurrect me after I die.”
"And who, I hope, will condone my faults on the Day of Judgement.",81,26,وَٱلَّذِىٓ أَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لِى خَطِيٓـَٔتِى يَوْمَ ٱلدِّينِ,“The being in who alone I hope will forgive my sins on the day of requital.”
"O Lord, give me wisdom and admit me among the righteous,",82,26,رَبِّ هَبْ لِى حُكْمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِى بِٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Abraham, supplicating to his Lord, said, “O my Lord! Grant me a deep understanding of religion and join me up with the pious prophets who came before me, by entering me into paradise with them.”"
"And uphold my name with posterity,",83,26,وَٱجْعَل لِّى لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,And grant me a true reputation of honour with the generations after me.
And put me among the inheritors of Paradise.,84,26,وَٱجْعَلْنِى مِن وَرَثَةِ جَنَّةِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,And make me from among those who inherit the dwellings of paradise wherein your believing servants shall reside in luxury; grant me residence in them.
Forgive me and my father: He was surely among those who went astray.,85,26,وَٱغْفِرْ لِأَبِىٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,"And forgive my father. Indeed, he was one of those who deviated from the truth due to idolatry. Abraham supplicated on behalf of his father before it became clear to him that he was from among the people of hell. When that became clear to him, he proclaimed his disassociation with him and no longer supplicated for him."
"And do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised from the graves,",86,26,وَلَا تُخْزِنِى يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ,Do not humiliate me with punishment on the day people are resurrected to be taken to account.
The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail,87,26,يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ,On the day when the wealth he accumulated in this world shall not benefit nor his children that used to support him.
"But to him who comes to God with a tranquil heart.""",88,26,إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى ٱللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ,"Except for the one who brings a perfect heart: one free of idolatry, hypocrisy, ostentation and arrogance. That is because he would have benefitted from his wealth which was spent in the path of Allah and his children, who would pray for him."
Paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path;,89,26,وَأُزْلِفَتِ ٱلْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Paradise will be brought nearer to those who were mindful of their Lord, by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions."
And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray.,90,26,وَبُرِّزَتِ ٱلْجَحِيمُ لِلْغَاوِينَ,Hellfire will be exposed on the plains of resurrection for the deviants who deviated from the truth.
"They will be asked: ""Where are those you worshipped",91,26,وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ,"It will be said in rebuke to them, “Where are the idols you used to worship?”"
"Other than God? Can they save you or even save themselves?""",92,26,مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ هَلْ يَنصُرُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَنتَصِرُونَ,"“You used to worship them instead of Allah? Will they help you by preventing the punishment of Allah from you, or will they be able to help themselves?”"
They will then be thrown into Hell with those who had gone astray,93,26,فَكُبْكِبُوا۟ فِيهَا هُمْ وَٱلْغَاوُۥنَ,"Then, they will be thrown into hell one on top of the other, together with whoever they led astray."
Together with the hordes of Iblis.,94,26,وَجُنُودُ إِبْلِيسَ أَجْمَعُونَ,"The helpers of Iblīs are all satans, without exception."
Disputing among themselves they will say:,95,26,قَالُوا۟ وَهُمْ فِيهَا يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"The idolaters who worshipped other than Allah and took them as partners to Him, will say whilst arguing with those they used to worship,"
"""By God, we were plainly in error",96,26,تَٱللَّهِ إِن كُنَّا لَفِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,“By Allah we were deviant from the clear truth.”
In equating you with the Lord of all the worlds;,97,26,إِذْ نُسَوِّيكُم بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,“When we regarded you as equals to the Lord of all creation and worshipped you like we worshipped Him.”
No one but the sinners led us astray.,98,26,وَمَآ أَضَلَّنَآ إِلَّا ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,“None led us astray from the path of truth except those criminals who called us towards worshipping them instead of Allah.”
"Now we have none to intercede for us,",99,26,فَمَا لَنَا مِن شَٰفِعِينَ,"“So we have no intercessors today who shall intercede for us in front of Allah, to save us from His punishment.”"
Nor any sincere friend.,100,26,وَلَا صَدِيقٍ حَمِيمٍ,“Neither do we have a true devoted friend who will defend and intercede for u.”
"If only we could return and be among the believers!""",101,26,فَلَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"“If only we could return once more to the worldly life, so that we could be from those who believed in Allah.”"
"Verily there is a sign in this, but many of them do not believe.",102,26,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, in the aforementioned, i.e. the story of Abraham (peace be upon him) and the ultimate abode of the rejecters, is a lesson for those who take heed. Although most of them do not believe; they were rejecters of what Abraham brought from his Lord."
Verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.,103,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
The people of Noah accused the apostles of lies.,104,26,كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,The people of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers when they rejected Noah (peace be upon him).

I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.,108,26,وَمَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"“I do not seek any reward from you for what I convey to you from my Lord.

"They said: ""Should we place our trust in you when only the condemned follow you?""",110,26,قَالُوٓا۟ أَنُؤْمِنُ لَكَ وَٱتَّبَعَكَ ٱلْأَرْذَلُونَ,"His people said to him, “O Noah! Should we believe you and follow what you have brought and act upon it, whilst your followers are the lowliest of people; there are no leaders and noblemen among them?”"

I am certainly not one to drive away the believers.,113,26,وَمَآ أَنَا۠ بِطَارِدِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"“I am not going to push away these believers from my gathering in acceptance of your wished, just so that you believe.”"
"I am only a plain admonisher.""",114,26,إِنْ أَنَا۠ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,“I am only a clear warner; I warn you of the punishment of Allah.”

"He prayed: ""O Lord, verily my people accuse me of lies.",116,26,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى كَذَّبُونِ,"Supplicating to his Lord, Noah said, “O my Lord! Indeed, my nation has rejected me and not believed in what I have brought from you to be true.”"
"So adjudge between me and them conclusively, and save me and the believers who are with me.""",117,26,فَٱفْتَحْ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُمْ فَتْحًا وَنَجِّنِى وَمَن مَّعِىَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"“So judge between me and them such that they are destroyed due to their insistence on falsehood and save me and those believers who are with me, from the punishment you destroy the disbelievers with.”"
"So We delivered him and those with him in the loaded ark,",118,26,فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُۥ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلْمَشْحُونِ,"So I answered his supplication and saved him and the believers with him in the ark, which was full of people and animals."

"You construct monuments on every hill in vain,",127,26,أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ,"“Why are you building upon every elevated, overlooking place a building as a marker, unnecessarily, without any benefit in it for you in the world or the afterlife?”"
"Erect palaces (thinking) that you will live for ever,",128,26,وَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ,"“And why do you build forts and palaces as if you were to live forever in this world, never to depart from it?”"
And whenever you apply force become tyrannical.,129,26,وَإِذَا بَطَشْتُم بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ,"“And when you attack a place, you attack like tyrants, killing and with violence, showing no kindness or mercy.”"
So be fearful of God and follow me.,130,26,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,“So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commandments and refrain from that which He has prohibited. And obey me in whatever I command you with and forbid you from.”
"Fear Him who has bestowed on you what you know,",131,26,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَمَدَّكُم بِمَا تَعْلَمُونَ,“And fear the wrath of Allah who has granted you everything which you know well.”
"Gave you increase of cattle and sons,",132,26,أَمَدَّكُم بِأَنْعَٰمٍ وَبَنِينَ,"“He granted you many bounties, and granted you offspring.”"
And orchards and springs.,133,26,وَجَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,“And He granted you gardens and flowing streams.”
I fear the punishment of a terrible day for you.,134,26,إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,O my people! I fear the punishment of the great day over you: the Day of Judgement.
"They said: ""It is the same to us if you warn us or do not warn.",135,26,قَالُوا۟ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْوَٰعِظِينَ,"His people said to him, “Your warning us and not warning us is the same to us, for we shall never believe in you and will never turn away from whatever we are doing.”"
This is just a habit of antiquated people.,136,26,إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا خُلُقُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"This is nothing but the religion of the people of the past, their habits and their character."
"We are not going to be damned.""",137,26,وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ,And we are not going to be punished.
"Then they accused him of lies; so We annihilated them. Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.",138,26,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَٰهُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"They continued rejecting their prophet Hud (peace be upon him), so I destroyed them due to their rejection by a barren wind. Indeed, there is a lesson in their destruction for those who take heed. Although most of them do not believe; they were rejecters."
Yet surely your Lord is mighty and merciful.,139,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
The Thamud accused the messengers of lies.,140,26,كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,The Thamūd disbelieved in all the messenger by their rejection of Saleh (peace be upon him).
"When their brother Saleh said to them: ""Will you not take heed?""",141,26,إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ صَٰلِحٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"Remember when their brother in lineage Saleh said to them, “Will you not be mindful of Allah and leave the worship of other than Him, out of fear for Him?”"
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.,142,26,إِنِّى لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ,"“Indeed, I am a Messenger for you; Allah has sent me to you and I am trustworthy, I will not increase or decrease in that which has be revealed to me.”"
So fear God and follow me.,143,26,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,“So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commandments and refrain from that which He has prohibited. And obey me in whatever I have commanded you with and forbidden you from.”
I do not ask any recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.,144,26,وَمَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"“I do not seek any reward from you for what I convey to you from my Lord. My reward is only from Allah: the Lord of all creation, not from anyone else.”"
(Do you think) you will be left secure here,145,26,أَتُتْرَكُونَ فِى مَا هَٰهُنَآ ءَامِنِينَ,"“Do you expect to be left alone in whatever goodness and bounties you are in, in safety and without fear?”"
"In these gardens and these springs,",146,26,فِى جَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,In gardens and flowing springs.
"The fields of corn and date-palm trees with soft and tender spathes,",147,26,وَزُرُوعٍ وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ,"“Among crops and palms, the fruits of which are tender and delicate.”"
And dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously?,148,26,وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا فَٰرِهِينَ,"“And you skilfully carve out houses from the mountains, in which you then live.”"
So be mindful of God and listen to me.,149,26,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,“So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commandments and refrain from that which He has prohibited. And obey me in whatever I have commanded you with and forbidden you from.”

"They said: ""Surely you are deluded.",152,26,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسَحَّرِينَ,"His people said to him, “You are surely one of those who have been bewitched repeatedly until the magic has overpowered your intellect and driven you crazy.”"
"You are nothing but a man like us. Bring us a token if you speak the truth.""",153,26,مَآ أَنتَ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا فَأْتِ بِـَٔايَةٍ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"“You are nothing but a human like us; you do not have any privilege over us which makes you worthy of being a Messenger, so bring a sign that proves you are a Messenger if indeed you are truthful in your claim to be one.”"
"(Saleh) said: ""Here is a she-camel. She has a right of drinking water, and you have a right of drinking it on appointed turns.",154,26,قَالَ هَٰذِهِۦ نَاقَةٌ لَّهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ,"After Allah had given Saleh a sign that was in the form of the she-camel which Allah extracted from the rock, he said to them, “This is a she-camel which can be seen and felt, it will have a share of the water as you also have a known share. It will not drink on the day scheduled for you, neither shall you make your livestock drink on the day scheduled for it.”"
"Do not treat her unkindly or the punishment of a grievous day will fall on you.""",155,26,وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوٓءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"“Do not harm it by way of hitting it or cutting its legs, otherwise the punishment of Allah will come upon you and destroy you on a distressing day, due to the affliction that comes down on it.”"
"But they hamstrung her; and on the morrow were repentant,",156,26,فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ نَٰدِمِينَ,"So they agreed upon cutting its legs, and the most wretched from them all did the act. Then they regretted the deed they had committed because of realising that the punishment was about to befall them inevitably. However, regret after seeing the punishment is of no benefit."
"For they were seized by the torment. Verily there was a sign in this, but most of them did not believe.",157,26,فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"So the punishment that they were promised seized them: it was an earthquake accompanied by a scream. Indeed, in the aforementioned, i.e. the story of Saleh and his people, is a lesson for those who take heed. Although most of them do not believe; they were rejecters."
Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.,158,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
The people of Lot accused the messengers of lies.,159,26,كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ لُوطٍ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,The people of Lut disbelieved in all the messengers by their rejection of Lut (peace be upon him).
"When their brother Lot said to them: ""Will you not take heed?",160,26,إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ لُوطٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"Remember when their brother in lineage Lot said to them, Will you not be mindful of Allah by leaving idolatry, fearing Him?"
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.,161,26,إِنِّى لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ,"“Indeed, I am a Messenger for you; Allah has sent me to you and I am trustworthy, I will not increase or decrease in that which has be revealed to me.”"
So fear God and listen to me.,162,26,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,“So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commandments and refrain from that which He has prohibited. And obey me in whatever I command you with and forbid you from.”
I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.,163,26,وَمَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"“I do not seek any reward from you for what I convey to you from my Lord. My reward is only from Allah: the Lord of all creation, not from anyone else.”"
Why do you go for males unlike all other creatures,164,26,أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلذُّكْرَانَ مِنَ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,“Do you seek sexual gratification from males?”
"Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you? But you are a people who exceed the bounds.""",165,26,وَتَذَرُونَ مَا خَلَقَ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُم مِّنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُم بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ عَادُونَ,“Whilst neglecting sexual gratification from the front passages of your wives Allah has created for you? You have indeed transgressed the limits of Allah by this detestable absurdity.”
"They said: ""If you do not desist, O Lot, you will be expelled (from the city).""",166,26,قَالُوا۟ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهِ يَٰلُوطُ لَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُخْرَجِينَ,"His people said to him, “O Lot! If you do not stop forbidding us from this act and rebuking us over it, you and those with you shall be exiled from our city.”"
"(Lot) said: ""I am disgusted with your actions,""",167,26,قَالَ إِنِّى لِعَمَلِكُم مِّنَ ٱلْقَالِينَ,"Lot said to them, “Indeed, I am one of those who dislike and hate this act of yours.”"
"(And prayed:) ""O Lord, save me and my family from what they do.""",168,26,رَبِّ نَجِّنِى وَأَهْلِى مِمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,"Supplicating to his Lord, he said, “O my Lord! Save me and my family from whatever punishment is going to afflict these people because of the evil they commit.”"
So We saved him and his whole family,169,26,فَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥٓ أَجْمَعِينَ,So I accepted his supplication and saved him and his whole family.
Except one old woman who remained behind.,170,26,إِلَّا عَجُوزًا فِى ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"Except for his wife because she was a disbeliever, so she ended up being one of those who perished and were destroyed."
"Then We destroyed the rest of them,",171,26,ثُمَّ دَمَّرْنَا ٱلْءَاخَرِينَ,"Then, after Lot and his family left the city of Sodom, I severely destroyed his people who remained behind."
And rained on them a shower (of Stones). How terrible was the rain (that fell) on those who had been warned!,172,26,وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَرًا فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,"I rained down on them stones from the sky, just like we send down the rain. Disgraceful was the rain that befell these people, whom Lot used to warn of the punishment of Allah if they continued committing their evil acts."
"Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe.",173,26,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, in the aforementioned, i.e. the punishment that descended on the people of Lot because of their sexual indecency, is a lesson for those who take heed. Although most of them do not believe; they were rejecters."
Yet surely your Lord is mighty and powerful.,174,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
The people of the Wood too called the messengers liars.,175,26,كَذَّبَ أَصْحَٰبُ لْـَٔيْكَةِ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,The people of the Thicket close to Madyan rejected the Messengers when they rejected their prophet Shu‘ayb (peace be upon him).
"When Shu'aib said to them: ""Will you not take heed?",176,26,إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ شُعَيْبٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"When their prophet Shu‘ayb said to them, “Will you not be mindful of Allah by leaving idolatry, fearing Him?”"
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.,177,26,إِنِّى لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ,"“Indeed, I am a Messenger for you; Allah has sent me to you and I am trustworthy, I will not increase or decrease in that which has be revealed to me.”"
So fear God and follow me.,178,26,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,“So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commandments and refrain from that which He has prohibited. And obey me in whatever I have commanded you with and forbidden you from.”
I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.,179,26,وَمَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"“I do not seek any reward from you for what I convey to you from my Lord. My reward is only from Allah: the Lord of all creation, not from anyone else.”"
Give full measure and do not cheat;,180,26,أَوْفُوا۟ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْمُخْسِرِينَ,"“When you sell to the people, measure for them properly. Do not be people who reduce measure when selling to people.”"
Weigh on an even balance.,181,26,وَزِنُوا۟ بِٱلْقِسْطَاسِ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمِ,"“And when you weigh for others, weigh with properly functioning scales.”"
"And do not withhold from people what belongs to them, and do not corrupt the land;",182,26,وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا۟ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,“And do not violate the rights of people and cause excessive corruption on Earth by committing sins.”
"And fear Him who created you and all the earlier people.""",183,26,وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلْجِبِلَّةَ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"“And be mindful of the one who created you and created the previous nations, by fearing that He sends down His punishment upon you.”"
"They said: ""Surely you are deluded.",184,26,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسَحَّرِينَ,"Shu‘ayb’s people said to him, “You are definitely one of those who have been victim of sorcery repeatedly, until it has overpowered your intelligence and driven you crazy.”"
"You are nothing but a man like us, and we think you are a liar.",185,26,وَمَآ أَنتَ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"“You are only a human like us and have no privilege over us, so how could you be a Messenger? I think of you only to be a liar in your claim to be a Messenger.”"
"But in case you are speaking the truth, then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us.""",186,26,فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"“So if you are truthful in your claim, cause a piece of sky to fall upon us.”"
"(Shu'aib) said: ""My Lord knows well what you are doing.""",187,26,قَالَ رَبِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Shu‘ayb said to them, “My Lord is better aware of the idolatry and sins you commit; none of your actions are hidden from Him.”"
"But they denied him, and We seized them with the torment of the Day of Shadowing (when the cloud had rained down fire). It was indeed the torment of a terrible day!",188,26,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ ٱلظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,They continued rejecting him and so a grave punishment afflicted them by way of a cloud appearing after a severely hot day. It rained a fire upon them that burned them. The day they were destroyed was an extremely horrific day.
"Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe.",189,26,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, in the aforementioned i.e. the destruction of the people of Shu‘ayb, is a lesson for those who take heed. Although most of them do not believe; they were rejecters."
Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.,190,26,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the almighty who takes retribution from His enemies, yet merciful to those of them who repent."
"And this (Qur'an) is a revelation from the Lord of all the worlds,",191,26,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Indeed, this Qur’ān that was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), was revealed by the Lord of all creation."
Which the trusted spirit descended with,192,26,نَزَلَ بِهِ ٱلرُّوحُ ٱلْأَمِينُ,It was revealed through the trustworthy Gabriel (peace be upon him).
To (communicate) to your heart that you may be a warner,193,26,عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنذِرِينَ,O Messenger! He revealed it upon your heart so that you become one of the Messengers who warn the people and make them fearful of the punishment of Allah.
In eloquent Arabic.,194,26,بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ,He revealed it in clear Arabic language.
This is (indicated) in the Books of earlier people.,195,26,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَفِى زُبُرِ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,And indeed this Qur’ān has been referenced in the previous Books; the previous divine books have given glad tidings of it.
Was it not a proof for them that the learned men of Israel knew about this?,196,26,أَوَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ ءَايَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُۥ عُلَمَٰٓؤُا۟ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"Was it not a sign of your truthfulness for these people who reject you, that the scholars of the Israelites like Abdullah bin Salām, knew the reality of what has been revealed to you?"
Had We revealed it to a man of obscure tongue,197,26,وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَٰهُ عَلَىٰ بَعْضِ ٱلْأَعْجَمِينَ,Had we revealed this Qur’ān upon one of the non-Arabs who do not speak Arabic.
"And he had recited it to them, and they had not believed (it would have been different).",198,26,فَقَرَأَهُۥ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"And then they were to read it to them, they would not become believers, because they would say, “I do not understand it!” So they should praise Allah that it was revealed in their language."
Thus do We cause (unbelief) to enter the hearts of sinners.,199,26,كَذَٰلِكَ سَلَكْنَٰهُ فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Likewise, we placed rejection and disbelief in the hearts of the criminals because of their wrongdoing."
They will not believe it until they behold the painful punishment.,200,26,لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلْأَلِيمَ,"They do not change from the state of disbelief they are in, and will not believe until they see the painful punishment."
"It will come upon them unawares, and they will not comprehend it.",201,26,فَيَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,This punishment will come to them suddenly and unexpectedly.
"Then will they say: ""Can we be given respite?""",202,26,فَيَقُولُوا۟ هَلْ نَحْنُ مُنظَرُونَ,"So when the punishment will come upon them suddenly, they will say out of immense grief, “Will we be given respite to repent to Allah?”"
Do they wish Us then to hasten the punishment?,203,26,أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,"Do these disbelievers seek our punishment hastily, saying, “We will never believe in you until you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, just as you claim it will.”"
"Just think: If We let them enjoy (the good things of life) for a few years more,",204,26,أَفَرَءَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَٰهُمْ سِنِينَ,"206. O Messenger! So tell me, How will it if I was to let these disbelievers enjoy the bounties for a lengthy period of time and then the punishment they were promised came to them after that period of enjoyment."
"And then what they were promised comes upon them,",205,26,ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يُوعَدُونَ,"206. O Messenger! So tell me, How will it if I was to let these disbelievers enjoy the bounties for a lengthy period of time and then the punishment they were promised came to them after that period of enjoyment."
Of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them?,206,26,مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يُمَتَّعُونَ,"What worldly bounties which they were enjoying, would benefit them? Verily, those bounties would have finished, and they will not be of any use."
Never have We destroyed a habitation till We had sent admonishers to them,207,26,وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ,I did not destroy any nation except they were warned by sending messengers to them and revealing books.
To warn. For We are never unjust.,208,26,ذِكْرَىٰ وَمَا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"Which served as admonitions and warnings for them. I was not oppressive by punishing them after establishing an excuse, by sending them Messengers and books."
The devils did not bring it down:,209,26,وَمَا تَنَزَّلَتْ بِهِ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ,The satans did not come down with this Qur’ān upon the heart of Muhammad (peace be upon him);
"They are not worthy of it, nor have they power.",210,26,وَمَا يَنۢبَغِى لَهُمْ وَمَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,it is permissible that they come down with it onto his heart. They are not even capable of doing that.
They have been precluded from hearing it.,211,26,إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ,"They are incapable of doing so because they have been cut off from its place in the heavens, so how could they reach it and then bring it down?"
"So call on no other god but God, lest you are condemned to torment;",212,26,فَلَا تَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُعَذَّبِينَ,"So do not worship any deity with Allah and ascribe it to Him. Otherwise, you will be one of those who shall be punished."
"And warn your near relations,",213,26,وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ ٱلْأَقْرَبِينَ,"O Messenger! Warn your closest relatives from your people, in order of strength in relationship, lest the punishment of Allah does not afflict them if they remain upon idolatry."
And take those believers under your wing who follow you.,214,26,وَٱخْفِضْ جَنَاحَكَ لِمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"And be kind in action and speech, out of mercy and gentleness, to those believers who follow you."
"If they do not obey you, tell them: ""I am not responsible for what you do.""",215,26,فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"If they disobey you and do not accept proclaiming the oneness of Allah and His obedience you command them with, then say to them, “I proclaim innocence from the idolatry and sins you commit.”"
"Have trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,",216,26,وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,And place your reliance in all your affairs upon the Almighty who takes retribution from His enemies and is merciful to whoever repents to Him from them.
"Who watches you when you get up,",217,26,ٱلَّذِى يَرَىٰكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ,"The being, may He be glorified, who sees you when you stand towards prayer."
And your movements among those who bow in homage to God.,218,26,وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"And He sees you changing from posture to posture among those who pray. Nothing is hidden from Him, neither any action you undertake, nor anyone else undertakes."
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.,219,26,إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Indeed, He is the hearer of the Qur’ān you recite and remembrance you do in your prayer, knower of your intention."
Should I tell you on whom the devils descend?,220,26,هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَىٰ مَن تَنَزَّلُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ,"“Shall I inform you who the satans actually come down to, as you have claimed that they come down with the Qur’ān?”"
"They come down to every mendacious sinner,",221,26,تَنَزَّلُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ,"“They come down to every fortune-teller, who is a perpetual liar, sinner and disobeyer.”"
Who listens to you (for spreading rumours); but most of them are liars.,222,26,يُلْقُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ كَٰذِبُونَ,"“The satans eavesdrop on the exalted assembly of angels and then convey that information to their fortune-teller friends. The majority of fortune tellers are liars; if they are truthful in one statement, they tell a hundred lies with it."
"As for the poets, only those who go astray follow them.",223,26,وَٱلشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ ٱلْغَاوُۥنَ,"And as for the poets that you claim Muhammad (peace be upon him) is from, those deviant from the path of guidance and steadfastness follow them and relate whatever poetry they say."
"Have you not seen that they wander distract in every valley,",224,26,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ,"O Messenger! Do you not see that one of the manifestations of their errors is that they wander around in all the valleys, sometimes immersed in praise, sometimes in criticism, and many times in other issues!"
"And they say what they do not do,",225,26,وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"And indeed they lie, saying, “I did such and such”, while they did not actually do it."
"Except those who believe and do the right, and remember God a great deal, who retaliate only when they have been wronged. Yet the oppressors will now come to know through what reversals they will be overthrown!",226,26,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَذَكَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَٱنتَصَرُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُوا۟ وَسَيَعْلَمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ,"Except for those poets who have faith, perform good deeds, remember Allah abundantly and take retribution from the enemies of Allah after they have oppressed, like Hassān bin Thābit may Allah be pleased with him. Those who committed wrong by ascribing partners to Allah and showing hostility to His servants, will soon know what their place of return will be: they will return to a great place and a meticulous accounting."
"TA SIN. THESE are the verses of the Qur'an, and collection of explicit laws,",0,27,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ طسٓ تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,Ta Sin. These are the verses of the Qur’ān and a clear book. The discussion on similar letters has passed in the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah. These verses which are revealed to you are verses of the Qur’ān and a clear book in which there is no confusion. Whoever ponders upon it will know that it is from Allah.
"A guidance and good tidings for the believers,",1,27,هُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"These verses guide to the truth and direct towards it, and give glad-tidings to those who bring faith in Allah and His Messengers."
"Who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and believe with certainty in the life to come.",2,27,ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,"Those who perform prayer in the most complete manner and give Zakat of their wealth by spending it on its recipients, and they are convinced of the reward and punishment in the afterlife."
"We make their deeds attractive to those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may wander in perplexity.",3,27,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ زَيَّنَّا لَهُمْ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ فَهُمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"The disbelievers who do not bring faith in the afterlife and the reward and punishment therein - I adorned their bad deeds for them so they continued in doing them, thus they are confused without finding their way towards what is right or guidance."
"They are those who will suffer the worst chastisement in this life, and will be the greatest losers in the life to come.",4,27,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَهُمْ سُوٓءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرُونَ,"Such people will suffer in the worldly life through trials and humiliation and in the Hereafter they suffer the greatest loss, losing themselves and their families on the Day of Judgement and entering Hell forever."
You have been conveyed the Qur'an from One all-wise and all-knowing.,5,27,وَإِنَّكَ لَتُلَقَّى ٱلْقُرْءَانَ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ عَلِيمٍ,"O Messenger, you are receiving this Qur’ān which is being revealed to you from one who is Wise in His creating, managing and legislating, and Knowing, with nothing of the interests of His servants being hidden from Him."
"(Remember) when Moses said to his family: ""I see a fire. I shall bring you news from it, or bring an ember that you may warm yourselves.""",6,27,إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِأَهْلِهِۦٓ إِنِّىٓ ءَانَسْتُ نَارًا سَـَٔاتِيكُم مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ ءَاتِيكُم بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Moses said to his family: “I have seen a fire. I shall bring some news from it, from the person who lit it to guide us towards the path, or I shall I bring you a flame of fire taken from it, in the hope that you will light a fire from it to warm yourselves from the cold”."
"But when he reached it, a voice called out: ""Blessed is He who is in the fire and all around it. Praised be God, the Lord of all the worlds.",7,27,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِىَ أَنۢ بُورِكَ مَن فِى ٱلنَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَسُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Then when he reached the place of the fire that he saw, Allah called unto him that the one in the fire and the angels surrounding it are blessed."
"O Moses, I am that God, the mighty and all-wise.",8,27,يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّهُۥٓ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Allah said to him: “O Moses, it is I, Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in My creating, managing and legislating."
"Throw down your staff."" When he saw it wriggling like a serpent he turned his back and fled without turning (to look). ""O Moses,"" (said the voice), ""be not fearful. Surely those sent as messengers do not fear in My presence,",9,27,وَأَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَا تَخَفْ إِنِّى لَا يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,"And throw down your staff”. Moses obeyed. Then when Moses saw it moving and shaking like a snake, he fled turning his back to it and did not return. So Allah said to him: “Do not be scared of it. The Messengers do not fear snakes or anything else in my presence."
Except those who do some wrong but afterwards do good to make up for the wrong. And I am forgiving and merciful.,10,27,إِلَّا مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْنًۢا بَعْدَ سُوٓءٍ فَإِنِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"However, whoever wrongs himself by committing a sin, then repents after that, I am Forgiving to him, Merciful to him."
"Put your hand in the bosom of your shirt; it will come out white without any blemish. This will be one of nine tokens for the Pharaoh and his people, who are a wicked lot indeed.""",11,27,وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوٓءٍ فِى تِسْعِ ءَايَٰتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا فَٰسِقِينَ,"And put your hand in the opening of your shirt; it will come out after entering it white like snow without being due to leprosy, as part of nine signs which testify to your truthfulness. Along with the hand, they are: the staff, famine, loss of fruits, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood, towards Pharaoh and his people. They were a people left the obedience of Allah by disbelieving in him."
"And when Our signs came as distinct proofs, they said: ""This is only magic.""",12,27,فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا مُبْصِرَةً قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"So when these clear and apparent signs of Mine with which I aided Moses came to them, they said: “These signs which Moses has brought are clear magic”."
"And they denied them out of malice and pride, though in their hearts they believed that they were true. So see how was the end of evil-doers!",13,27,وَجَحَدُوا۟ بِهَا وَٱسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْمًا وَعُلُوًّا فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"They disbelieved in these miracles and did not accept them, despite being convinced they are from Allah, due to their wrongdoing and their arrogance from the truth. So contemplate, O Messenger, how was the outcome of those who cause corruption on earth, due to their disbelief and disobedience; I destroyed them and eradicated all of them."
"We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they said: ""All praise be to God who has favoured us over many of His creatures who believe.""",14,27,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُۥدَ وَسُلَيْمَٰنَ عِلْمًا وَقَالَا ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى فَضَّلَنَا عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"I granted David and his son Solomon knowledge, part of which was the language of birds. David and Solomon said, in gratitude to Allah: “All praise is for Allah who has given us virtue over many of his believing servants, through prophethood and subjugating the jinns”."
"Solomon was heir to David, and he said: ""O people, we have been taught the language of Tair, and have been given of everything. This is a clear favour indeed.""",15,27,وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَٰنُ دَاوُۥدَ وَقَالَ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ ٱلطَّيْرِ وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"And Solomon inherited from his father in prophethood, knowledge and kingdom, and he said, relating Allah’s favour on him and his father: “O people, Allah has taught us the language of birds and given us of everything He gave to the prophets and kings. This which He has given us is the clear, apparent grace”."
"His armies of jinns and men and Tair assembled, formed into ranks, (and marched)",16,27,وَحُشِرَ لِسُلَيْمَٰنَ جُنُودُهُۥ مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ وَٱلطَّيْرِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,"And for Solomon his armies of men, jinns and birds were gathered, and they were being led orderly."
"Till they reached the Valley of Naml. Said the lady of Naml: ""O Naml, go into your dwellings lest Solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares.""",17,27,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَتَوْا۟ عَلَىٰ وَادِ ٱلنَّمْلِ قَالَتْ نَمْلَةٌ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّمْلُ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ مَسَٰكِنَكُمْ لَا يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَٰنُ وَجُنُودُهُۥ وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"They were being led until when they came to the valley of ants (a place in the Levant), one of the ants said: “O ants, enter your homes so that Solomon and his armies do not destroy you whilst they do not know of you, because if they know of you they will not trample you”."
"(Solomon) smiled, amused at her speech, and said: ""O Lord grant me that I should be grateful for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and do good things of Your pleasing; and admit me among Your righteous devotees by Your grace.""",18,27,فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكًا مِّن قَوْلِهَا وَقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِىٓ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَٰلِحًا تَرْضَىٰهُ وَأَدْخِلْنِى بِرَحْمَتِكَ فِى عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"When Solomon heard it saying this, he smiled due to this statement of his and he said, calling unto his Lord: “O Lord, enable me and inspire me to be grateful for Your favour which You gave to me and My parents, and enable me to do good actions which please you, and enter me amongst Your righteous servants”."
"When he reviewed the Tair, he said: ""How is it I do not see Hud-hud? Is he absent?",19,27,وَتَفَقَّدَ ٱلطَّيْرَ فَقَالَ مَا لِىَ لَآ أَرَى ٱلْهُدْهُدَ أَمْ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَآئِبِينَ,"And Solomon took attendance of the birds but did not see the hoopoe, so he said: “What is with me that I do not see the hoopoe? Has something stopped me seeing it or is it from the absentees?”"
"I will punish him severely, or cut his throat, unless he bring a valid excuse.""",20,27,لَأُعَذِّبَنَّهُۥ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا أَوْ لَأَا۟ذْبَحَنَّهُۥٓ أَوْ لَيَأْتِيَنِّى بِسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"He said when its absence became clear to him: “I shall punish it severely, or I shall slaughter it as a punishment for being absent, unless it brings a clear proof to prove its excuse for absence”."
"But he was not long in coming, and reported: ""I have been around where you have not been. I come from Saba with positive news.",21,27,فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ فَقَالَ أَحَطتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِۦ وَجِئْتُكَ مِن سَبَإٍۭ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ,"The hoopoe remained absent for a short while. Then when it came, it said to Solomon (peace be upon him): “I discovered what you did not discover, and I have brought to you from Sheba true news in which there is no doubt."
"I found a woman reigning over them, and she has been favoured with everything; and she has a throne that is magnificent.",22,27,إِنِّى وَجَدتُّ ٱمْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ وَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. I found a woman who rules them, and this woman has been given of all means of strength and kingdom, and she has a large throne on which she manages the affairs of her people."
"I found that she and her people worship the sun in place of God, for Satan has made their deeds look attractive to them and has turned them away from the Path, so they do not find the way",23,27,وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لَا يَهْتَدُونَ,"I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided. I found this woman and I found her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has beautified for them the actions of idolatry and sins they are on, so he has turned them away from the path of truth, and thus they are not guided to Him."
"To worship God who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and is cognisant of what you hide and what you disclose.",24,27,أَلَّا يَسْجُدُوا۟ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى يُخْرِجُ ٱلْخَبْءَ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ,"[And] so they do not prostrate to Allah, who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare. Satan has beautified for them their actions of idolatry and sins, so that they do not prostrate to Allah alone, who brings the rain which He has hidden in the skies and the plants in the earth, and He knows the actions you hide and those you make apparent, none of this being hidden from Him."
"God: There is no god but He, the Lord of the glorious throne.""",25,27,ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"Allah - there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne. Allah - there is no true god besides, Lord of the Great Throne”."
(Solomon) said: 'We shall see if you speak the truth or you are a liar.,26,27,قَالَ سَنَنظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"[Solomon] said, ""I will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars. Solomon (peace be upon him) said to the hoopoe: “I shall see if you are truthful in what you claim or were you amongst the liars”."
"Take this letter from me, and deliver it to them and withdraw, then see what reply they give in return.""",27,27,ٱذْهَب بِّكِتَٰبِى هَٰذَا فَأَلْقِهْ إِلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَٱنظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُونَ,"Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them and see what [answer] they will return."" So Solomon wrote a letter and handed it to the hoopoe, and said to it: “Take this letter of mine, and give it to the people of Saba and hand it over to them, and step aside from them so you can hear what they say discuss regarding it”."
"(The Queen said): ""O nobles, a venerable letter has been delivered to me.",28,27,قَالَتْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلَؤُا۟ إِنِّىٓ أُلْقِىَ إِلَىَّ كِتَٰبٌ كَرِيمٌ,"She said, ""O eminent ones, indeed, to me has been delivered a noble letter. The queen received the letter and said: “O noble ones, a noble magnificent letter has been given to me."
"It is from Solomon, and (says): 'In the name of Allah, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim.",29,27,إِنَّهُۥ مِن سُلَيْمَٰنَ وَإِنَّهُۥ بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,"Indeed, it is from Solomon, and Indeed, it reads: 'In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. The content of this letter which has been sent by Solomon and which begins with: “In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.” is:"
"Do not rise against me, but come to me in submission.'",30,27,أَلَّا تَعْلُوا۟ عَلَىَّ وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ,"Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission [as Muslims].' "" Do not be arrogant, and come to me obediently and submitting to what I call you towards, namely declaring Allah’s Oneness and leaving associating partners with Him which you are involved in, as you worshipped the sun alongside Him”."
"."" Advise me, O nobles,"" she said ""in this matter. I do not decide any thing until you concur.""",31,27,قَالَتْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلَؤُا۟ أَفْتُونِى فِىٓ أَمْرِى مَا كُنتُ قَاطِعَةً أَمْرًا حَتَّىٰ تَشْهَدُونِ,"She said, ""O eminent ones, advise me in my affair. I would not decide a matter until you witness [for] me."" The queen said: “O noble ones and leaders, explain to me the right course in my matter. I am not going to decide a matter until you come to me and present your opinions regarding it”."
"They said: ""We are men of valour, and brave fighters. It is for you to decide. So consider what you should command.""",32,27,قَالُوا۟ نَحْنُ أُو۟لُوا۟ قُوَّةٍ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ وَٱلْأَمْرُ إِلَيْكِ فَٱنظُرِى مَاذَا تَأْمُرِينَ,"They said, ""we are men of strength and of great military might, but the command is yours, so see what you will command."" The nobles from her people said: “We are people of great power and strong might in warfare, but the opinion is what you think, so see what you will command us to do; we are able to carry it out”."
"She said: ""Surely when kings enter a city they destroy it and despoil the honour of its nobility. So will they do (to us).",33,27,قَالَتْ إِنَّ ٱلْمُلُوكَ إِذَا دَخَلُوا۟ قَرْيَةً أَفْسَدُوهَا وَجَعَلُوٓا۟ أَعِزَّةَ أَهْلِهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَكَذَٰلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ,"She said, ""Indeed, kings - when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled. And thus do they do. The queen said: “When kings enter any city, they ruin it by the killing, seizing and looting they carry out, and they make its leaders and nobles disgraced, after the honour and protection they enjoyed. And this is how kings always behave when they conquer the people of a city, to plant the seeds of fear and awe in the hearts of the masses.”"
"But I will send them a gift and see what the envoys bring back (in return).""",34,27,وَإِنِّى مُرْسِلَةٌ إِلَيْهِم بِهَدِيَّةٍ فَنَاظِرَةٌۢ بِمَ يَرْجِعُ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,"But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the Messengers will return."" I am sending a gift to the sender of the letter and his people, and I shall see what the messengers bring after sending this gift”."
"So, when the envoys came to Solomon he said: ""Do you wish to increase my wealth? Yet what God has given me is better than what He has given you. No. Be gratified in your present.",35,27,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ سُلَيْمَٰنَ قَالَ أَتُمِدُّونَنِ بِمَالٍ فَمَآ ءَاتَىٰنِۦَ ٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّآ ءَاتَىٰكُم بَلْ أَنتُم بِهَدِيَّتِكُمْ تَفْرَحُونَ,"So when her messenger and his helpers who were with him came carrying the present to Solomon, he criticised them for sending the present, saying: “Are you providing me with wealth to turn me away from you? The prophethood, kingdom and wealth Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. In fact, it is you who are rejoicing on the short-term riches of the world you have been given”."
"Go back to them. We shall soon come with our armies which they will not be able to face. We shall drive them out of (the land) with ignominy, and they will be humbled.""",36,27,ٱرْجِعْ إِلَيْهِمْ فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّهُم بِجُنُودٍ لَّا قِبَلَ لَهُم بِهَا وَلَنُخْرِجَنَّهُم مِّنْهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَهُمْ صَٰغِرُونَ,"Solomon (peace be upon him) said to her messenger: “Return to them with the present you brought, for we will come to her and her people with armies they will not have the power to face, and we will remove them from Sheba disgracefully after the honour they were in, if they do not come to me obediently”."
"He (then) said (to his courtiers): ""O you nobles, is there any one who can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?""",37,27,قَالَ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلَؤُا۟ أَيُّكُمْ يَأْتِينِى بِعَرْشِهَا قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ,"Solomon (peace be upon him) said, addressing the prominent people of his kingdom: “O eminent ones, which one of you will bring me her royal throne before they come to me obediently?”"
"A crafty jinn said: ""I will bring it before you rise from your seat, for I am strong and trustworthy.""",38,27,قَالَ عِفْرِيتٌ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَن تَقُومَ مِن مَّقَامِكَ وَإِنِّى عَلَيْهِ لَقَوِىٌّ أَمِينٌ,"A rebellious jinn replied saying: “I shall bring her throne to you before you stand from the gathering you are in. I am strong enough to carry it, and can be trusted on what it contains, so I will not take anything of it”."
"But one who had knowledge of the letter, said: ""I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye."" When Solomon saw it before him, (he said): ""This is by the grace of my Lord that He may test me whether I am grateful or I am thankless. Yet if one is grateful, he is grateful for himself, and if one is thankless, then surely my Lord is unconcerned and magnanimous.""",39,27,قَالَ ٱلَّذِى عِندَهُۥ عِلْمٌ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَن يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهُ مُسْتَقِرًّا عِندَهُۥ قَالَ هَٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّى لِيَبْلُوَنِىٓ ءَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّى غَنِىٌّ كَرِيمٌ,"A pious knowledgeable man in the presence of Solomon who had knowledge of the scripture, part of which was the greatest name of Allah which Allah accepts prayers when supplicated through, said: “I shall bring her throne to you before your glance returns to you, by praying to Allah to bring it”. So he prayed, and Allah answered his prayer. When Solomon saw her throne placed before him, he said: “This is from the grace of my Lord, to test me whether I am grateful for his favours or ungrateful? Whoever is grateful to Allah, the benefit of his gratefulness will only return to him, because Allah is self sufficient, in no need of anything, is not benefitted or harmed by the gratefulness of His servants. And whoever rejects the favours of Allah and does not thank Him for them, my Lord is self-sufficient, in no need of being shown gratitude, and Generous. Part of His generosity is granting those who deny them”."
"(Turning to his nobles) he said: ""Change the appearance of her throne. Let us see if she is rightly guided, or is not guided at all.""",40,27,قَالَ نَكِّرُوا۟ لَهَا عَرْشَهَا نَنظُرْ أَتَهْتَدِىٓ أَمْ تَكُونُ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَهْتَدُونَ,Solomon (peace be upon him) said: “Change her royal throne from its original form: we shall see: is she guided to recognising it is her throne or will she be from those who are not guided to recognising their own things?”
"When she arrived, they asked her: ""Is your throne like this?"" She said: ""As though this is it. We had come to have knowledge and already submitted.""",41,27,فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ قِيلَ أَهَٰكَذَا عَرْشُكِ قَالَتْ كَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ وَأُوتِينَا ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهَا وَكُنَّا مُسْلِمِينَ,"So when the queen of Sheba came to Solomon, it was said to her to test her: “Is this how your throne is?” She answered according to the question: “It is as though it was that”. Allah has granted us knowledge before her and we were submitting to Allah’s order and obeying Him."
"She was (in fact) turned away by what she worshipped other than God, for she came of an unbelieving people.",42,27,وَصَدَّهَا مَا كَانَت تَّعْبُدُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهَا كَانَتْ مِن قَوْمٍ كَٰفِرِينَ,"And she was turned away from the Oneness of Allah by what she used to worship besides Allah, in following her people and blindly imitating them. She was amongst the people who disbelieve in Allah, so she was a disbeliever like them."
"She was invited to enter the court. When she saw it, she took it for a sheet of water, and (pulling up her skirts) uncovered her legs. (Solomon) told her: ""This is paved with tiles of glass."" ""O Lord,"" she said, ""I have wronged myself, and I submit to the Lord of all the worlds with Solomon.""",43,27,قِيلَ لَهَا ٱدْخُلِى ٱلصَّرْحَ فَلَمَّا رَأَتْهُ حَسِبَتْهُ لُجَّةً وَكَشَفَتْ عَن سَاقَيْهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُۥ صَرْحٌ مُّمَرَّدٌ مِّن قَوَارِيرَ قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّى ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِى وَأَسْلَمْتُ مَعَ سُلَيْمَٰنَ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"It was said to her: “Enter the palace” which was like a plane surface. When she entered it, she thought it was water and uncovered her shins to enter it. Solomon (peace be upon him) said: “It is a palace which has been made smooth with glass”. He called her to Islam, so she accepted what he called her towards, saying: “O Lord, I wronged myself by worshipping others besides You, and I have submitted with Solomon to Allah, Lord of all created things”."
"We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh (who said): ""Worship God."" But they were divided into two groups disputing with one another.",44,27,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَٰلِحًا أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ فَإِذَا هُمْ فَرِيقَانِ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"And I sent toThamud their brother in lineage Salih (peace be upon him) saying “Worship Allah alone”, but they became two groups after his calling them: a believing group and the other disbelieving, arguing over who is on the truth."
"(Saleh) said: ""O people, why do you wish to hasten evil rather than good? Why not ask for God's forgiveness? You may well be forgiven.""",45,27,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لِمَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ لَوْلَا تَسْتَغْفِرُونَ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"Salih (peace be upon him) said: “why do you seek to hasten the punishment instead of seeking Allah's mercy? Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah for your sins, in the hope that he will forgive you?”"
"They said: ""You betoken evil, and those with you."" (Saleh) replied: ""The evil you presage can only come from God. In reality you are a people under trial (for your own inauspiciousness).""",46,27,قَالُوا۟ ٱطَّيَّرْنَا بِكَ وَبِمَن مَّعَكَ قَالَ طَٰٓئِرُكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تُفْتَنُونَ,"His people said to him, in stubbornness from the truth: “I consider you and the believers with you a bad omen”. Salih (peace be upon him) said: “The birds that you drive away due to the difficulties that which has afflicted you from what you dislike and you attribute as a bad omen is actually decreed from Allah and He has knowledge of that."
"There were in that city nine persons who spread disorder in the land, and did not reform.",47,27,وَكَانَ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ يُفْسِدُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ,"And in the city of Hijr there were nine men who would cause corruption on earth through disbelief and sins, and they would not reform in it through faith and good actions."
"They said: ""Let us swear by God that we will attack Saleh and his family at night, and later tell his heirs: 'We did not see his family destroyed, and we speak the truth.'""",48,27,قَالُوا۟ تَقَاسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ لَنُبَيِّتَنَّهُۥ وَأَهْلَهُۥ ثُمَّ لَنَقُولَنَّ لِوَلِيِّهِۦ مَا شَهِدْنَا مَهْلِكَ أَهْلِهِۦ وَإِنَّا لَصَٰدِقُونَ,"They said to one another: “Each one of you should swear by Allah that we will go to him and the believers with him at night, then we will kill them and then say to the one responsible for avenging his blood: ‘We were not present at the murder of Salih or the murder of his followers, and we are truthful in what we have said’”."
They hatched up the plot; We also planned without their knowledge.,49,27,وَمَكَرُوا۟ مَكْرًا وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْرًا وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"And they secretly made a plan to destroy Salih and his followers amongst the believers, and I also made a plan to help him, save him from their plan and to destroy the disbelievers from his people, whilst they did not know that."
Now see the end of their machinations: We destroyed them and their entire people.,50,27,فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَٰهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"So contemplate, O Messenger, what was the outcome and end of their planning and scheming; did they achieve what they were intending? No. In fact, I totally uprooted them with a punishment from Myself so they were all destroyed."
So these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities. Verily there is a sign in this for those who understand.,51,27,فَتِلْكَ بُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةًۢ بِمَا ظَلَمُوٓا۟ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"So those are their homes whose walls have fallen on their roofs, and they have remained empty of inhabitants, due to their wrongdoing. In the punishment which has afflicted them due to their wrongdoing is a lesson for people who believe, as they are the ones who take lessons from the signs."
We deliver those who believe and take heed for themselves.,52,27,وَأَنجَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ يَتَّقُونَ,"And I saved those who believed from the people of Salih (peace be upon him), and they used to be mindful of Allah by carrying out His orders and refraining from His prohibitions."
"(Remember) Lot, when he said to his people: ""Why do you indulge in obscenities when you know (it is evil)?",53,27,وَلُوطًا إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِۦٓ أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,"O Messenger, remember Lot when he said to his people, reprimanding them and criticising them: “Do you come to the indecent act, which is sodomy in your meetings, openly watching one another?"
"You lust after men in place of women. You are indeed a stolid people.""",54,27,أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ,"Do you come to men lustfully, leaving the women, not intending chastity or children but only to fulfil animalistic lust? But rather you are a people ignorant of what is necessary upon you, namely faith, purity and staying far from sins”."
"His people had no answer except saying: ""Expel the family of Lot from your city. They are a people who would (rather) be pure!""",55,27,فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوٓا۟ أَخْرِجُوٓا۟ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ,"But his people did not have an answer besides their saying: “Remove the family of Lot from your city. They are a people who want to stay pure from dirt and impurity”. They said this to mock the family of Lot who would not join them in the immoral acts they used to commit, but rather they would condemn them for committing them."
So We saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind.,56,27,فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱمْرَأَتَهُۥ قَدَّرْنَٰهَا مِنَ ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"So we saved him and his family, except for his wife, who was decreed to be from those who remained behind for the punishment, so she may be from those who were destroyed."
And We rained down on them a shower (of stones). How ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned (but warned in vain)!,57,27,وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَرًا فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,"And I rained stones of baked clay on the people of Lot. Dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned such as the people of Lot who did not respond to him, and in fact remained on their disbelief, misguidance and committing immorality."
"Say: ""All praise be to God, and peace on those of His creatures whom He has chosen."" Is God better or those they associate with Him --",58,27,قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَسَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰ عِبَادِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱصْطَفَىٰٓ ءَآللَّهُ خَيْرٌ أَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"O Messenger, say: “All praise is for Allah for his favours, and peace from him on His Messengers whom He chose to convey His religion”. Is Allah, the true god in whose Hand is the kingdom of everything, better or the gods which the idolaters worship, which do not possess benefit or harm?"
"Who created the heavens and the earth, who sends down water from the sky for you, with which He causes graceful gardens to grow? It was not in your power to make trees germinate. Is there any other god along with God. In fact they are a people who turn away (from the truth).",59,27,أَمَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنۢبَتْنَا بِهِۦ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنۢبِتُوا۟ شَجَرَهَآ أَءِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ,"Is He not best who created the heavens and the earth without any precedent, and He sent down for you, O people, rainwater from the sky, then He grew for you gardens of beauty? It was not for you to grow the trees of these gardens, due to your being unable to do that. So it is Allah who grew them. Is there any true god alongside Allah? No, but rather they are a people who turn away from the truth, so they unjustly make the creation equal with the Creator."
"Who then made the earth a habitable place, and made the rivers (flow) in its valleys and dales, and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and kept a barrier between two bodies of water? Is there any other god along with God? In reality most of them do not know.",60,27,أَمَّن جَعَلَ ٱلْأَرْضَ قَرَارًا وَجَعَلَ خِلَٰلَهَآ أَنْهَٰرًا وَجَعَلَ لَهَا رَوَٰسِىَ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ حَاجِزًا أَءِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Is He not best who made the earth firm and still, without it shaking those on it, and made within it rivers that flow, and made for it firm mountains, and made between two seas, salty and sweet, a barrier which stops the salty mixing with the sweet so that it does not spoil it and then making it unsuitable for drinking? Is there a true god alongside Allah who can make all that happen? No, but most of them do not know. Had they known, they would not have associated any of Allah’s creation with Him as a partner."
"Who hears the cry of the anguished (soul) when it calls to Him, and relieves its suffering? And who made you trustees on the earth? Is there any other god along with God? How little it is that you reflect!",61,27,أَمَّن يُجِيبُ ٱلْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ ٱلسُّوٓءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ ٱلْأَرْضِ أَءِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Is He not best who responds to the call of the distressed when he calls upon Him, seeking for his harm to be removed, and who removes what the human finds bad such as illness and poverty, and who makes you deputies on earth, succeeding one another generation after generation? Is there a true god alongside Allah who makes all that happen? No. Little do you take heed and consider."
Who then really shows you the way in the darkness of the desert and the sea? And who sends breezes bringing news of His benevolence? Is there any other god along with God? He is far too exalted for what they associate with Him!,62,27,أَمَّن يَهْدِيكُمْ فِى ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَن يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ بُشْرًۢا بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِۦٓ أَءِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ تَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"Is He not best who guides you in the darkness of the land and the darkness of the sea through the signs and stars He fixes for you, and who sends winds to give good news of close rainfall through which He will have mercy on His servants? Is there a true god alongside Allah who makes all that happen and decrees it? Allah is purified and far removed from the partners the creation associate with Him"
"Who creates first then reverts it? And who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth? Is there any other god along with God? Tell them: ""Bring your proof, if you are truthful.""",63,27,أَمَّن يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ وَمَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَءِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Is He not best who begins the creation in the wombs, stage after stage, then He will restore it after He gives it death, and who provides you from the sky with water that descends from its direction, and who provides you from the earth with plants He makes grow therein? Is there a true god alongside Allah who makes all that happen and decrees it? Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “Bring your proofs for the idolatry you are on, if you are true in your claim that you are on the truth”."
"Say: ""No one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unknown except God, nor can they know when they will be raised again.",64,27,قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلْغَيْبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ,"O Messenger, say: The Ghaib is not known by the angels in the heavens or the people on earth. However Allah alone is the one who knows it. And nobody in the heavens or the earth knows when they will be raised for recompense besides Allah."
"Still less do they comprehend the life to come. In fact they are in doubt about it. Still more, they are blind to it.""",65,27,بَلِ ٱدَّٰرَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهَا بَلْ هُم مِّنْهَا عَمُونَ,"But rather their knowledge in the afterlife will become complete, due to their seeing it with their own eyes after the Messengers used to inform them of it when it was unseen, but they used to deny it because they had not seen it. And they were in doubt and confusion regarding the afterlife in their worldly life, for their eyes and hearts had become blind towards it."
"Those who do not believe, say: ""When we and our fathers have turned to dust, how shall we be raised again?",66,27,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَٰبًا وَءَابَآؤُنَآ أَئِنَّا لَمُخْرَجُونَ,"Those who disbelieved said denyingly: “When we die and become dust, is it possible we will be raised alive?"
"Indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before. It is nothing but the earlier people's lore.""",67,27,لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا هَٰذَا نَحْنُ وَءَابَآؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"We were promised and our fathers were promised before that we will all be raised, but we have not seen that promise come true. This promise we were all made is nothing but lies of the former people who recorded them in their books”."
"Say: ""Travel in the land and see how (bad) was the end of sinners.""",68,27,قُلْ سِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to these deniers of the resurrection: “Travel in any direction on earth, then ponder over what was the outcome of the evildoers who denied the resurrection; I destroyed them due to their denying it”."
"Do not grieve over them, and do not be distressed by what they contrive.",69,27,وَلَا تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا تَكُن فِى ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ,"Do not grieve due to the idolaters turning away from your call nor should your bosom become tight or should you worry due to their scheming against you, for Allah is with you and He will help you against them."
"Yet they say: ""When will this promise come to pass? (Tell Us) if you speak the truth.""",70,27,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"The disbelievers amongst your people who deny the resurrection say: “When will the punishment you and the believers promise us occur, if you are true in what you claim of that?”"
"Say: ""Perhaps some of what you wish to hasten is right behind you.""",71,27,قُلْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم بَعْضُ ٱلَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,"O Messenger, say to them: “Perhaps some of the punishment you are hastily seeking has already come near”."
"Verily your Lord is gracious to men, though most men are ungrateful.",72,27,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"And your Lord, O Messenger, is graceful towards the people, as He is leaving punishing them quickly despite the disbelief and sins they are upon. However, most people do not thank Allah for the favours He gives them."
Verily your Lord knows what lies hidden in their breasts and what they disclose.,73,27,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,And your Lord knows what the hearts of His servants hide and what they make apparent. None of that is hidden from Him.
There is nothing of the hidden in the heavens and the earth that is not recorded in the luminous Book.,74,27,وَمَا مِنْ غَآئِبَةٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"And there is nothing hidden from the people in the sky nor anything hidden from them on earth except that it is in a clear book, which is the Preserved Tablet."
Indeed this Qur'an explains to the children of Israel much of what they are at variance.,75,27,إِنَّ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ يَقُصُّ عَلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ أَكْثَرَ ٱلَّذِى هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"This Qur’ān which was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) relates to the Israelites most of what they differ in, and it exposes their deviances."
It is a guidance and grace for those who believe.,76,27,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And it is a guidance and mercy for the believers who practice what it has brought.
Surely your Lord in His wisdom will decide between them. He is all-mighty and all-knowing.,77,27,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُم بِحُكْمِهِۦ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"O Messenger, your Lord will decide between the people, believers and disbelievers, on the day of judgment through His just judgment. He will have mercy on the believer and punish the disbeliever, and He is the Mighty who will take retribution from His enemies, with nobody to overpower Him, the Knowing to whom the truthful is not unclear from the liar."
So you place your trust in God. Certainly you stand on positive truth.,78,27,فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّكَ عَلَى ٱلْحَقِّ ٱلْمُبِينِ,"So trust in Allah, and rely on Him in all your affairs. You are on the clear truth."
"You cannot make the dead to listen, or the deaf to hear the call, when they have turned their backs,",79,27,إِنَّكَ لَا تُسْمِعُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَلَا تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا وَلَّوْا۟ مُدْبِرِينَ,"O Messenger, you cannot make the dead whose hearts have died to their disbelief in Allah hear, nor can you make those who have lost their hearing hear what you are calling them towards when they return turning away from you."
Nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe in Our signs and have come to peace and submission.,80,27,وَمَآ أَنتَ بِهَٰدِى ٱلْعُمْىِ عَن ضَلَٰلَتِهِمْ إِن تُسْمِعُ إِلَّا مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَهُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"And you are not one to guide those whose eyes are blind to the truth, so do not grieve over them and tire yourself. Only those will listen to your call who believe in our verses, because they submit to the orders of Allah."
"When the sentence will have been passed against them, We shall bring forth beastly brutes from the earth who will torment them, for men certainly do not believe Our signs.",81,27,وَإِذَا وَقَعَ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَخْرَجْنَا لَهُمْ دَآبَّةً مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ أَنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ كَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا لَا يُوقِنُونَ,"When the punishment becomes binding and established for them, due to their disbelief and sins, and the worst of people remain, I shall take out for them near to the Final Hour one of its greatest signs, which is a creature from the earth which will speak to them with what they understand that the people did not believe My verses which were revealed to My Prophet."
"The day We shall gather from every community a section of those who denied Our signs, and they will be brought (in separate groups),",82,27,وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ فَوْجًا مِّمَّن يُكَذِّبُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,"O Messenger, remember the day I shall gather from each of the nations a group from amongst them the leaders who used to disbelieve in our ayaat, so they can precede their followers to the fire...the first group will be held until the last group of leaders are gathered and then they will be led to the reckoning."
"So that when they come (before the Lord) He will say: ""Did you deny My signs without having understood them? Or what was it that you were doing?""",83,27,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءُو قَالَ أَكَذَّبْتُم بِـَٔايَٰتِى وَلَمْ تُحِيطُوا۟ بِهَا عِلْمًا أَمَّاذَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And their being led will continue until when they come to the place of their reckoning, Allah will say to them rebukingly: “Did you deny my signs which proved my Oneness and which comprised my sacred law, whilst you did not have proper knowledge to judge them to be false and disbelieve in them, or what was it that you were doing: believing or denying?”"
"When the sentence will have been passed upon them for their wickedness, they will not be able to say a word.",84,27,وَوَقَعَ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِم بِمَا ظَلَمُوا۟ فَهُمْ لَا يَنطِقُونَ,And the punishment will befall them due to their disbelieving in Allah and denying His ayahs. They will not speak to defend themselves due to their inability and the falsity of their proofs.
"Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear? Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.",85,27,أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا ٱلَّيْلَ لِيَسْكُنُوا۟ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَارَ مُبْصِرًا إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Do these deniers of the resurrection not see that I made the night so that they can rest in it through sleep, and I made the day bright for them so that they can see therein and then hasten towards their work? In that repeated death and the rising after it are proofs for the resurrection after death."
"The day the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified, save those whom God please, and all will appear before Him in abjectness.",86,27,وَيَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَفَزِعَ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَٰخِرِينَ,"O Messenger, remember: the day in which the angel appointed to blow the trumpet a second time will blow, then everyone in the heavens and everyone on earth will be terrified except whom Allah has excluded from being terrified, as a grace from Him. And all the creation of Allah will come to him on that day, in obedience and with humility."
"You will see the mountains and think they are firmly planted, but they will pass away like flying clouds: Artistry of God who perfected everything. He is indeed fully aware of what you do.",87,27,وَتَرَى ٱلْجِبَالَ تَحْسَبُهَا جَامِدَةً وَهِىَ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ ٱلسَّحَابِ صُنْعَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ إِنَّهُۥ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَفْعَلُونَ,"And you will see mountains on that day thinking them to be firm without moving, but they will in fact move like clouds move. It is the doing of Allah, for He is the one who makes them move. He is Aware of what you do. None of your actions are hidden from Him and He shall reward you for them."
"Whoever comes with good (deeds) will receive better than (what he had done), and be safe that day from terror.",88,27,مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُۥ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَهُم مِّن فَزَعٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ ءَامِنُونَ,"On the Day of Judgement, whoever brings faith and good deeds will gain paradise and will be safe from the horrors of that day due to Allah granting them that safety."
But whosoever comes with evil will be flung face forward into the Fire. Can you expect reward for any thing but what you do?,89,27,وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى ٱلنَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And whoever comes with disbelief and sins, for them will be the hellfire in which they will be thrown face first. It will be said to them by way of rebuke and humiliation: “Are you being requited except for the disbelief and the sins you used to commit?”"
"(Say): ""I am commanded to worship the Lord of this land He has blessed, to whom all things belong; and I am commanded to be one of those who submit,",90,27,إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ رَبَّ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْبَلْدَةِ ٱلَّذِى حَرَّمَهَا وَلَهُۥ كُلُّ شَىْءٍ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to them: “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Makkah) which He has sanctified, so no blood should be shed in it, nor should anyone be oppressed in it, nor should its game be hunted or trees cut. And to Him belongs the authority over everything. I have also been commanded to be from those who submit to Allah in obedience to Him.”"
"And to recite the Qur'an."" Whoever comes to guidance does so for himself; as for him who stays astray, tell him: ""I am only a warner.""",91,27,وَأَنْ أَتْلُوَا۟ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ فَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِى لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُنذِرِينَ,"And I have been commanded to recite the Qur’ān to people; whoever is guided by it and implements its teachings, his guidance will benefit him. But whoever deviates from its teachings, rejects them and does not implement them, say to him: “I am only one of the warners; I warn you of the punishment of Allah. and your guidance is not in my hands.”"
"Say: ""All praise be to God. He will show you His signs, and you will recognise them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you do.""",92,27,وَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ سَيُرِيكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ فَتَعْرِفُونَهَا وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Say - O Messenger: “All praise belongs to Allah for His innumerable blessings. He will show you His signs in the horizons and in yourselves; you will recognise them such that they will lead you to submitting to the truth. And your Lord is not neglectful of your actions; He is watching over them, none of them are hidden from Him and He will requite you for them.”"
TA SIN MIM.,0,28,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ طسٓمٓ,Ṭā Sīn Mīm The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
These are the verses of the illuminating Book.,1,28,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,These are the verses of a clear Qur’ān.
"We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh in all verity, for those who believe.",2,28,نَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكَ مِن نَّبَإِ مُوسَىٰ وَفِرْعَوْنَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"We recite upon you with truth, the story of Moses and Pharoah for the peopleof faith as they are the ones who will take lessons and benefit from it."
"The Pharaoh had become high and mighty in the land, and divided the people into different classes, and impoverished one class, slaying its males and sparing its women, for he was indeed a tyrant.",3,28,إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ عَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَجَعَلَ أَهْلَهَا شِيَعًا يَسْتَضْعِفُ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْهُمْ يُذَبِّحُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَيَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"Indeed Pharaoh ruled over Egypt, acting tyranically therein. He divided its people into groups and oppressing a certain group - which were the Children of Israel - killing their male children and letting the females live, to exploit and humiliate them. Indeed he was one who caused corruption on Earth through oppression, tyranny and arrogance."
"We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,",4,28,وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ ٱلْوَٰرِثِينَ,"And I wanted to bestow a favour upon the Israelites who had been oppressed by the Pharaoh in Egypt, by destroying their enemy, liberating them from the oppression, making them leaders, to be followed by those who seek the truth, and making them inheritors of Pharaoh’s kingdom in Egypt after I drowned him and his armies."
"And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them.",5,28,وَنُمَكِّنَ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَنُرِىَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَٰمَٰنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا مِنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَحْذَرُونَ,"I wanted to grant them authority on the land of Egypt by making them dominate and rule over it, showing Pharaoh and his biggest supporters - Hāmān and their armies who helped them in their rule - what they feared most, which was the loss of their kingdom at the hands of a male child from the Israelites."
"So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: ""Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle.""",6,28,وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ وَلَا تَخَافِى وَلَا تَحْزَنِىٓ إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَاعِلُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"I inspired the mother of Moses (peace be upon him) to breastfeed him until she feared that Pharaoh and his people would kill him, and when that time came, to place him in a box, cast it into the sea and not fear him drowning, being harmed by Pharaoh or even having to separate from him, as I would return him to her alive and make him one of My Messengers I send to My creation."
"Then he was picked up by the family of Pharaoh (unaware) that he would become their enemy and a cause for regret. Surely the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes were habitual sinners.",7,28,فَٱلْتَقَطَهُۥٓ ءَالُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوًّا وَحَزَنًا إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَٰمَٰنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا كَانُوا۟ خَٰطِـِٔينَ,"So she acted upon whatever I inspired her with, placing him in a box and casting it into the sea. The family of Pharaoh found him and took him in, so that Allah’s plan for Moses to become an enemy to Pharaoh by having his kingdom taken away from him and bringing him grief at his hands, comes to fruition. Indeed, Pharaoh, his minister Hāmān and their aides were sinful due to their disbelief, oppression and corruption on Earth."
"The Pharaoh's wife said: ""He will be a comfort to me and to you. Do not kill him. He may well be of some advantage to us, or we may adopt him as a son."" They were not aware (of what the future held in store).",8,28,وَقَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّتُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ لَا تَقْتُلُوهُ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَنفَعَنَآ أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُۥ وَلَدًا وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"And when Pharaoh intended to kill him, his wife said to him: “This child could be a source of happiness for me and you; do not kill him, perhaps he will benefit is by serving us, or we could adopt him as our child.” They did not know how their kingdom would end at his hands."
The mother of Moses was perturbed in the morning. Had We not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away.,9,28,وَأَصْبَحَ فُؤَادُ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ فَٰرِغًا إِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِى بِهِۦ لَوْلَآ أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"The heart of Moses’s mother forgot every worldly matter and became preoccupied with the matter of Moses, barely able to bear patience so much so that she almost expressed that it was her son, due to the immense attachment she had with him. It was only because of My strengthening her heart and granting her the ability to bear patience, that she became one of those believers who fully thrust their Lord and are patient upon what He decrees for them."
"She told his sister: ""Follow him."" So she kept an eye on him from a distance, unbeknown to them.",10,28,وَقَالَتْ لِأُخْتِهِۦ قُصِّيهِ فَبَصُرَتْ بِهِۦ عَن جُنُبٍ وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"And after she had cast him into the sea, Moses’s mother said to his sister, “Follow him so that you know what happens to him”, and so she observed him from a distance so that she was not implicated. Pharaoh and his people were not aware that she was his sister and that she was keeping an eye on him."
"We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse. So his sister said: ""Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?""",11,28,وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ ٱلْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُۥ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُۥ نَٰصِحُونَ,"By the decree of Allah, Moses refused to feed from the women. When his sister saw their eagerness to feed him, she said to them, “Shall I tell you of a household who shall feed him and look after him, who will also treat him with goodwill?”"
"Thus We restored him to his mother that she may be tranquil and not grieve, and know that the promise of God is true, though most men do not know.",12,28,فَرَدَدْنَٰهُ إِلَىٰٓ أُمِّهِۦ كَىْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا وَلَا تَحْزَنَ وَلِتَعْلَمَ أَنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"So we returned Moses to his mother, for her eyes, after seeing what they longed for, called become joyful and rest, so that she would not be grieved by separation from him, and that she would realise the promise of Allah to return him to her to have been undoubtedly true. However, many people were unaware of this promise; no one knew she was his mother."
"When he had grown up to full maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the doers of good.",13,28,وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُۥ وَٱسْتَوَىٰٓ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُ حُكْمًا وَعِلْمًا وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"When body and vigour grew stronger and peaked, completing the phase of youth, I granted him knowledge and understanding in religion. Just as I rewarded Moses for his obedience, likewise I reward those who do good in every era and place."
"He came to the city when the people were in a care-free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies. The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies. Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off. ""This is of Satan's doing,"" he said. ""He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter.""",14,28,وَدَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ عَلَىٰ حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلَانِ هَٰذَا مِن شِيعَتِهِۦ وَهَٰذَا مِنْ عَدُوِّهِۦ فَٱسْتَغَٰثَهُ ٱلَّذِى مِن شِيعَتِهِۦ عَلَى ٱلَّذِى مِنْ عَدُوِّهِۦ فَوَكَزَهُۥ مُوسَىٰ فَقَضَىٰ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّهُۥ عَدُوٌّ مُّضِلٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"Moses entered the city at a time when its inhabitants were unaware, and saw two men arguing and brawling. One was from the Israelites: Moses’s tribe, while the other was a Copt: Pharaoh’s people, who were Moses’s enemies. The one who was from the Israelites sought assistance from Moses against the Copt, so Moses struck him with a punch and because of his power, it killed him. Moses said, “This is from the adornment and deception of Satan. Indeed, Satan is a deceiving enemy of whoever follows him; he is open in his enmity. Whatever has happened here is due to his enmity and deception; he wants me to err.”"
"""O Lord,"" he prayed, ""I have done wrong, forgive me."" And God forgave him. Verily He is forgiving and kind.",15,28,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِى فَٱغْفِرْ لِى فَغَفَرَ لَهُۥٓ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Beseeching his Lord and acknowledging his action, Moses said, “O my Lord! I have wronged myself by killing this Copt, so forgive my sin.” So Allah forgave him; indeed He Forgiving to whoever repents from His servants and merciful towards them."
"(Moses) said: ""O Lord, as You have been gracious to me I will never aid the guilty.""",16,28,قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ فَلَنْ أَكُونَ ظَهِيرًا لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Moses said, “O my Lord! Due to your blessing me with the ability to repent, among other blessings, I shall never assist any criminal in their crime.”"
"In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). ""You are indeed a meddlesome fellow,"" Moses said to him.",17,28,فَأَصْبَحَ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ خَآئِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ فَإِذَا ٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَنصَرَهُۥ بِٱلْأَمْسِ يَسْتَصْرِخُهُۥ قَالَ لَهُۥ مُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّكَ لَغَوِىٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"After the incident of killing the Copt, Moses awoke in the morning anxious as to what may happen. Suddenly, the very same person who had sought his aid and assistance against an enemy Copt the previous day, was now seeking his assistance against another Copt. Moses said to him, “Indeed, you are misguided and a clear inciter!”"
"Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: ""O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker.""",18,28,فَلَمَّآ أَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِى هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَّهُمَا قَالَ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ أَتُرِيدُ أَن تَقْتُلَنِى كَمَا قَتَلْتَ نَفْسًۢا بِٱلْأَمْسِ إِن تُرِيدُ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَ جَبَّارًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا تُرِيدُ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِينَ,"So when Moses (peace be upon him) intended to strike the Copt who was his and the caller’s enemy, the Copt said: “Do you intend to kill me just like you killed another yesterday? You only wish to become a tyrant on Earth by killing people and oppressing them; you have no desire to be one of those who reconcile between those who dispute!”"
"There came a man running from the other part of the city. ""O Moses,"" he said, ""the chiefs are deliberating to kill you. Go away from the city. I wish you well.""",19,28,وَجَآءَ رَجُلٌ مِّنْ أَقْصَا ٱلْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنَّ ٱلْمَلَأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَٱخْرُجْ إِنِّى لَكَ مِنَ ٱلنَّٰصِحِينَ,"A man came rushing from the far end of the city, fearing persecution against Moses. He said, “O Moses! Indeed, the leaders of the people of Pharaoh are holding counsel regarding your killing, so leave the city. I am one of those who wish well for you and I fear that they may seize and kill you.”"
"So he left the city, fearful and hesitant, (and) prayed: ""O Lord, deliver me from these wicked people.""",20,28,فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَآئِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ قَالَ رَبِّ نَجِّنِى مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"So Moses acted according to the instruction of the well-wishing man and left the city in fear and anxiety over what may happen. He said, beseeching his Lord, “O my Lord! save me from the oppressive nation, so that they cannot harm me.”"
"Then as he turned his face to Midian, he said: ""Maybe my Lord will show me the right way.""",21,28,وَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَآءَ مَدْيَنَ قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبِّىٓ أَن يَهْدِيَنِى سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"And when he walked heading towards Madyan, he said, “I hope in my Lord that He guides me towards the best path from which I do not stray.”"
"And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a crowd of people watering (their flocks), and saw two maidens holding back (their cattle). He asked: ""What is the trouble with you?"" They said: ""We cannot water our flock till the shepherds have driven away theirs, and our father is a very old man.""",22,28,وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ ٱمْرَأَتَيْنِ تَذُودَانِ قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا قَالَتَا لَا نَسْقِى حَتَّىٰ يُصْدِرَ ٱلرِّعَآءُ وَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ,"When he reached the waterhole of Madyan he found a group of people watering their livestock. He also found two women a little distance away, stopping their livestock from the water until the rest of the people finished. Moses asked them: “Why is it that you do not water your livestock along with the rest of the people?” They said to him, “It is our habit that we arrive but do not water until the shepherds disperse, fearing mixing in with them. Our father is an aged man; he cannot water the livestock, so we are compelled to do it ourselves.”"
"So he watered (their flock), and moved into the shade and prayed: ""My Lord, I have need of whatever good you send me.""",23,28,فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا ثُمَّ تَوَلَّىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ,"So he felt pity for them and watered their livestock for them. He then took shelter in the shade and rested there, beseeching Allah and presenting his need to him, saying, “O my Lord! Indeed I am for any and every goodness you send down to me in dire need for and it is my only recourse.”"
"Then one of the (maidens) came to him walking bashfully, (and) said: ""My father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock."" So, when (Moses) came to him and told him his story, he said: ""Have no fear. You have escaped from the wicked people.""",24,28,فَجَآءَتْهُ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا تَمْشِى عَلَى ٱسْتِحْيَآءٍ قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِى يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُۥ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَصَصَ قَالَ لَا تَخَفْ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"When they went back, they informed their father of Moses, so he sent one of them to him, inviting him. She approached him walking modestly, saying, “Indeed, my father is inviting you to meet him, intending to reward you for watering our livestock for us.” When Moses came to their father and told him of his situation, he reassuringly told him, “Do not fear, for you have escaped from an oppressive nation: Pharaoh and his crowd. They have no authority over Madyan, so they will not be able to harm you.”"
"Said one of the maidens: ""O father, employ him. Surely the best (man) to employ is one who is strong and honest.""",25,28,قَالَتْ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا يَٰٓأَبَتِ ٱسْتَـْٔجِرْهُ إِنَّ خَيْرَ مَنِ ٱسْتَـْٔجَرْتَ ٱلْقَوِىُّ ٱلْأَمِينُ,"One of his two daughters said, “O my father! Hire him to shepherd our livestock for us, because he is worthy of being hired by you. He possesses strength and is trustworthy; through his strength he will be able to fulfil his responsibility, and with his trustworthiness he will safeguard whatever he is entrusted with.”"
"He said: ""I would like to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight years. And if you stay on for ten, it is up to you. I do not wish to impose any hardship on you. God willing you will find me a man of honour.""",26,28,قَالَ إِنِّىٓ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُنكِحَكَ إِحْدَى ٱبْنَتَىَّ هَٰتَيْنِ عَلَىٰٓ أَن تَأْجُرَنِى ثَمَٰنِىَ حِجَجٍ فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْرًا فَمِنْ عِندِكَ وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ سَتَجِدُنِىٓ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Addressing Moses, their father said, “Indeed, I wish to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on the condition that their dowry is your shepherding our livestock for eight years. If you extend the period to ten years, it would be a favour on your part and not obligatory upon you, because the agreement is only for eight years, so whatever exceeds that is optional. I do not wish to impose upon you anything that would put you in difficulty; Allah-willing, you will find me one of the pious ones who fulfils their promises and doesnot break their agreements.”"
"(Moses) said: ""This is (agreed) between you and me. Whichever term I fulfil, no injustice will be done to me. God is witness to our agreement.""",27,28,قَالَ ذَٰلِكَ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ أَيَّمَا ٱلْأَجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلَا عُدْوَٰنَ عَلَىَّ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said, “The agreement between us is as we agreed; whichever of the two periods I work for you, eight years or ten, I would have fulfilled my end of the deal, so do not ask me for anything above that; Allah is a witness and a guardian over what we say."
"When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain. ""Wait here,"" he said to his family; ""I have seen a fire. I may haply bring some news from there, or an ember that you may warm yourselves.""",28,28,فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلْأَجَلَ وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِۦٓ ءَانَسَ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ نَارًا قَالَ لِأَهْلِهِ ٱمْكُثُوٓا۟ إِنِّىٓ ءَانَسْتُ نَارًا لَّعَلِّىٓ ءَاتِيكُم مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,"So when Moses completed the agreed duration - either eight or ten years - and was returning with his family from Madyan to Egypt, he saw a fire towards the side of Mount Sinai. He said to his family, “Stay here. I have noticed a fire, perhaps I can bring some news to you from it, or a torch of fire with which we can light one for ourselves and get some warmth from the cold.”"
"When he drew near, a voice called out to him from the tree on the blessed spot on the right side of the valley: ""O Moses, I am verily God, the Lord of all the worlds.",29,28,فَلَمَّآ أَتَىٰهَا نُودِىَ مِن شَٰطِئِ ٱلْوَادِ ٱلْأَيْمَنِ فِى ٱلْبُقْعَةِ ٱلْمُبَٰرَكَةِ مِنَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ أَن يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ إِنِّىٓ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"So when Moses came to the fire which he had noticed, his Lord, may He be glorified, called out to him from the right of where Moses (peace be upon him) was standing, on the blessed spot near the tree: “O Moses! Indeed, I am Allah, the Lord of all creation."
"Throw down your staff."" When he saw it wriggling like a serpent, he turned about and fled without turning. ""O Moses, approach,"" (said the Voice), ""and have no fear. You will be safe.",30,28,وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يَٰمُوسَىٰٓ أَقْبِلْ وَلَا تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْءَامِنِينَ,"“And throw down your staff.” So Moses threw it down, fulfilling the command of his Lord. When he saw it move and slither as if it were a snake, he turned, fleeing in fear of it and did not return. His Lord then called him: “O Moses! Come forward and do not fear it, because you one of those who are safe from it and other things you may fear.”"
"Put your hand inside your shirt. It will come out white without a tarnish of blame; and do not be perturbed or afraid. These are two proofs from your Lord for the Pharaoh and his nobles. They are certainly a rebellious people.""",31,28,ٱسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوٓءٍ وَٱضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ ٱلرَّهْبِ فَذَٰنِكَ بُرْهَٰنَانِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦٓ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا فَٰسِقِينَ,"“Enter your right hand into your shirt collar, it will turn white upon you taking it out without any ailment.” So Moses placed it into his collar and removed it, with it having turned white like snow. “and draw your arm to your side” so Moses pressed it against his side and his fear subsided. So these two things that have been mentioned:  the staff and the hand, are two proofs sent from your Lord to Pharaoh and the leaders from his people. Indeed, they were a nation who left the obedience of Allah by disbelief and sin."
"He said: ""O Lord, I have killed a man of theirs, and fear they would kill me.",32,28,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى قَتَلْتُ مِنْهُمْ نَفْسًا فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ,"Moses said, pleading to his Lord, “Indeed, I have killed a man from amongst them: the Copt that a man from my tribe sought my help against, and so I fear that if I was to go to convey to them the message I have been sent with, they will kill me in return.”"
"So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar.""",33,28,وَأَخِى هَٰرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَانًا فَأَرْسِلْهُ مَعِىَ رِدْءًا يُصَدِّقُنِىٓ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ,"And my brother Aaron speaks with more clarity than I do, so send him with me as my aide. I fear Pharaoh and his people will reject me, just as it is common for nations passed to reject the Messengers that were sent to them."
"(And) God said: ""We shall strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you power with Our signs and give you authority, so that they will not be able to harm you. Both of you and your followers will be victorious.""",34,28,قَالَ سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَٰنًا فَلَا يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكُمَا ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ,"Allah said in response to Moses’s supplication, “O Moses! I shall strengthen you by sending your brother with you as a Messenger and aide to you, and give you the upper hand over your enemy. They shall not be able to harm you with anything you dislike. By our ayaat (signs), you and those believers who follow you, will be victorious over Pharoah and his people.”"
"But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said: ""This is nothing but magic he has contrived, for we have not heard of this from our fathers of old.""",35,28,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم مُّوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالُوا۟ مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَمَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَٰذَا فِىٓ ءَابَآئِنَا ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"When Moses (peace be upon him) brought My clear signs to them, they said, “This is nothing but a lie that Moses has fabricated; we have not heard anything like it from our forefathers. If it had been true, we would have heard something of the sort among the nations that have passed before us.”"
"But Moses said: ""My Lord knows well who has come with guidance from Him, and for whom is the guerdon of Paradise. But surely the wicked will not prosper.""",36,28,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن جَآءَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ مِنْ عِندِهِۦ وَمَن تَكُونُ لَهُۥ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلدَّارِ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"And Moses, addressing Pharaoh, said, “My Lord knows of the truthful one who has brought the guidance from Him, may He be glorified; He also knows who will face a praiseworthy outcome in the afterlife. The oppressors will never succeed in achieving their motives and acquiring safety from their fears.”"
"The Pharaoh said: ""O nobles, I am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself. So, O Haman, fire some clay (bricks) to build a tower for me that I may mount up (and see) the God of Moses; for I think he is a liar.""",37,28,وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلَأُ مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرِى فَأَوْقِدْ لِى يَٰهَٰمَٰنُ عَلَى ٱلطِّينِ فَٱجْعَل لِّى صَرْحًا لَّعَلِّىٓ أَطَّلِعُ إِلَىٰٓ إِلَٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّى لَأَظُنُّهُۥ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"Addressing the leaders from his people, Pharaoh said, “O Leaders! I do not know of any deity for you except myself, so O Haman, bake some bricks and build a tall structure for me so that I can look at the deity of Moses and acquaint myself with Him. We believe Moses to be lying in his claim to have been sent as a Messenger for Allah, to me and my people.”"
"He and his soldiers had become arrogant in the land for no reason, and did not think that they have to come back to Us in the end.",38,28,وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ هُوَ وَجُنُودُهُۥ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا يُرْجَعُونَ,Pharaoh and his armies became arrogant and sought to remain dominant in Egypt without any right. They denied the resurrection and thought they would not return to Me on the Day of Judgement for accountability and requital.
So We seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea. Behold then how was the end of the wicked!,39,28,فَأَخَذْنَٰهُ وَجُنُودَهُۥ فَنَبَذْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"So I seized him and his armies, and threw them into the sea, destroying them by drowning them all. O Messenger! Ponder over what the outcome and ending of the oppressors was: it was destruction."
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.,40,28,وَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لَا يُنصَرُونَ,"I made Pharoah and his people leaders/predecessors for the tyrants and misguided after them, by spreading to their disbelief and misguidance they are calling to the fire. And on the of judgement, they will not be helped by being saved from the punishment; rather, the punishment will be multiplied for them because of the evil example of calling towards deviation they set. The consequences of their evil deeds and those of whoever followed them, shall be decreed against them."
"A curse lies upon them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised.",41,28,وَأَتْبَعْنَٰهُمْ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ هُم مِّنَ ٱلْمَقْبُوحِينَ,"And I followed their punishment up with another, which was humiliation and exile in the worldly life. And then on the Day of Judgement they will be distanced from My mercy and detested by Me and My believing servants."
"After We had destroyed the earlier generations We gave Moses the Book as evidence for mankind, and a guidance and grace, so that they may remember.",42,28,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْقُرُونَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"Verily I gave Moses the Torah after I had sent My Messengers to the previous nations who were destroyed because they disbelieved. In this Torah were clear evidences and teachings showing people that which would benefit them and that which would lead to their harm. Therein was instruction towards goodness and mercy leading you to the good of both this world and the Hearafter. Perhaps then they would contemplate over the bounties of Allah upon them, showing gratitude and believing in Him."
"You were not there on the western side (of Mount Sinai) when We gave the commandments to Moses, nor were you witness (to the event).",43,28,وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ ٱلْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلْأَمْرَ وَمَا كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"O Messenger! You were not present on the western side of the mountain from Moses’s perspective, when I completed the matter of sending Moses as a Messenger to Pharaoh and his people. You were not present to know of that incident so you could relate it to people, so what you do relate to them is only due to Allah’s revelation to you."
"We raised (many more) generations and prolonged their lives. You did not live with the people of Midian, nor recited to them Our revelations; but We kept on sending messengers.",44,28,وَلَٰكِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَا قُرُونًا فَتَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْعُمُرُ وَمَا كُنتَ ثَاوِيًا فِىٓ أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا وَلَٰكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ,"However, I created nations and other creations after Moses and a long time passed due to which they forgot the covenants of Allah. You were not a resident of Madyan reciting My verses before them; but I sent you as a Messenger of My own accord and revealed the incident of Moses and his residing in Madyan to you, which you then related to the people."
"You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called. And all this (knowledge that you are given) is by the grace of your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no admonisher had come before you, that they may take heed;",45,28,وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ إِذْ نَادَيْنَا وَلَٰكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْمًا مَّآ أَتَىٰهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"Neither were you present at the side of mount Sinai when I called out to Moses and revealed whatever I revealed to him, so that you could relate that to the people either. Rather, I sent you as a mercy from your Lord to the people and revealed that incident to you, so that you could warn a nation to whom no Messenger had come prior to yourself, perhaps they would take heed and believe in whatever was brought to them from Allah, may He be glorified."
"And in case disaster comes upon them for what they have done themselves, they should say: ""O Lord, why did You not send an apostle to us that we should have followed Your commands, and been with those who are believers;""",46,28,وَلَوْلَآ أَن تُصِيبَهُم مُّصِيبَةٌۢ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُوا۟ رَبَّنَا لَوْلَآ أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولًا فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَٰتِكَ وَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"And if a divine punishment were to afflict them due to the sins and disbelief they were upon, they would have argued: “why did you not send a messenger to us, so we could have followed your ayaat and acted upon them, and have been from the true believers who follow your commandments. If it was not for that we would have hastened the punishment. However, we delayed it so that we may be excused by sending a messenger to them.”"
"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: ""Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?"" Did they not disbelieve before in what was given to Moses? They said: ""Both are imposters one like the other,"" and added: ""We do not believe in either.""",47,28,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُوتِىَ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَىٰٓ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفُرُوا۟ بِمَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ قَالُوا۟ سِحْرَانِ تَظَٰهَرَا وَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا بِكُلٍّ كَٰفِرُونَ,"So when Muhammad came to them as a Messenger, they said: “Why has Muhammad not been given miracles proving his messengership, similar to what Moses was given in the Hand, Staff and the Torah which was revealed at once?” O Messenger! Say to them, refuting them: “Did the Jews not reject what Moses was given previously, and they said regarding the Torah and the Qur’ān, “Both are sorcery, each supporting the other!” and they also said, “I reject both the Torah and the Qur’ān!”?"
"Say: ""Then bring a Book from God which gives better guidance than these so that I may follow it, if you speak the truth.""",48,28,قُلْ فَأْتُوا۟ بِكِتَٰبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to these people: “If indeed you are truthful in your claim that the Torah and Qur’ān are sorcery, bring a book revealed by Allah which is better in guidance than the two. If you bring forth one, I shall follow it.”"
"Then, if they cannot give you an answer, know that they are only following their lusts. And who can be farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from God? And certainly God does not guide an unjust people.",49,28,فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَكَ فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ بِغَيْرِ هُدًى مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"And if they do not take up your challenge to bring a book better guiding than the Torah and Qur’ān, know for certain that their rejection of the two is not based on any proof; it is only a result of following their own desires. There is no one more deviant than the one who follows his desires without guidance from Allah, may He be glorified. Allah does not grant a nation who wrongs itself through disbelief in Allah, opposing His Messengers and countering the truth that comes to them from Allah with falsehood, the ability to be guided."
We have been sending word to them that they may take a warning.,50,28,وَلَقَدْ وَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"I continuously conveyed to the idolaters and the Jews amongst the People of the Book the word regarding the stories of the previous nations and the punishment I sent down on them when they denied My Messengers, in the hope that they will be reminded by this and then believe, so that they are not afflicted by what afflicted them."
Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it;,51,28,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِهِۦ هُم بِهِۦ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Those who were firm in believing the Torah before the Qur’ān was revealed believe in the Qur’ān, due to them finding it being informed of and described in their books."
"And when it is read out to them, say: ""We believe in it. It's the truth from our Lord. We had committed ourselves before it came.""",52,28,وَإِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِۦ مُسْلِمِينَ,"When it is recited to them they say: “We believe it is the truth in which there is no doubt and which is revealed from our Lord. We were Muslims before this Qur’ān was revealed, due to our faith in what the Messengers before him brought”."
"These will be given their recompense twice, for they persevered and repelled evil with good, and spent of what We had given them.",53,28,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُؤْتَوْنَ أَجْرَهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ بِمَا صَبَرُوا۟ وَيَدْرَءُونَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"Those who have been described as mentioned will be given the reward of their actions by Allah twice, due to their persevering in faith in their own book and due to their faith in Muhammad (peace be upon him) when he was sent. They repel through the good of their righteous actions the sins they earned, and from what I have provided them they spend in the avenues of good."
"When they hear idle talk they turn aside and say: ""To us our actions, to you yours. Peace on you; we do not look for the ignorant.""",54,28,وَإِذَا سَمِعُوا۟ ٱللَّغْوَ أَعْرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَقَالُوا۟ لَنَآ أَعْمَٰلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَٰلُكُمْ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَا نَبْتَغِى ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,"When these believers hear any false speech from the People of the Book, they turn away from it without paying attention it, and they say addressing those who say such: “For us is the reward of our actions and for you is the reward of your actions. You are safe from us swearing and causing harm. I do not seek to accompany ignorant people, due to the damage and harm it contains for one’s religion and worldly life”."
You cannot guide any one you like: God guides whosoever He please. He knows best who will come to guidance.,55,28,إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"O Messenger, you do not guide whomever you love, such as Abu Talib and others, by enabling him to bring faith, but rather Allah alone is the one who enables whomever He wants to be guided. And He knows better regarding whom it has already passed in His knowledge that he will be amongst those guided to the straight path."
"They say: ""If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force."" Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us? But most of them do not understand.",56,28,وَقَالُوٓا۟ إِن نَّتَّبِعِ ٱلْهُدَىٰ مَعَكَ نُتَخَطَّفْ مِنْ أَرْضِنَآ أَوَلَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّهُمْ حَرَمًا ءَامِنًا يُجْبَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ ثَمَرَٰتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ رِّزْقًا مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"The idolaters amongst the people of Makkah said, excusing themselves from following Islam and bringing faith in it: “If we follow this Islam which you brought, our enemies will quickly snatch us from our land”. Did I not establish these idolaters in a safe sanctuary in which bloodshed and oppression are unlawful, and in which they are safe from others attacking them, with fruits of everything being brought to them as sustenance from Me which I draw towards them?” However, most of them do not know what Allah has blessed them with that they should be grateful to Him."
How many habitations that had come to boast of their resources have We destroyed? These their dwellings were never inhabited except rarely after them; and they came back to Us.,57,28,وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍۭ بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا فَتِلْكَ مَسَٰكِنُهُمْ لَمْ تُسْكَن مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْوَٰرِثِينَ,"And how many a city were there which were ungrateful for Allah’s blessings on them, then they exceeded the bounds in sins and disobedience, so I sent a punishment to them and destroyed them through it. So these are their dwellings in ruins, with people passing by them. They were not inhabited after those who lived in them, except for a few travellers. And it is I who will inherit the heavens, the earth and everyone in them."
But your Lord does not destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out Our commandments to them. We would never have destroyed cities if their inhabitants were not given to wickedness.,58,28,وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِىٓ أُمِّهَا رَسُولًا يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا وَمَا كُنَّا مُهْلِكِى ٱلْقُرَىٰٓ إِلَّا وَأَهْلُهَا ظَٰلِمُونَ,"O Messenger, your Lord did not destroy the cities until he had given opportunity to their inhabitants by sending Messengers to their main cities, just as He sent you to the Mother of Cities. And I was not one to destroy the people of the cities when they were firm on the truth. I only destroy them when they are unjust through disbelief and committing sins."
"Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding. Will you not understand?",59,28,وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَمَتَٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتُهَا وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰٓ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"Whatever your Lord has given you, it is of what you enjoy and adorn yourselves with in this worldly life, then it will finish. And the great reward which is with Allah in the afterlife is better and more lasting than the enjoyment and adornment in this world. Do you not understand that so that you prefer what is everlasting over what is going to finish?"
"Can one who was given a better promise, which he will find come true, be like him who was given a little enjoyment of this life, but who will afterwards be brought (to judgement) on the Day of Resurrection?",60,28,أَفَمَن وَعَدْنَٰهُ وَعْدًا حَسَنًا فَهُوَ لَٰقِيهِ كَمَن مَّتَّعْنَٰهُ مَتَٰعَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ هُوَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْضَرِينَ,"Is the one I have promised paradise in the afterlife and the everlasting pleasure it contains like the one I have given wealth and adornment to enjoy in the worldly life, then he will be on the day of judgment amongst those who will be presented to the fire of hell?"
"That day God will call them and ask: ""Where are they you imagined were My compeers?""",61,28,وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآءِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,On the day their Lord will call them saying: “Where are My partners you used to worship besides Me and claim they are My partners?”
"Those against whom the sentence is justified will say: ""O Lord, these are those we had led astray as we had ourselves gone astray. We clear ourselves before You: They never worshipped us.""",62,28,قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ رَبَّنَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَغْوَيْنَآ أَغْوَيْنَٰهُمْ كَمَا غَوَيْنَا تَبَرَّأْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كَانُوٓا۟ إِيَّانَا يَعْبُدُونَ,"The callers towards disbelief for whom the punishment will become binding will say: “Our Lord, these are the ones I misguided just as I became misguided. I disassociate ourselves from them to You. They never used to worship us, but they only used to worship the satans”."
"(The sinners) will be told: ""Invoke your partners."" They will call on them, but they will not answer; and they will see the torment (and wish) if only they had come to guidance.",63,28,وَقِيلَ ٱدْعُوا۟ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لَهُمْ وَرَأَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ يَهْتَدُونَ,"It will be said to them: “Call upon your partners so they can save you from the disgrace you are in”. They will then call their partners, but they will not respond to their call, and they will see the punishment prepared for them. If they had been amongst those guided to the truth, they would not have fallen into the punishment."
"(God) will ask them on that day: ""What answer did you give the apostles?""",64,28,وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أَجَبْتُمُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,On the day their Lord will call them saying: “What answer did you give My Messengers I sent to you?”
"Then all news will be blacked out for them, and they will not even ask one another.",65,28,فَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْأَنۢبَآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لَا يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"So that which they can argue with will become hidden to them and they will not mention anything. They will not ask one another, due to the frightening shock they will be in, because they will know for sure they are heading towards the punishment."
But he who repents and believes and does good things may well be among the successful.,66,28,فَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَعَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْلِحِينَ,"As for one amongst these idolaters who repents from his disbelief, brings faith in Allah and His Messengers, and does good actions, perhaps he will be amongst those who are successful in attaining what they seek and who are saved from what they fear."
Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. The good is not for them to choose. Too holy and high is God for what they associate with Him.,67,28,وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيَخْتَارُ مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخِيَرَةُ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"O Messenger, your Lord creates what He wishes to create, and He chooses whoever he wants for His obedience and prophethood. The idolaters have no choice that they should object to Allah. Pure and holy is Allah from the partners they worship with Him."
Your Lord well knows what they hide in their breasts and what they disclose.,68,28,وَرَبُّكَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,And your Lord knows what their chests hide and make apparent. Nothing of this is hidden from Him and He shall reward them for it.
"He is God. There is no god but He. His alone is praise first and last, and His the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end.",69,28,وَهُوَ ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ لَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِى ٱلْأُولَىٰ وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And He is Allah besides whom there is no true deity. For Him alone is praise in this world and for Him is praise in the afterlife. For Him is the decree which is implemented and which nothing can repel. And to Him alone you will be returned on the day of judgment for reckoning and recompense.
"Say: ""Just think, if God were to cover you up with night for ever until the Day of Doom, what other god apart from God will give you light? Why do you not pay heed?""",70,28,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِضِيَآءٍ أَفَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: Tell me if Allah were to make the light last continuously for you, without any break until the Day of Judgment, which god besides Allah can bring you light like that of day? Do you not hear these proofs and know that there is no god besides Allah who can bring that to you?"
"Say: ""Just think. If God were to make the day perpetual till the Day of Resurrection, what other god but God would bring you night for rest? Why do you not reflect?",71,28,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلنَّهَارَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to them: Tell me if Allah were to make the day last continuously for you until the Day of Judgment, which god besides Allah can bring you night in which you can rest to be relieved of the tiredness of working in the day? Do you not see these signs and know that there is no god besides Allah who can bring any of that to you?"
"Yet in His benevolence He made you night and day that you may rest and seek His bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful.""",72,28,وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِۦ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُوا۟ فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"And it is from His mercy, O people, that He has made the night dark for you, so you can rest in it after you have become tired through working in the day, and He has made the day bright for you, so you can strive to earn sustenance in it, and so that you can be grateful for Allah’s blessings on you and not be ungrateful for them."
"Upon a day He will call them and ask: ""Where are they you imagined were My compeers?""",73,28,وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآءِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,On the day their Lord will call them saying: “Where are My partners you used to worship besides Me and claim they are My partners?”
"And We shall single out one witness from each community and say: ""Bring your proof."" Then will they know that God's is the judgement, and what they contrived will avail them not in the least.",74,28,وَنَزَعْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا فَقُلْنَا هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ فَعَلِمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱلْحَقَّ لِلَّهِ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"I shall bring from every nation its prophet to testify against them their disbelief and denial, then I will say to these nations: “Bring your proofs and evidences for the disbelief and denial you were in”. So their pretexts will run out and they will be convinced that the truth in which there is no doubt is for Allah, and the partners they used to invent for Him will disappear from him."
"Verily Qarun was of Moses' people, but he began to oppress them. We had given him treasures, so many that a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys. His people said to him: ""Do not be exultant. God does not like those who exult.",75,28,إِنَّ قَٰرُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ فَبَغَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلْكُنُوزِ مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُۥ لَتَنُوٓأُ بِٱلْعُصْبَةِ أُو۟لِى ٱلْقُوَّةِ إِذْ قَالَ لَهُۥ قَوْمُهُۥ لَا تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْفَرِحِينَ,"Qarun was from the people of Moses (peace be upon him), but he was arrogant over them. And I granted him such treasures of wealth, that the keys to his treasuries would be heavy to carry for even a strong group. When his people said to him: “Do not rejoice arrogantly, for Allah does not love those who rejoice arrogantly, but rather he despises them and will punish them for that."
"So seek the abode of the Hereafter through what God has given you, and do not forget your part in this world. Do good to others as God has done good to you, and do not try to spread corruption in the land. Surely God does not like corrupters.""",76,28,وَٱبْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَىٰكَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلدَّارَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ وَلَا تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ وَلَا تَبْغِ ٱلْفَسَادَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"And seek by the wealth Allah has given you the reward of the abode of the afterlife, by spending it in avenues of good. Do not forget your share of food, drink, clothes, and so forth amongst the blessings, without excessiveness or pride. And deal well with your Lord and with His servants, just as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek corruption on earth by committing sins and leaving obedience. Allah does not love those who cause corruption on earth through that. In fact, he despises them”."
"He said: ""This has come to me through my own acumen."" Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations before him who possessed far more acumen than he, and more wealth? The sinners will not be asked about their sins.",77,28,قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُۥ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عِندِىٓ أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعًا وَلَا يُسْـَٔلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"Qarun said: “I have only been given this wealth because of the knowledge and power I have, so I am deserving of that”. Did Qarun not know that Allah had destroyed nations before him who were stronger and who had gathered more wealth? But there power or wealth did not benefit them. On the Day of Judgment, the wrongdoers will not be interrogated about their sins due to Allah's complete knowledge of them and any questioning they will face is for reprimand and censure."
"Then he came before his people in all pomp; and those enamoured of this world, said: ""Ah would that we had what Qarun has been given! He indeed possesses great good fortune.""",78,28,فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ فِى زِينَتِهِۦ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا يَٰلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَٰرُونُ إِنَّهُۥ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ,"Qarun came out in his adornment, showing off his wealth and status. Those amongst Qarun’s companions who were desirous of the adornment of the worldly life said: “If only we were given worldly adornment like Qarun has been given. Indeed he has been given a great share of everything!”."
"But those who knew better, said: ""Alack-a-day! God's guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right. Only those who persevere will receive it.""",79,28,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا وَلَا يُلَقَّىٰهَآ إِلَّا ٱلصَّٰبِرُونَ,Those given knowledge said when they saw Qarun in his adornment and when they heard what his companions wished for: “Woe unto you! The reward of Allah in the afterlife and the pleasure He has prepared for those who bring faith and do good deeds is better than the worldly splendour given to Qarun”. And none are granted the ability to say this statement and act accordingly except the patient who persevere in preferring the reward with Allah over the temporary enjoyment of this world.
"So We opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion. There was not a body that could help him against (the will) of God, nor was he able to save himself.",80,28,فَخَسَفْنَا بِهِۦ وَبِدَارِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ فَمَا كَانَ لَهُۥ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُۥ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنتَصِرِينَ,"Then I made the earth swallow him and his house, along with all in it, in retribution for his transgression. He had no group to help him against Allah nor was he amongst those who can help themselves."
"Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: ""Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed.""",81,28,وَأَصْبَحَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْا۟ مَكَانَهُۥ بِٱلْأَمْسِ يَقُولُونَ وَيْكَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَقْدِرُ لَوْلَآ أَن مَّنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا وَيْكَأَنَّهُۥ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"Those who wished for the wealth and adornment he had before being swallowed up began saying heedfully: “Did we not know that Allah extends sustenance for whom He wishes amongst His servants and restricts it for whomever He wishes amongst them? Had Allah not favoured us by not punishing us for what we said, He would have made the earth swallow us as He did with Qarun. The disbelievers are not successful, neither in this life or the afterlife, but rather their return and outcome is loss in both”."
We shall give the mansion of the Hereafter to those who do not want to be haughty in the land and spread corruption. The future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path.,82,28,تِلْكَ ٱلدَّارُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوًّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا فَسَادًا وَٱلْعَٰقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"That is the abode of the afterlife which I shall make an abode of pleasure and honour for those who do not seek to be arrogant on earth by turning away from faith in the truth and its followers, nor do they want corruption in it. And the praiseworthy outcome, in the form of the enjoyment of paradise and the pleasure of Allah therein, is for those who are mindful of their Lord by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions."
Whoever does good will receive better than what he has done; and whoever does ill shall be requited but to the extent of what he does.,83,28,مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُۥ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَى ٱلَّذِينَ عَمِلُوا۟ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ إِلَّا مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Whoever brings a good deed on the Day of Judgment, such as prayer, Zakat, fasting and so forth, for him is a good reward for that good deed, where the good deed will be multiplied to ten the like thereof. And whoever brings a bad deed on the Day of Judgment, such as disbelief, consuming interest, adultery and so forth, then those who did bad deeds will not be rewarded except as much as they did, without any increase."
"He who has assigned (the propagation) of the Qur'an to you will bring you back to the destination. Say: ""My Lord knows who has come to guidance, and who is clearly in error.""",84,28,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَىٰ مَعَادٍ قُل رَّبِّىٓ أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"The One who revealed the Qur’ān to you and made it compulsory upon you to convey it and act upon it is going to return you to Makkah victoriously. O Messenger, say to the idolaters: “My Lord knows best who has brought guidance and who is clearly astray from guidance and truth”."
"You did not expect that the Book would be given to you except by the favour of your Lord. So do not be the helper of unbelievers,",85,28,وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُوٓا۟ أَن يُلْقَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ ظَهِيرًا لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"O Messenger, you did not expect, before prophethood, that the Qur’ān would be revealed to you, as revelation from Allah. However, His mercy required it to be revealed to you, so do not be a helper to the disbelievers in the misguidance they are upon."
"Nor should you let them turn you away from the commandments of God once they have been delivered to you; and call them to your Lord, and do not be an idolater,",86,28,وَلَا يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ وَٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"These idolaters should not turn you away from the verses of Allah after they have been revealed to you, making you leave reciting and conveying them. And call people towards faith in Allah, declaring His Oneness, and acting on His sacred law. And do not become from the idolaters who worship others besides Allah, but rather be from those who declare Allah’s Oneness and only worship Allah alone."
"And do not call on any other god apart from God. There is no god but He. All things will perish save His magnificence. His is the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end.",87,28,وَلَا تَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُۥ لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And do not worship alongside Allah any god besides Him. There is no true god besides Him. Everything will perish besides His Face. For Him alone is the judgment; He judges as He wishes. And to Him alone you will be returned on the day of judgment to be reckoned and rewarded.
ALIF LAM MIM.,0,29,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓ,Alif Lam Meem. The discussion on similar letters has already passed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"Do men think they will get away by saying: ""We believe,"" and will not be tried?",1,29,أَحَسِبَ ٱلنَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوٓا۟ أَن يَقُولُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ,"Did the people think that by saying: “I brought faith in Allah”, they will be left without any test to clarify the reality of what they said: are they true believers? The matter is not as they thought."
"We had tried those who were before them so that God knew who spoke the truth, and who were liars.",2,29,وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا۟ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱلْكَٰذِبِينَ,"I tested those before them, so Allah will make clear and disclose to you the truth of those who were true in their faith and the lie of those who were dishonest therein."
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make!,3,29,أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ أَن يَسْبِقُونَا سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,"Or did those who commit sins such as idolatry and so forth think they will escape us and be saved from My punishment? Bad is the judgment they make, for they will not be able to make Allah powerless nor will they be saved from His punishment if they die on their disbelief."
He who hopes to meet God (should know) that God's appointed time will surely come. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.,4,29,مَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ لِقَآءَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ أَجَلَ ٱللَّهِ لَءَاتٍ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Whoever is hopeful of meeting Allah on the day of judgment so He can reward him should know that the time Allah has appointed for that is coming soon. And He is Hearing of the statements of His servants, Knowing of their actions. Nothing of their actions are hidden from Him and He shall reward them accordingly."
He who strives does so for himself. Verily God is independent of the creatures of the world.,5,29,وَمَن جَٰهَدَ فَإِنَّمَا يُجَٰهِدُ لِنَفْسِهِۦٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"And whoever exerts himself by motivating it to guidance and staying far from disobedience, and whoever strives in the way of Allah, he is only doing so for his own benefit. Allah is Self-Sufficient and in no need of all the creation. Their obedience does not increase Him nor does their disobedience decrease Him."
"We shall pardon the sinful deeds of those who believe and do the right, and give them a reward better than their deeds.",6,29,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَنُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَحْسَنَ ٱلَّذِى كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Those who brought faith and were patient on our testing them, and who did good actions, I shall wipe out their sins due to the good actions they did, and I shall reward them in the afterlife with the best of what they used to do in this world."
"We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents; but if they try to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. You have to come back to Us, when I will tell you what you used to do.",7,29,وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ بِوَٰلِدَيْهِ حُسْنًا وَإِن جَٰهَدَاكَ لِتُشْرِكَ بِى مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَآ إِلَىَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And I enjoined upon humankind that they be righteous and good with their parents. O man, if your parents force you to associate with Me that whose association you have no knowledge of - as occurred with Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas from his mother - do not obey them in that, because there is no obedience to the creation in disobedience to the Creator. To Me alone is your return on the Day of Judgment, then I shall inform you of what you used to do in the world and I shall reward you for it."
We shall admit those who believe and do the right among the righteous.,8,29,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَنُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"And those who brought faith and did good actions, I shall enter them on the day of judgment amongst the righteous, thus I will raise them with them and grant them their reward."
"There are among men those who say: ""We believe in God;"" yet if they happen to suffer in the cause of God they take oppression by men as punishment from God. And if help comes to them from your Lord, they say: ""We were with you."" Does not God know what is hidden in the hearts of men?",9,29,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ فَإِذَآ أُوذِىَ فِى ٱللَّهِ جَعَلَ فِتْنَةَ ٱلنَّاسِ كَعَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَئِن جَآءَ نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ أَوَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِمَا فِى صُدُورِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Amongst people is he who says: “I brought faith in Allah”. But when the disbelievers afflict him with harm due to his faith, he considers their torture the punishment of Allah, hence he renounces faith to conform with the disbelievers. And if you achieve help from your Lord, O Messenger, they will say: “We are with you in faith, O believers”. Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of people, nothing of disbelief and faith they contain being hidden from Him? So how do you inform Allah of what is in their hearts when He knows better than them what they contain?"
God will surely know the believers and know the hypocrites.,10,29,وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ,And surely Allah will make clear to His servants those who truly brought faith and He will make clear those who display faith but hide disbelief.
"Those who deny say to those who affirm: ""Follow our way; we shall carry the burden of your sins."" But they cannot carry the burden of their sins in the least. They are liars indeed.",11,29,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ سَبِيلَنَا وَلْنَحْمِلْ خَطَٰيَٰكُمْ وَمَا هُم بِحَٰمِلِينَ مِنْ خَطَٰيَٰهُم مِّن شَىْءٍ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"And the disbelievers said to those who brought faith in Allah alone: “Follow our religion and what we are on, and we will carry your sins for you and we take responsibility for them”. They will not carry any of their sins, and they are lying in this statement of theirs."
They will carry their own loads and other loads besides their own; and will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they contrived.,12,29,وَلَيَحْمِلُنَّ أَثْقَالَهُمْ وَأَثْقَالًا مَّعَ أَثْقَالِهِمْ وَلَيُسْـَٔلُنَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ عَمَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"And I shall burden these idolaters who call towards their falsehood with the sins they committed and I shall burden them with the sins of those who followed their call, without any of the sins of their followers being decreased. And they will be questioned on the day of judgment regarding the falsehood they used to invent in this world."
"We sent Noah to his people, and he lived with them a thousand years minus fifty. Then they were caught by the deluge for they were evil.",13,29,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ فَلَبِثَ فِيهِمْ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلَّا خَمْسِينَ عَامًا فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱلطُّوفَانُ وَهُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"And I sent Noah as a Messenger to his people, then he stayed amongst them for a period of nine hundred and fifty years, calling them to the Oneness of Allah. But they denied him and remained on their disbelief, so the flood seized them whilst they were wrongdoers due to their disbelief in Allah and their denial of the Messengers, thus they were destroyed through drowning."
"But We saved him and those with him in the ark, and made it a sign for the creatures of the world.",14,29,فَأَنجَيْنَٰهُ وَأَصْحَٰبَ ٱلسَّفِينَةِ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَآ ءَايَةً لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"So I saved Noah and the believers with him in the ark from being destroyed through drowning, and I made the ark a sign for people to take heed from."
"And (remember) Abraham who said to his people: ""Worship God and be obedient to Him. This is better for you if you understand.",15,29,وَإِبْرَٰهِيمَ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, remember the story of Abraham when he said to his people: “Worship Allah alone, and fear His punishment by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions. That which is being ordered that is better for you if you really want to know what is better for you."
"You worship idols in place of God and invent lies. Surely those you worship other than God have no power over your means of livelihood. So seek your sustenance from God, and worship Him and give Him thanks. To Him will you be brought back in the end.",16,29,إِنَّمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْثَٰنًا وَتَخْلُقُونَ إِفْكًا إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ لَكُمْ رِزْقًا فَٱبْتَغُوا۟ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرِّزْقَ وَٱعْبُدُوهُ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لَهُۥٓ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"O idolaters, you are only worshipping idols which do not benefit or harm, and you are inventing a lie when you claim they are worthy of worship. Those whom you worship besides Allah do not have the ability to provide for you that they should provide you. Seek provision from Allah alone, as He is the Provider, worship Him alone, and thank Him for the provision He has blessed you with. To Him alone you will be returned on the day of judgment to be reckoned and rewarded, not to Your idols”."
"But if you deny, then many a people have denied before you. The duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly.""",17,29,وَإِن تُكَذِّبُوا۟ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أُمَمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمَا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"O idolaters, if you deny what Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought, then nations before you also denied, such as the nation of Noah, and Aad and Thamud. It is only upon the Messenger to clearly convey, and he has conveyed what his Lord ordered him to convey to you."
"Do they not see how God originates creation, then reverts it back? This is indeed how inevitably the law of God works;",18,29,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ كَيْفَ يُبْدِئُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥٓ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"Do these deniers not see how Allah created the creation initially, then He shall restore it after it has finished? This is easy for Allah, as He is Powerful with nothing is beyond His ability."
"Say: ""Travel on the earth and see how He originated creation. Then (you will know) how God will raise the last raising (of the dead). Surely God has power over everything,",19,29,قُلْ سِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ بَدَأَ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ ٱللَّهُ يُنشِئُ ٱلنَّشْأَةَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O Messenger, say to these deniers of the resurrection: “Travel through the land and think how Allah began the creation. Then Allah will restore people after their death to the second life for the resurrection and reckoning. Allah is Powerful over everything; nothing is outside His ability, so He is able to resurrect people just as He created them in the first place”."
"Punish whom He will, and have mercy on whom He please. And to Him will you be brought back in the end.",20,29,يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُقْلَبُونَ,"He punishes whom He wishes from His creation through His justice, and He has mercy on whom He wishes amongst His creation through His grace."
Escape Him you cannot either in the earth or in the sky; and you have no friend or helper apart from God.,21,29,وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"You are not going to escape your Lord, nor can you flee from His punishment on earth or in the heavens. You do not have besides Allah any helper to take care of your affairs nor do you have any assistant to lift His punishment from you."
"Those who deny the signs of God and the meeting with Him, cannot have hope of My mercy. There is a painful punishment for them.",22,29,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِقَآئِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَئِسُوا۟ مِن رَّحْمَتِى وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Those who disbelieved in the verses of Allah and meeting Him on the Day of Judgment, those have lost hope in My mercy, so they will never enter paradise due to their disbelief, and those will have a painful punishment that will await them in the afterlife."
"The people (of Abraham) had no answer except: ""Kill him or burn him;"" but God saved him from the fire. There are lessons in this for those who believe.",23,29,فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوا۟ ٱقْتُلُوهُ أَوْ حَرِّقُوهُ فَأَنجَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The only answer Abraham’s people gave to him - after he had instructed them to worship Allah alone and to give up the worship of idols - was that they said: Kill him or throw him into the fire in defence of your gods. But Allah saved him from the Fire. In his being saved from the fire after having been thrown into it there truly are lessons for people who have faith, because they are the one who benefit from such lessons."
"He said: ""You have taken to idols through mutual affection in this life, in place of God, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse each other, and your abode will be Hell, and you will have none to help you.""",24,29,وَقَالَ إِنَّمَا ٱتَّخَذْتُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْثَٰنًا مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُم بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا وَمَأْوَىٰكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"Abraham (peace be upon him) said to his people: You have only taken idols as gods whom you worship for your mutual recognition and affection for their worship in the present life. Then, on the Day of Judgement, this mutual affection between you will end and you will disown and curse one another when you see the punishment. The fire will be the place you resort to and no one will help and protect you against Allah’s punishment, not the idols that you used to worship besides Allah and nor anyone else."
"Then Lot believed in him; and (Abraham) said: ""I will separate myself and take refuge in my Lord. Surely He is all-mighty and all-wise.""",25,29,فَـَٔامَنَ لَهُۥ لُوطٌ وَقَالَ إِنِّى مُهَاجِرٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Lot (peace be upon him) believed in him and Abraham said: I will emigrate to my Lord, to the blessed land of Levant. He is the Mighty that cannot be challenged and the one who migrates to Him will never be humiliated. He is the Wise in His planning and estimation."
"So We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob and gave his progeny prophethood and scripture, and rewarded him in this world, and in the next he will be among the upright.",26,29,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥٓ إِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ ٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ أَجْرَهُۥ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"I gave Abraham Isaac and his son, Jacob. I placed prophethood and revealed scriptures from Allah among his offspring. I gave him the rewards of his steadfastness on the truth in this world, and in the life to come he will be given the reward of the righteous. What he was given in the world will not reduce the noble reward that has been prepared for him in the afterlife."
"And (remember) Lot when he said to his people: ""You indulge in lecherous acts which none of the creatures had done before you.",27,29,وَلُوطًا إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُم بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Messenger, remember the story of Lot when he said to his people: You are committing a terrible sin that was not perpetrated before you by anyone in the whole world. You are the first to innovate this sin that goes against the sound nature of man."
"You commit unnatural acts with men and cut off the way (of procreation), and commit obscenities in your gatherings."" The only answer his people made was: ""Bring the punishment of God, if you are truthful.""",28,29,أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ وَتَقْطَعُونَ ٱلسَّبِيلَ وَتَأْتُونَ فِى نَادِيكُمُ ٱلْمُنكَرَ فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوا۟ ٱئْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Do you approach men from their backsides to satisfy your lust, cut off the way for travellers who cannot pass by you for fear of the obscene sin that you perpetrate, commit evil acts in your gatherings such as nudity and harm those who pass by with words and actions? But the only response from his people after he prohibited them from doing evil acts was that they said to him: Bring upon us Allah's punishment that you threaten us with, if you are truthful in your claim."
"""O Lord, help me against the wicked people,""(Lot) prayed.",29,29,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنصُرْنِى عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,Lot (peace be upon him) prayed to His Lord after his people were obstinate and had disparagingly demanded that the punishment be sent down on them: O my Lord! Help me against these people who spread corruption on earth by the disbelief and shameful sins that they promulgate.
"When Our messengers came to Abraham with good news, they said: ""We have to destroy this city as its inhabitants have become sinful.""",30,29,وَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ بِٱلْبُشْرَىٰ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مُهْلِكُوٓا۟ أَهْلِ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ إِنَّ أَهْلَهَا كَانُوا۟ ظَٰلِمِينَ,"When the angels whom I had sent came to give good news to Abraham of Isaac and after him his son, Jacob, they said to him: We are going to destroy the people of the town of Sodom, the town of the people of Lot. Its people were wrongdoers because of the obscene act that they were doing."
"He said: ""Surely Lot is there."" They answered: ""We know who is there. We are to save him and his family except his wife, for she is one of those who will stay behind.""",31,29,قَالَ إِنَّ فِيهَا لُوطًا قَالُوا۟ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِيهَا لَنُنَجِّيَنَّهُۥ وَأَهْلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱمْرَأَتَهُۥ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"Abraham (peace be upon him) said to the angels: But Lot is in that town whose people you wish to destroy and he is not one of the wrongdoers. The angels said: I know very well who is there. I will save him and his household from the destruction that will be sent down on the people of the town, except for his wife. She will be one of those who will be left behind, and we will destroy her with the rest of them."
"So, when Our messengers came to Lot, he was worried on their account as he was unable to protect them. They said: ""Have no fear or regret. We will certainly save you and your family except your wife, for she is one of those who will stay behind.",32,29,وَلَمَّآ أَن جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا سِىٓءَ بِهِمْ وَضَاقَ بِهِمْ ذَرْعًا وَقَالُوا۟ لَا تَخَفْ وَلَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّا مُنَجُّوكَ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلَّا ٱمْرَأَتَكَ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"When the angels whom I sent to destroy the people of Lot came to Lot, he was troubled and distressed by their coming, fearing for them the evil of his people, as the Messengers had come to him in the form of men and his people lusted after men instead of women. The angels said to him: Do not fear, for your people will not be able to harm you and do not grieve over the news of their destruction that I give you. I will certainly save you and your household from destruction, except for your wife. She will be one of those who will be left behind, and we will destroy her with the rest of them."
"We have to bring a scourge from the heavens on the people of this city as they are depraved.""",33,29,إِنَّا مُنزِلُونَ عَلَىٰٓ أَهْلِ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ رِجْزًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْسُقُونَ,"I will send a punishment from the sky down on the people of this town that used to do obscene acts, which is stones of baked clay, as a punishment for their leaving out following Allah by the perpetration of that evil and immoral act, which was satisfaction of lust with men instead of women."
Verily We have left a clear sign of this for people of sense to see.,34,29,وَلَقَد تَّرَكْنَا مِنْهَآ ءَايَةًۢ بَيِّنَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"I left some of this town that I destroyed as a clear sign for those who use their intellect for sound reasoning, because they are the ones who take a lesson from the signs."
"To Midian We sent their brother Shu'aib. He said: ""O people, worship God and be ready for the Day of Resurrection. Do no evil, and create no mischief in the land.""",35,29,وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا فَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱرْجُوا۟ ٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلْءَاخِرَ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"I sent to the people of Madyan their brother in lineage, Shu‘ayb (peace be upon him). He said: My people, worship Allah alone, and have hope by your worshipping Him for reward on the Last Day. Do not spread corruption on earth by committing and spreading sins."
"But they denied him and were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning.",36,29,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ فِى دَارِهِمْ جَٰثِمِينَ,"His people rejected him and so the earthquake struck them. When morning came, they were laying dead in their homes, and they were motionless."
"And (remember) 'Ad and Thamud. It will be clear to you from their habitations (how they were destroyed), for Satan had made their deeds look attractive to them, and turned them away from the path; and yet they were a people of acumen.",37,29,وَعَادًا وَثَمُودَا۟ وَقَد تَّبَيَّنَ لَكُم مِّن مَّسَٰكِنِهِمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَكَانُوا۟ مُسْتَبْصِرِينَ,"I also destroyed the tribe of 'Ad, the people of Hud, and the Thamud, the people of Salih. Signs of their destruction are clear to you - O people of Makkah - by what is left of their dwelling by Hijr (towards the Levant) and Shihr (near Hadramut). Their empty dwellings are evidence of that. Satan made their deeds of disbelief and other sins seem good to them and diverted them from the right path. They were capable of seeing truth from deviation and guidance from misguidance as their Messengers had taught them, but they chose to follow their desires instead of following guidance."
"(Remember) Qarun, Pharaoh and Haman to whom Moses came with clear signs; but they were haughty (and oppressed) the land. Yet they could not run away from Us;",38,29,وَقَٰرُونَ وَفِرْعَوْنَ وَهَٰمَٰنَ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مُّوسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ سَٰبِقِينَ,"I destroyed Qarun when he oppressed the people of Moses, by sinking him together with his property into the ground. I destroyed Pharaoh and his minister, Haman, by drowning them in the sea. Moses had brought them clear miracles indicating his truthfulness, but they behaved arrogantly in the land of Egypt and were too proud to have faith in him. They could not be saved from My punishment by escaping from Me."
"And We seized all of them for their crimes. Against some We sent a violent wind hurling stones, and some We seized with a mighty blast, and some We submerged under the earth, and some We drowned. It was not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves.",39,29,فَكُلًّا أَخَذْنَا بِذَنۢبِهِۦ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِ حَاصِبًا وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَخَذَتْهُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ خَسَفْنَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَغْرَقْنَا وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,So I seized each one of those mentioned above with My destructive punishment. Amongst them were the people of Lot on whom I sent down stones of baked clay. Amongst them were the people of Salih and the people of Shuaib who were overcome by a sudden blast. Amongst them was Qarun whom I sunk into the earth together with his property. Amongst them were the people of Noah and Pharaoh and Haman whom I destroyed by drowning. It was not Allah who wronged them by destroying them for no sin; but they wronged themselves by committing sin and thus were deserving of the punishment.
"The semblance of those who take protectors besides God is that of the spider. She arranges a house for herself, but the flimsiest of houses is the spider's. If only they had sense!",40,29,مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ كَمَثَلِ ٱلْعَنكَبُوتِ ٱتَّخَذَتْ بَيْتًا وَإِنَّ أَوْهَنَ ٱلْبُيُوتِ لَبَيْتُ ٱلْعَنكَبُوتِ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"The example of the idolaters who took idols whom they worshipped other than Allah in the hope that they will benefit them or intercede for them is like that of a spider that builds a house to protect it from heat and cold and from an assault against it. The frailest of all houses is the spider’s as it does not ward off any cold nor prevent any heat. Similarly, their idols will not benefit nor harm nor intercede. If the idolaters knew that, they would not have taken idols that they worship besides Allah."
"Verily God knows what they invoke in His place, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.",41,29,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مِن شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Allah, may He be glorified, knows what they worship besides Him. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. He is the Mighty Who cannot be challenged and the Wise in His creation, estimation and planning."
"These are precepts of wisdom We offer to men, but only those who are rational understand.",42,29,وَتِلْكَ ٱلْأَمْثَٰلُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلَّا ٱلْعَٰلِمُونَ,"These examples that I draw for people, to awaken them and make them see the truth and guide them to it, can only be grasped in the desired manner by those who have knowledge of Allah’s law and rule."
God has created the heavens and the earth with reason. Surely in this is a sign for those who believe.,43,29,خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, created the heavens and He created the earth with truth. He did not create them with falsehood and He did not create them in vain. In that creation there is clear indication of Allah’s Power for those who have faith, because they are the ones who will use Allah’s creation as evidence for the Creator, may He be glorified. The disbelievers however pass by the signs in the horizons and the signs within themselves without their attention being drawn to the greatness and power of the Creator, may He be glorified."
"Recite what has been revealed to you of this Book, and be constant in devotion. Surely prayer keeps you away from the obscene and detestable, but the remembrance of God is greater far; and God knows what you do.",44,29,ٱتْلُ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنكَرِ وَلَذِكْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَصْنَعُونَ,"Read - O Messenger - to people what Allah has revealed to you of the Qur’ān and do the prayer in the most perfect manner. Prayer that is discharged perfectly restrains the doer from falling into sins and wrong, because it creates a light in the heart that prevents the perpetration of sins and guides the person to doing righteous deeds. The remembrance of Allah is greater than and superior to every thing. Allah knows everything you are doing. None of your actions are hidden from him and He will recompense you for them. If they are good the recompense will be good and if they are evil the recompense will be evil."
"Do not argue with the people of the Book unless in a fair way, apart from those who act wrongly, and say to them: ""We believe what has been sent down to us, and we believe what has been sent down to you. Our God and your God is one, and to Him we submit.""",45,29,وَلَا تُجَٰدِلُوٓا۟ أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ وَقُولُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُنَا وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ وَٰحِدٌ وَنَحْنُ لَهُۥ مُسْلِمُونَ,"O believers! Do not discuss and debate with the Jews and Christians to whom the divine books were revealed, except in the best of manners and most exemplary of ways: inviting them by exhortation and establishing clear proofs. As for those of them who oppress by showing stubbornness and arrogance, fight them until they submit, or pay the Jizyah with their own hands while subdued. And say to the Jews and the Christians: “I have believed in whatever Allah has revealed to us in the Qur’ān, and in the Torah and Gospel that was revealed to you. Our Lord is one and so is yours, He has no partner in His lordship, worship or perfection, and we submit and humble ourselves to Him alone.”"
That is how We have revealed this Book to you and those to whom We have sent down the Book will believe in it. Only those who are infidels will deny it.,46,29,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ فَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَمِنْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَّا ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"And just as I revealed the Books upon those before you, I revealed the Qur’ān upon you. Some of those who read the Torah, such as Abdullah ibn as Salam believe in the Qur’ān as well, because of what they find of its description in their books. And from among the idolaters are also those who believe in this Qur’ān. Only those who are habituated to rejection and denial disbelieve in My signs, despite their clarity."
"You did not read any Scripture before this, nor wrote one with your right hand, or else these dissemblers would have found a cause to doubt it.",47,29,وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُوا۟ مِن قَبْلِهِۦ مِن كِتَٰبٍ وَلَا تَخُطُّهُۥ بِيَمِينِكَ إِذًا لَّٱرْتَابَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,"O Messenger! You never read any book before the Qur’ān, nor did you write anything with your hand because you are unlettered and cannot read or write. Had you been able to read and write, the ignorant people would have doubted your messengership and used it as an excuse to say you were relating from the previous Books."
"In fact, in the minds of those who have intelligence these are clear signs. No one denies Our revelations except those who are unjust.",48,29,بَلْ هُوَ ءَايَٰتٌۢ بَيِّنَٰتٌ فِى صُدُورِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَّا ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"Nay, the Qur’ān that has been revealed to you consists of clear verses which are preserved within the hearts of those believers granted knowledge. Only those who wrong themselves by ascribing partners with Allah and rejecting Him, deny My verses."
"For they say: ""How Is it no signs were sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say: ""The signs are with God. I am only a warner, plain and simple.""",49,29,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَٰتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْءَايَٰتُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"The idolaters said, “Why have no miracles been given to Muhammad from his Lord, like those miracles given to the messengers before him?” O Messenger! say to them: “Miracles are only in the control of Allah, may He be glorified; He grants them whenever He wishes. It is not in my power to bring them; I am only a clear warner to you of the punishment of Allah.”"
Is it not sufficient for them that We have revealed the Book to you which is read out to them? It is indeed a grace and reminder for people who believe.,50,29,أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَىٰ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"O Messenger! Is it not sufficient for these people who propose miracles, that we have revealed the Qur’ān upon you which it recited to them? Indeed, in the Qur’ān is mercy and exhortation to believing people, because they are the ones who truly benefit from whatever it contains. Therefore, whatever has been revealed to them is better than that which they suggest should be sent down: similar to what was sent to Messengers previously."
"Say: ""God is sufficient as witness between me and you."" He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. It is those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God who will perish.",51,29,قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ شَهِيدًا يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَكَفَرُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"O Messenger! Say: “Allah, may He be glorified, is enough as a witness to my truthfulness in what I convey, and to your rejection of it. He knows everything that is in the heavens and everything that is on Earth; nothing is hidden from Him. As for those who bring faith upon falsehood in worshipping anything instead of Allah, whilst rejecting the being who alone is worthy of worship, they are the true losers because of them choosing disbelief over belief."
"They want you to hasten the punishment: But for a time already determined the punishment would have come upon them. It will come upon them all too suddenly, and they will be caught unawares.",52,29,وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَوْلَآ أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى لَّجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَيَأْتِيَنَّهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"O Messenger! The idolaters want for you to bring quickly the punishment you warned them of. Had it not been for Allah already having decreed an unmovable time for their punishment, it would definitely have come upon them. And it will come upon them suddenly, when they do not expect it to."
They want you to hasten the punishment: Hell will indeed surround the unbelievers.,53,29,يَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌۢ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"They want you to bring the punishment you warned them of quickly. Indeed, the hellfire Allah has warned the disbelievers of will surround them; they will not be able to escape its torment."
"The day the punishment comes upon them from above and underneath their feet, (God will) say: ""And now taste of what you had done.""",54,29,يَوْمَ يَغْشَىٰهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ذُوقُوا۟ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"On the day when the punishment will cover them from above and will be spread under their feet, Allah will say to them, rebuking them, “Taste the requital of the idolatry and sins you used to commit!”"
"O My creatures who believe, surely My earth has plenty of scope and so worship only Me.",55,29,يَٰعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ أَرْضِى وَٰسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّٰىَ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,"“O my servants! Emigrate from the land in which you are unable to worship Me. Indeed, My land is vast, so worship Me alone and do not ascribe anyone as partner to Me.”"
Every soul has to know the taste of death. You will then be sent back to Us.,56,29,كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ,"“Let not the fear of death prevent you from emigrating. Every soul shall taste death, and then to Me alone you shall return on the Day of Judgment to give account and be requited.”"
"We shall admit those who believe and do the right to empyreal gardens with rivers rippling by, where they will abide for ever. How excellent the guerdon of those who toil,",57,29,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَنُبَوِّئَنَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ غُرَفًا تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا نِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَٰمِلِينَ,"Those who have faith in Allah and perform good deeds through which they draw closer, I will accomodate them in raised dwellings under which rivers flow, wherein they shall reside forever. How great is this reward of those who live in obedience to Allah!"
Who persevere and place their trust in their Lord.,58,29,ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,"How great is the reward of those who act in the obedience of Allah and remain steadfast on it while refraining from His disobedience, and upon Him alone do they rely in all their affairs."
How many living things there are on the earth that do not Store their food; God provides them as well as you. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.,59,29,وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَآبَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا ٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"All creatures - despite their innumerability - that are incapable of storing their own provisions, Allah sustains them and you. Therefore not emigrating out of fear of starvation is not a valid excuse for you. He is the hearer of your statements and knower of your intentions and actions; none of them are hidden from Him, and He shall requite you for them."
"If you ask them: ""Who created the heavens and the earth, and who set the sun and the moon to work?"" They will answer: ""God."" Why then do they vacillate?",60,29,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"O Messenger! If you ask these idolaters, “Who created the heavens and the earth? Who put the sun and moon into orbit, such that they come after each other?” they will say, “Allah is the one who created the heavens and the earth, and put the sun and moon into constant orbit.” How then can they turn away from bringing faith in only Allah to the worship of deities instead of Him that do not bring benefit nor cause harm?"
"God increases the means of those of His creatures as He please, or limits them for whomsoever He will. He is certainly cognisant of everything.",61,29,ٱللَّهُ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَقْدِرُ لَهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah expands the sustenance for whoever He wishes from His servants and constricts it for whoever He wishes; this is due to wisdom only He is aware of. Indeed, Allah knows everything; no solution required for His servants is hidden from Him."
"If you ask them: ""Who sends down rain from the sky and quickens the earth when it is dead?"" They will answer: ""God."" Say: ""All praise be to God."" But most of them do not understand.",62,29,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"And O Messenger! If you were to ask the idolaters, “Who is it that causes the rain to descend from the sky, and consequently causes the earth to grow after it became barren?” they would definitely say, “Allah is the one who causes the rain to fall from the sky and the earth to grow because of it.” O Messenger! Say: “All praise is for Allah who has made the evidence clear against you!” However, the crux of the matter is that the majority of them will not understand, because if they were to understand they would not worship idols that do not benefit or harm them."
"The life of this world is only a sport and play. It is surely the home of the Hereafter that will indeed be life extended and new, if only they knew!",63,29,وَمَا هَٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا لَهْوٌ وَلَعِبٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلدَّارَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ لَهِىَ ٱلْحَيَوَانُ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"This worldly life with all its temptations and enjoyments, is only amusement and play for those who are attached to it; it will expire quickly. Indeed, the abode of the afterlife is the real life, due to it being eternal. If only they knew, they would not have given preference to that which is temporary, over that which is eternal."
"When they board a ship they call on God, placing their faith wholly in Him. But when He brings them safely back to shore, they begin to associate others with Him,",64,29,فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا۟ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّىٰهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,"When the idolaters board ships and sail the ocean, they call out to Allah alone, sincerely supplicating to Him to save them from drowning. After Allah saves them from drowning, they return to their idolatry, calling out to their idols together with Him."
"And deny what We had given them, in order to go on enjoying themselves. They will come to know soon.",65,29,لِيَكْفُرُوا۟ بِمَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ وَلِيَتَمَتَّعُوا۟ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,They return to their idolatry so that they can continue showing ingratitude for My favours upon them and so that they can carry on enjoying the beauty of the worldly life. They will soon know the evil punishment that awaits them when they die.
"Do they not see that We have given them a safe sanctuary, while all around them men are being despoiled? Do they then believe what is false, and deny the bounty of God?",66,29,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا ءَامِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ ٱلنَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ أَفَبِٱلْبَٰطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ يَكْفُرُونَ,"Do these people who reject the blessings of Allah upon them not see another blessing of His after He saves them from drowning, that He made a sanctuary for them in which their lives and wealth are secure? This is while those around them are raided, killed, looted, and taken captive together with their wives and children. Do they still believe in their false deities and reject the bounties of Allah, not showing Him gratitude for them?"
"Who is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie about God, or denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not an abode for unbelievers in Hell?",67,29,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُۥٓ أَلَيْسَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"There is no one more oppressive than the one who fabricates a lie with regards to Allah by attributing a partner to Him, or by rejecting the truth that His Messenger has brought to him. Undoubtedly there is an abode in Hell for the disbelievers, and those like them."
We shall guide those who strive in Our cause to the paths leading straight to Us. Surely God is with those who do good.,68,29,وَٱلَّذِينَ جَٰهَدُوا۟ فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمَعَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"And those who strive hard in My cause, seeking My pleasure, I will certainly grant them the ability to tread the straight path. Indeed, Allah is with those who do good by helping, assisting and guiding them."
ALIF LAM MIM.,0,30,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓ,Alif Lam Meem. The discussion on similar letters has already passed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
The Romans have been conquered,1,30,غُلِبَتِ ٱلرُّومُ,The Persians have defeated the Romans.
In the neighbouring land. But having been conquered they will conquer,2,30,فِىٓ أَدْنَى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ,"In the nearer lands of Levant. The Romans, after their defeat will be vitorious over them again."
In a few years (less than ten). God's is the imperative first and last. On that day the believers will rejoice,3,30,فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِنۢ بَعْدُ وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَفْرَحُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"Within a time period not before three years and not after ten. To Allah belongs the command, prior to the Roman’s victory and after it. And on the day the Romans defeat the Persians, the believers will be happy."
"In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all-mighty, ever-merciful.",4,30,بِنَصْرِ ٱللَّهِ يَنصُرُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"They will be happy because of the help of Allah being with the Romans due to them being the people of the book. Allah helps whoever He wishes against whoever He wishes; He is the Almighty who cannot be overcome, the Merciful towards His believing servants."
It is a promise of God; and God does not go back on His promise. Yet most men do not understand:,5,30,وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ لَا يُخْلِفُ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُۥ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"This victory was a promise from Allah, and with its fulfilment, the believers will increase in their conviction of Allah’s promise of victory being true. As for the majority of people, they do not understand this due to their disbelief."
"They only know the palpable life of this world, and are oblivious of the Hereafter.",6,30,يَعْلَمُونَ ظَٰهِرًا مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ غَٰفِلُونَ,"They do not know faith and the rulings of the Shariah; they only know of the superficial matters of worldly life, related to earning a livelihood, whilst they turn away from the real life of the afterlife, not paying any attention to it."
Do they not think for themselves that God did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them without reason and a determined purpose? But many men reject the meeting with their Lord.,7,30,أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِم مَّا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِلِقَآئِ رَبِّهِمْ لَكَٰفِرُونَ,"Do these rejecting idolaters not ponder in themselves as to how Allah has created them and arranged them together in their most complete forms? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth except for a just cause; He did not create them in vain and He appointed a fixed time for their existence in the world. Indeed, many people reject the meeting of their Lord on the Day of Judgement, and that is why they are not prepared for the resurrection by doing good deeds which are acceptable to their Lord."
"Have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end? They were far more powerful than them, furrowed the earth and colonised it far more than they; and their apostles came to them with visible signs. It was surely not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves.",8,30,أَوَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُوٓا۟ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَثَارُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَعَمَرُوهَآ أَكْثَرَ مِمَّا عَمَرُوهَا وَجَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"Do these people not travel the earth so that they can ponder over what the outcome of the nations who rejected Allah before them was? Those nations were much stronger than them; they adapted the land for farming and construction, and populated it much more than these people have. Their Messengers brought clear proofs and evidences for the oneness of Allah but they were rejected. So when Allah punished them, He was not oppressive, rather they themselves were oppressive by leading themselves to destruction by disbelief."
"Therefore evil was the end of those who did evil, for they denied the signs of God and made fun of them.",9,30,ثُمَّ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسَٰٓـُٔوا۟ ٱلسُّوٓأَىٰٓ أَن كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانُوا۟ بِهَا يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"Then, the outcome of those who did evil deeds i.e. idolatry and sins, was an extremely evil outcome. It was because they rejected the signs of Allah and would mock at and make fun of them."
"God originates creation, and then will revert it, then you will go back to Him.",10,30,ٱللَّهُ يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Allah starts the creation without any previous example, then He causes it to die, then will resurrect it. Then to Him alone will you return to be accounted for and requited on the Day of Judgement."
The day the Resurrection comes the sinners will be overwhelmed with despair.,11,30,وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يُبْلِسُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"On the day when the hour arrives, the criminals shall lose hope in the mercy of Allah and their hopes in Allah's mercy will end just as their arguments/excuses will end."
"No intercessor will they have among those they associated (with God), and will reject their partners.",12,30,وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُم مِّن شُرَكَآئِهِمْ شُفَعَٰٓؤُا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ بِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ كَٰفِرِينَ,"They will not have anyone to intercede for them from those whom they used to worship besides Allah will not intercede for them, to save them from the punishment. Rather, they will reject one another. The idolaters will reject those they used to worship due to them forsakening them in their time of need; they are all equal in being doomed."
The day the Hour comes they will be separated into categories.,13,30,وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَفَرَّقُونَ,"And on the day the hour arrives, the people will all be divided in requital according to their deeds in the world. Some will be elevated to the highest ranks, while others will be demoted to the lowest of the low."
"Those who believed and did the right will be feasted in a rich, well-watered meadow.",14,30,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَهُمْ فِى رَوْضَةٍ يُحْبَرُونَ,"As for those who have faith in Allah and did good deeds pleasing to Him, they will be in paradise, happy with whatever everlasting bounties they find within it."
"Those who did not believe and rejected Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter, will be given over to punishment.",15,30,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَلِقَآئِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ مُحْضَرُونَ,"As for those who disbelieve in Allah and reject His verses that were revealed to His Messengers, the resurrection and the accounting, they are the ones who will constantly punished."
"So extol God when the evening comes and the day dawns,",16,30,فَسُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونَ,"So glorify Allah when you enter the night, the time of the two night prayers: Al-Maghrib and Al-‘Ishā, and also glorify Him when you enter the morning: the time of the Fajr prayer."
"For His is the praise in the heavens and the earth, -- and at nightfall and the time of noon.",17,30,وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَعَشِيًّا وَحِينَ تُظْهِرُونَ,"And for Allah, may He be glorified, is all praise; the angels praise Him in the heavens and His creations praise Him on Earth. And glorify Him when you enter the evening: the time of the ‘Asr prayer, together with glorifying Him at the time of Aẓ-Ẓuhr."
"He brings the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and quickens the earth after it had died. So will you be brought forth (from the dead).",18,30,يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَىَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَىِّ وَيُحْىِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَكَذَٰلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ,"He extracts the living from the dead, like His extracting a human from a drop of semen and a chick from an egg. He also extracts the dead from the living, like His extracting a drop of semen from a human and an egg from a chicken. He revives the earth after it has become dry by sending down rain and regrowing it. Likewise you will be resurrected from your graves for accountability and requital."
"Among His signs is that He created you from the earth, and you are now human beings dispersed everywhere.",19,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ أَنْ خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ إِذَآ أَنتُم بَشَرٌ تَنتَشِرُونَ,"From among the great signs of Allah which prove His power and oneness, is that He created you - O people! - from earth when He created your father from clay, then you soon became many humans increasing through reproduction, and spreading over the earth’s east and west."
"Another of His signs is that He created mates of your own kind of yourselves so that you may get peace of mind from them, and has put love and compassion between you. Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.",20,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ أَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا لِّتَسْكُنُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"From also from among the great signs of Allah which prove His power and oneness, is that He created for you - O men! - wives from among your species so that you may find contentment in them due to your special compatibility, and He put love and affection between you. Indeed, in the aforementioned are clear proofs and evidences for people who contemplate, because they are the ones who benefit by using their intellect."
"Among other signs of His is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variety of your tongues and complexions. Surely there are signs in this for those who understand.",21,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَٰفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَٰنِكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّلْعَٰلِمِينَ,"From among His great signs which prove His power and oneness, is that He created the heavens and the earth, and your different languages and skin colours. Indeed, in the aforementioned are proofs and evidences for the people of knowledge and insight."
"Another of His signs is the night, a time for you to sleep, and the day to seek His bounty. Verily there are signs in this for those who pay heed.",22,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ مَنَامُكُم بِٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱبْتِغَآؤُكُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,"From among His great signs which prove His power and oneness, is your sleeping by night and wakefulness by day, so that you may rest from the tiredness of your work. And from among His signs is that He made the day so that you may disperse, seeking sustenance from your Lord. Indeed, in the aforementioned are proofs and evidences for people who listen attentively while contemplating and accepting."
"Another of His signs is the lightning He shows to fill you both with dread and hope, and the water He sends down from the sky which reawakens the earth that was dead. There are indeed signs in this for those who have sense.",23,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ يُرِيكُمُ ٱلْبَرْقَ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَيُحْىِۦ بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"From among His great signs which prove His power and oneness, is that He shows you the lightening in the sky, and combines within it fear of the thunderclaps and hope of rain. He also sends down rainwater for you from the heavens, and revives the earth by the regrowth of plants after it has dried up. Indeed, in that are clear proofs and evidences for understanding people, so that they may draw conclusions by it on resurrection after death for accountability and requital."
Another of His signs is that the heavens and the earth stay in position by His command; and then when He will call you once you will come out of the earth.,24,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ أَن تَقُومَ ٱلسَّمَآءُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِۦ ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ,"And from among the signs of Allah which prove His power and oneness, is the upstanding of the sky without it falling and the earth not falling apart due to His command. Then, when He will call you once from the earth by the angel blowing the trumpet, you will suddenly emerge from your graves to give account and be requited."
"All those who are in the heavens and the earth are His, and they are all obedient to Him.",25,30,وَلَهُۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُۥ قَٰنِتُونَ,"And to Allah alone belongs whoever is in heavens and the earth, Allah created them, owns them and has full control over them. Everyone of His creations in the heavens and the earth are obedient to Him and submissive to His command."
It is He who first creates and then reverts it. This is how His law works inevitably. His semblance is of the most sublime in the heavens and the earth. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,26,30,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يَبْدَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَهُ ٱلْمَثَلُ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"He is the one who initiates the creation without there being anything like it before, then he resurrects it after making it expire. Bringing it back is easier than initiating it, but both are easy for Him because whenever He intends something, He says “Be!” and it happens. For Him Mighty and Majestic is the highest of praise in whatever qualities of majesty and perfection he is praised with. He is the almighty who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His creation and decree."
"He gives you an example from your own life: Do you possess among your dependants any partners in what We have bestowed on you, so that you and they have equal (share) in it, and that you fear them as you fear each other? That is how We explain Our signs clearly for those who comprehend.",27,30,ضَرَبَ لَكُم مَّثَلًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ هَل لَّكُم مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُم مِّن شُرَكَآءَ فِى مَا رَزَقْنَٰكُمْ فَأَنتُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ تَخَافُونَهُمْ كَخِيفَتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"O idolaters! Allah mentions an example for you of yourselves: do you have partners from your slaves who are equals to you in everything you own, such that you fear them just as you fear each other? Would you be happy for yourselves with your slaves being such? No doubt, you would not be happy with such an arrangement, so Allah is more worthy that He does not have a partner from His creation in His kingdom. Like that example and in other ways, Allah clearly explains different proofs and evidences for understanding people, because they are the ones who benefit from them."
And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding. Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray? None will they have to help them.,28,30,بَلِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَهْوَآءَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ فَمَن يَهْدِى مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"Their deviance is not because of any deficiency in proofs, nor of them not being explained, it is only because of following desires and their forefathers. So who is there that is capable of guiding those whom Allah has caused to deviate? No one is capable of it. There will have no helpers to prevent the punishment from them."
"So keep yourself exclusively on the true way, the creational law of God according to which He created man with the quality of choosing right or wrong. There is no altering of God's creation. This is the supreme law. But most men do not understand.",29,30,فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا فِطْرَتَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِى فَطَرَ ٱلنَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger! Turn your face, you and those with you, directing it towards the True Religion which Allah has directed you, turning away from all other religions: the religion of Islam upon which Allah intrinsically created people. There is no changing the creation of Allah, it is the correct and upright religion in which there is no deviation, but the majority of people do not know this."
"Turn towards Him and be dutiful to Him; be firm in devotion, and do not become an idolater,",30,30,مُنِيبِينَ إِلَيْهِ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"And return to Him, may He be glorified, by repenting from your sins, be mindful of Him by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions, perform prayer with perfection, and do not be from the idolaters who go against nature and ascribe partners with Allah by worshipping them."
"(Or) one of those who created rifts in their order and are divided into sects, with each group exulting in what it has (carved out for itself) --",31,30,مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا۟ شِيَعًا كُلُّ حِزْبٍۭ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ,"And do not be from those idolaters who changed their religion, believing in some of it and rejecting other parts of it. They split into groups and sects, each sect happy with whatever falsehood they were on, thinking that they alone were upon the truth and others were on falsehood."
When misfortune befalls men they pray to their Lord and turn to Him; but afterwards when He has given them a taste of His benevolence a section of them begins to ascribe compeers to their Lord,32,30,وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلنَّاسَ ضُرٌّ دَعَوْا۟ رَبَّهُم مُّنِيبِينَ إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَآ أَذَاقَهُم مِّنْهُ رَحْمَةً إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,"When the idolaters are afflicted by a difficulty i.e. poverty, drought, they supplicate only to their Lord, may He be glorified, returning to Him humbling themselves and seeking refuge in Him to remove the affliction from them. Then, when He shows them mercy by removing whatever afflicted them, they return to their ways of idolatry by supplicating to others along with Him."
So as to deny what We have given them. Please yourselves for a time; you will come to know soon.,33,30,لِيَكْفُرُوا۟ بِمَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ فَتَمَتَّعُوا۟ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"They do so to reject the bounties of Allah, from amongst them is removing their difficulty. So those who ascribe partners to Me should enjoy the ease they have in this life for surely they will come to know on the Day of Judgement that they were in clear misguidance."
Have We sent down a charter to them which mentions what they associate with Him?,34,30,أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَٰنًا فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يُشْرِكُونَ,"What invited them to ascribing partners with Allah when they have no proof supporting it? I did not send any evidence to them in the form of any scripture which they could use as proof for their ascribing partners with Allah, nor do they have any scripture which talks in favour of their idolatry and upholds the validity of the disbelief they are on."
"When We give men a taste of Our benevolence they start rejoicing in it. When misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have done themselves, they begin to despair.",35,30,وَإِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلنَّاسَ رَحْمَةً فَرِحُوا۟ بِهَا وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌۢ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَقْنَطُونَ,"And when I give the people a taste of some of My bounties, i.e. health and wealth, they become happy with it; a happiness based on arrogance and pride. And if something that harms them reaches them, i.e. illness or poverty due to the sins they commit, they begin losing hope in the mercy of Allah and in the difficulty going away from them."
Do they not see God increases or decreases the means of whosoever He please? Verily there are signs in this for those who believe.,36,30,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Do they not see that Allah expands the sustenance for whichever of His servants He wishes, testing them to see whether they show gratitude or ingratitude? And He constrains sustenance upon whomsoever He wishes, testing to see whether they are patience or become angry. Indeed, in the increasing of provision for some, and its constriction upon others, are proofs of the kindness and mercy of Allah."
"So, give their share to the relatives, the needy, and the wayfarers. This is best for those who seek the way that leads to God, and they will be successful.",37,30,فَـَٔاتِ ذَا ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُۥ وَٱلْمِسْكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"O Muslim! Give the relative whatever goodness and kinship he deserves, give the needy whatever he can fulfil his need with and help the stranger whose path back home has been cut off. Giving in these causes is better for those who seek the pleasure of Allah; those who give priority to this kind of assistance and rights are the ones who succeed by achieving their objective of paradise, and being granted safety from the feared punishment."
"What you give on interest to increase (your capital) through others' wealth, does not find increase with God; yet what you give (in alms and charity) with a pure heart, seeking the way of God, will be doubled.",38,30,وَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُم مِّن رِّبًا لِّيَرْبُوَا۟ فِىٓ أَمْوَٰلِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَلَا يَرْبُوا۟ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُم مِّن زَكَوٰةٍ تُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُضْعِفُونَ,"Whatever wealth you give to anyone with the expectation that they will.return it to you with an increase, that wealth does not grow with Allah. And whatever wealth you give to fulfil someone's need, desiring only the pleasure of Allah, and not praise or reward from the people, the reward of that deed shall be multiplied for you by Allah."
"It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life. Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things? Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him!",39,30,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ رَزَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُم مَّن يَفْعَلُ مِن ذَٰلِكُم مِّن شَىْءٍ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"Allah Himself is the one who alone created you, then granted you sustenance, then will cause you to die, then revive you for the resurrection. Is there any of your idols which you worship that can do any of the above? He is far above and free of what the idolaters say and believe."
Corruption has spread over land and sea from what men have done themselves that they may taste a little of what they have done: They may haply come back (to the right path).,40,30,ظَهَرَ ٱلْفَسَادُ فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِى ٱلنَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى عَمِلُوا۟ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"Corruption has appeared in the land and sea in the lives of people by their span becoming shorter, and in their bodies by way of diseases and illnesses, due to the sins they commit. It has become apparent so that Allah may give them a taste of some of their evil deeds in the worldly life, perhaps they repent to Him."
"Say: ""Travel on the earth and see how came the end of those before you."" Most of them were idolaters.",41,30,قُلْ سِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلُ كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّشْرِكِينَ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “Travel the earth and ponder over what the outcome of the rejecting nations before you was. Their outcome was an evil one; the majority of them would ascribe partners with Allah, worshipping others with Him, and they were destroyed because of it.”"
So set your face towards the straight path before the day arrives from God which is irreversible. Men will be segregated on that day.,42,30,فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ ٱلْقَيِّمِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لَّا مَرَدَّ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصَّدَّعُونَ,"O Messenger! Turn your face in the direction of the correct religion of Islam in which there is no deviation, before the Day of Judgment comes. When it comes, there will be no one to prevent it, and on that day people will be divided: one group shall be pampered in paradise, while the other shall be punished in the hellfire."
"So that he who disbelieves will bear the consequence of his unbelief; and he who does the right will straighten out the way for himself,",43,30,مَن كَفَرَ فَعَلَيْهِ كُفْرُهُۥ وَمَنْ عَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلِأَنفُسِهِمْ يَمْهَدُونَ,"Whoever disbelieves in Allah, the harm of his disbelief - which is permanent residence in the hellfire - will reach only himself. As for those who do good deeds seeking Allah’s pleasure through them, they are preparing for themselves entry into paradise and deriving enjoyment from whatever is within it, and they shall live in it forever."
"So that God may reward those who believed and did what was good, by His grace. Surely He does not love unbelievers.",44,30,لِيَجْزِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Allah will separate the people and divide them into two groups, so that He can reward those who have faith in Allah and perform good deeds that He is pleased with. Indeed, He does not love those who disbelieve in Him and His Messengers. Rather, He hates them severely and will punish them on the Day of Judgement."
"Among His signs are the breezes He sends as harbingers of happy news, so that He may allow you to taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and you may seek of His bounty, and may haply be grateful.",45,30,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ أَن يُرْسِلَ ٱلرِّيَاحَ مُبَشِّرَٰتٍ وَلِيُذِيقَكُم مِّن رَّحْمَتِهِۦ وَلِتَجْرِىَ ٱلْفُلْكُ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"And from His great signs that prove His power and oneness is that He sends winds that give glad tidings of imminent rain to the servants, and so that He may give you - O people! - a taste of His mercy by the greenery and ease that follows the rainfall. And also so that the ships can sail the sea by His will and you can seek from His grace by trading across the ocean. Perhaps you will show gratitude upon the favours of Allah so He may increase you in them."
"Verily We sent many apostles before you to their people, who brought clear signs with them. Then We retributed those who were sinful. It is a duty incumbent on Us to help the believers.",46,30,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ رُسُلًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَآءُوهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا۟ وَكَانَ حَقًّا عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"O Messenger! Verily, I have sent many Messengers to their people before you, so they brought miracles proving their truthfulness but the people rejected whatever their Messengers brought to them. So, we took retribution from those committed evil and destroyed them with My punishment, saving the Messengers and those who brought faith in them from destruction. It is a right I have obligated upon myself to rescue the believers and help them."
"It is God who sends the breezes that raise clouds, then spreads them over the sky as He please, fold on fold, then you see the drops of rain issue from between them. When He sends it down to those of His creatures as He will, they are filled with joy,",47,30,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُۥ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُۥ كِسَفًا فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَٰلِهِۦ فَإِذَآ أَصَابَ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦٓ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,"Allah, may He be glorified, is the one who sends the winds and drives them. Those winds gather and move the clouds, stretching them in the sky however He wishes, either little or large; He also makes them into pieces sometimes. O observer! You then see the rain coming from within it, so when the rain reaches whichever of His servants He wishes, they become happy with the mercy of Allah upon them in the form of rainfall that will cause the earth to grow that which they and their livestock need."
Although before it came down they were despondent.,48,30,وَإِن كَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن قَبْلِهِۦ لَمُبْلِسِينَ,"While just previously, they had been losing hope in any rain falling upon them."
So consider the signs of His benevolence: How He quickens the earth after it had become waste. He is verily the one who will raise the dead. He has power over everything.,49,30,فَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِ رَحْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ كَيْفَ يُحْىِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O Messenger! Look at the effects of the rainfall that Allah sends out of mercy for His servants; how Allah revives the earth with the various plants that grow after it had dried up and become barren. Indeed, the being who revived that dry earth is the one who will resurrect the dead as living; He is capable of everything, nothing is beyond His power and ability."
"If We send a (blighting) wind and they see (the earth) seared autumnal, they would surely become ungrateful.",50,30,وَلَئِنْ أَرْسَلْنَا رِيحًا فَرَأَوْهُ مُصْفَرًّا لَّظَلُّوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ يَكْفُرُونَ,"If we were to send upon their farms and crops a wind which would spoil them, and they were to then see their crops yellow in colour after they had previously been green, they would then begin to show ingratitude to the numerous other bounties of Allah they were given before that."
"You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated,",51,30,فَإِنَّكَ لَا تُسْمِعُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَلَا تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا وَلَّوْا۟ مُدْبِرِينَ,"So just as you are incapable of making the dead and deaf hear, after they have distanced themselves from you to emphasise their inability to hear you, likewise you cannot guide those who are similar to them if they turn away and do not benefit."
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.,52,30,وَمَآ أَنتَ بِهَٰدِ ٱلْعُمْىِ عَن ضَلَٰلَتِهِمْ إِن تُسْمِعُ إِلَّا مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا فَهُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"You are not able to guide those who have deviated from the straight path, onto treading the right path. Neither are you able to make anyone hear something beneficial to them, except those who believe in My Verses, because only they are the ones who will benefit from whatever you say; they are the ones submissive and accepting of My command."
"It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair. Surely He makes whatever He wills. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.",53,30,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُم مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةً ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفًا وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْقَدِيرُ,"O people! Allah is the one who created you from a despised fluid, then He gave you the strength of manhood after the weakness of childhood, then gave you the weakness of old age after the strength of manhood. Allah creates whatever He wishes i.e. strength and weakness; He is he Knower of everything, nothing is hidden from Him; the Capable nothing is beyond His power and ability."
"The day Resurrection is set the sinners will swear: ""We did not tarry more than an hour (and cannot be guilty)."" That is how they have always been deceived.",54,30,وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُوا۟ غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ كَذَٰلِكَ كَانُوا۟ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"On the day judgement shall occur, the criminals will swear that had not been in their graves except a very short period of time. Likewise they were deluded in the world by denying the truth."
"But those who were given the knowledge and belief will say: ""You have tarried, according to the Book of God, as long as the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but 'you do not know.""",55,30,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَٱلْإِيمَٰنَ لَقَدْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْبَعْثِ فَهَٰذَا يَوْمُ ٱلْبَعْثِ وَلَٰكِنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ,"Those prophets and angels to whom Allah has granted knowledge will say, “You remained for as long as Allah decreed according to His infinite knowledge, until the day of your resurrection which you would deny, but you did not know that the resurrection was a reality and so you rejected it.”"
"Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour.",56,30,فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا يَنفَعُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,"So on the day when Allah shall resurrect all creations to give account and be requited, all the excuses the wrongdoers made up will not benefit them, and it will not be asked of them to now please Allah by repenting, because of the time for it having expired."
"We have offered every kind of example here in this Qur'an to men. Even then if you bring a verse to them, those who disbelieve say: ""You are nothing but a liar.""",57,30,وَلَقَدْ ضَرَبْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِى هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ وَلَئِن جِئْتَهُم بِـَٔايَةٍ لَّيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا مُبْطِلُونَ,"And verily, taking the people into consideration, I have mentioned every type of example for them in this Qur’ān, so that the truth becomes clearly distinguished to them from falsehood. O Messenger! If you were to bring to them a clear proof of your truthfulness, those who disbelieve in Allah would say, “You only bring futile things!”"
That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not know.,58,30,كَذَٰلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,Allah seals and misguides the heart of those who purposely reject the signs you bring them. Likewise Allah seals the heart of every disbeliever of the truth.
So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).,59,30,فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَا يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُوقِنُونَ,"O Messenger! Bear patience on the rejection of your people of you. Indeed, Allah’s promise to you of help and establishment no doubt remains. Let not those who do not believe they are going to be resurrected, lead you to become hasty and impatient."
ALIF LAM MIM.,0,31,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓ,Alif Lam Meem. The discussion on similar letters has already passed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"These are the verses of the sagacious Book,",1,31,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,O Messenger! These verses that have been revealed to you are verses of the book full of wisdom.
"And a guidance and grace for those who do good,",2,31,هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"It is guidance and mercy for those who do good, by fulfilling the rights of their Lord and His servants."
"Who are constant in devotion, pay the zakat, and are certain of the Hereafter.",3,31,ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,"Those who perform prayer in the most complete manner and give Zakat of their wealth, and they are convinced of the resurrection, account and reward in the afterlife."
"They are on guidance from their Lord, and will prosper.",4,31,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"Those who possess those characteristics are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are successful by gaining whatever they seek and being distanced from what they fear."
"But among men are also those who spread frivolous stories to mislead (others) from the way of God, without any knowledge, and take it lightly. For such as these the nemesis will be shameful.",5,31,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْتَرِى لَهْوَ ٱلْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّخِذَهَا هُزُوًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"There are people - like An-Naḍr bin Al-Ḥārith - who take up stories to distract people away from the religion of Allah inconspicuously, and take the verses of Allah as a joke, mocking them. Those who possess these characteristics have a humiliating punishment awaiting them in the afterlife."
"When Our verses are recited before them they turn away haughtily as though they did not hear them, as if a deafness had come into their ears. So give them tidings of a shameful punishment.",6,31,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَٰتُنَا وَلَّىٰ مُسْتَكْبِرًا كَأَن لَّمْ يَسْمَعْهَا كَأَنَّ فِىٓ أُذُنَيْهِ وَقْرًا فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"When you read My verses to him, he turns away in arrogance, as if he has not heard them; as if his ears are deaf to sounds. So O Messenger! Warn him of a painful punishment which awaits him!"
Surely for those who believe and do the right are pleasure gardens.,7,31,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتُ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Indeed, those who have faith and do good deeds will have gardens of bounties, in which they shall live in luxury among everything Allah has prepared for them."
They will abide in them for ever. The promise of God is true; and He is all-mighty and all-wise.,8,31,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقًّا وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"They will remain therein. Allah has promised that to them, a true promise in which there is no doubt. He is the Almighty who no one can overcome; the Wise in His creation, decree and legislation."
"He created the skies without a support, as you can see, and placed stabilisers in the earth that you may dwell at ease as it revolves; and dispersed on it all varieties of creatures, and He sent down water from the skies and grew all kinds of splendid things upon it.",9,31,خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا وَأَلْقَىٰ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ رَوَٰسِىَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنۢبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ,"Allah, may He be glorified, created the heavens which are raised without any pillars, pitched mountains on Earth firmly, so that they do not shake with you, dispersed animals over the earth, and sent down rainfall from the sky, causing the earth to grow all kinds of delightful plants, from which both the humans and animals benefit."
Such is God's creation. Show me now what those (they worship) beside Him have created. Surely the evil-doers are in clear error.,10,31,هَٰذَا خَلْقُ ٱللَّهِ فَأَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِۦ بَلِ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"O idolaters! The aforementioned is all the creation of Allah, so show Me what those you worship other than Allah have created. Rather, the wrongdoers are in clear deviance from the truth, because they attribute such objects to Allah that cannot create anything, but are themselves created."
"We bestowed wisdom on Luqman that he may be grateful to God. Whosoever is grateful is so for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful (should remember) that God is above all concern, worthy of praise.",11,31,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا لُقْمَٰنَ ٱلْحِكْمَةَ أَنِ ٱشْكُرْ لِلَّهِ وَمَن يَشْكُرْ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ,"Verily, I granted Luqman the understanding of religion and correctness in matters, and I told him, “O Luqman! Be grateful to your Lord for the blessing of being able to obey Him He has bestowed upon you. Whoever is grateful to his Lord, his gratefulness benefits only himself for Allah is not dependant upon it, and whoever rejects His blessings, the harm of his rejection afflicts him alone, for his rejection does not hurt Allah in the slightest; indeed Allah is totally independent of His creation and praiseworthy in every condition.”"
"(Remember) when Luqman counselled his son: ""O son, do not associate any one with God. To associate others with God is a grievous wrong.""",12,31,وَإِذْ قَالَ لُقْمَٰنُ لِٱبْنِهِۦ وَهُوَ يَعِظُهُۥ يَٰبُنَىَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱلشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ,"O Messenger! Remember when Luqman said to his son, encouraging him to do good and warning him from evil, “O my son! Do not worship any of the creation along with Allah; indeed the worship of a deity besides Allah is a grave injustice on the self, and is a cause for permanently staying in the hellfire.”"
"We have committed man about his parents. His mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility, weaning him in two years. So he should be grateful to Me and his parents. To Me is the journeying back.",13,31,وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ بِوَٰلِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُۥ وَهْنًا عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ وَفِصَٰلُهُۥ فِى عَامَيْنِ أَنِ ٱشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَٰلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"And I commanded the human to obey his parents and do good towards them in matters that do not lead to the disobedience of Allah. His mother carried him in her womb having to face difficulty upon difficulty, weaning him off breastfeeding within two years. I told him: “Be grateful to Allah for every blessing He has bestowed upon you, then be grateful to your parents for their care and upbringing of you. To Me alone is your return, upon which I shall requite each person as he deserves.”"
"If they try to force you to associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me. Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did.",14,31,وَإِن جَٰهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰٓ أَن تُشْرِكَ بِى مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا وَٱتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَىَّ ثُمَّ إِلَىَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And even if your parents strive to incite you upon ascribing partners to Allah according to their ignorant/arbitrary understanding - like what the mother of Sa‘d bin Abī Waqqāṣ did to him - then do not obey them in that, because there is no obedience to the creation in the disobedience to the Creator. Rather, live with them in the world with goodness, maintaining ties and friendship. And follow the path of those who proclaim My oneness repeatedly and obey Me; to Me alone is your return on the Day of Judgment so that I may tell you of the actions you used to do in the world and requite you for them."
"""O my son, whatsoever it may be, even though equal to a mustard seed in weight, or within a rock or in the sky or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily God is perceptive, all-aware.",15,31,يَٰبُنَىَّ إِنَّهَآ إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ فَتَكُن فِى صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ أَوْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ,"O my son! Indeed, evil and good, no matter how small, even if they equal to the weight of a mustard seed and are in the middle of a rock so no one is aware, or in any place in the heavens or earth, Allah will Indeed, bring them on the Day of Judgment and requite the servant for them. Allah is the most subtle, whose knowledge encompasses all secret and hidden matters. He is kind to His servants and aware of everything."
"O my son, fulfil your moral obligations, bid what is known to be right and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience what befalls you. These are indeed acts of courage and resolve.",16,31,يَٰبُنَىَّ أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱنْهَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَصَابَكَ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلْأُمُورِ,"O my son! Establish the prayer by performing it to perfection; enjoin good and forbid evil, and bear patience upon whatever adversity you face in the process. Indeed, my instructions to you are from those that Allah has decided you should do, so you have no choice in doing or not doing them."
"Do not hold men in contempt, and do not walk with hauteur on the earth. Verily God does not like the proud and boastful.",17,31,وَلَا تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَمْشِ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ,"Do not turn your face away from the people in arrogance, and do not walk over the earth haughty and proud; indeed Allah does not love any of those who are haughty in their manner of walking, or arrogant in whatever blessings they are granted and ungrateful for. Rather, He hates them."
"Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's.""",18,31,وَٱقْصِدْ فِى مَشْيِكَ وَٱغْضُضْ مِن صَوْتِكَ إِنَّ أَنكَرَ ٱلْأَصْوَٰتِ لَصَوْتُ ٱلْحَمِيرِ,"Be moderate in your manner of walking: between hastiness and lethargy, displaying dignity. And lower your voice; do not raise it such that it causes inconvenience. Indeed, the most hideous of sounds is that of the donkey because of them being loud."
"Have you not seen that God has subjugated what is in the heavens and the earth to you, and bestowed His favours, external and esoteric, in abundance on you? And yet there are men who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or the Book enlightening.",19,31,أَلَمْ تَرَوْا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَأَسْبَغَ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعَمَهُۥ ظَٰهِرَةً وَبَاطِنَةً وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَٰدِلُ فِى ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلَا هُدًى وَلَا كِتَٰبٍ مُّنِيرٍ,"O People! Do you not see and witness that Allah has made it easy for you to take benefit from the whatever is in the heavens: the sun, moon and stars, and has also made it easy for you to take benefit from the livestock, trees and plants on earth? He has also perfected His blessings for you which are clear to the eyes: beautiful appearances and delightful scenes, and those that are hidden from sight i.e. intelligence and knowledge. Despite all these blessings, there are some people who dispute in the oneness of Allah without having any knowledge based on revelation from Allah or insightful intelligence, nor a clear book revealed from Allah."
"When you ask them to follow what God has revealed, they say: ""No. We shall follow what we found our ancestors following,"" even though the devil were calling them to the torment of Hell!",20,31,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوا۟ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ يَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"If it is said to these disputers regarding the oneness of Allah, “Follow the revelation Allah has revealed to His Messenger!” they say, “I will not follow it, rather, I will follow in the worship of idols that I found our forefathers doing.” Will they follow their forefathers even though Satan is the one calling them towards deviance by inviting them to worship idols, that will lead them to the punishment of a blazing fire on the Day of Judgement?"
"He who turns his face to God in submission and does good, holds fast to a handle that is strong; for the resultance of things rests with God.",21,31,وَمَن يُسْلِمْ وَجْهَهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْأُمُورِ,"Whoever turns to Allah sincerely devoting worship to Him and doing good deeds, he has held on to the firmest of things those who hope for salvation can hold on to. He will not fear whatever he has held on to being cut off. and to Allah alone return all affairs; He will requite each person as they deserve."
"So do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you. They will be brought back to Us, when We shall tell them what they used to do. Whatever is in their hearts is known to God.",22,31,وَمَن كَفَرَ فَلَا يَحْزُنكَ كُفْرُهُۥٓ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"O Messenger! Whoever disbelieves in Allah, let not their disbelief grieve you. To Me alone they will return on the Day of Judgement; I will inform them of the evils they committed in the world and requite them for them. Indeed, Allah knows what is in the hearts; nothing is hidden from Him."
"We let them enjoy themselves only for a while, then We shall drag them to a severe punishment.",23,31,نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلًا ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,"I will let them enjoy whatever delicacies I have given them in the world for a short while, then compel them to a severe punishment on the Day of Judgement: the punishment of the hellfire."
"If you ask them: ""Who created the heavens and the earth?"" They will surely answer: ""God."" Say: ""All praise be to God."" But most of them do not understand.",24,31,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger! If you ask these idolaters: “Who created the heavens and who created the earth?” they will say: “Allah created them.” Say to them: “All praise is for Allah who has made the evidence against you clear.” However, the majority of them do not know who deserves all praise, because of their ignorance."
"To God belongs what is in the heavens and the earth. Verily He is all-sufficient, worthy of praise.",25,31,لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"To Allah alone belongs everything that is in the heavens and the earth, in terms of being His creation, under His ownership and decree. Allah is self sufficient, not in need of his creation, praiseworthy in this world and the Hearafter."
"If all the trees of the earth were pens and the oceans ink, with many more oceans for replenishing them, the colloquy of God would never come to end. He is indeed all-mighty and all-wise.",26,31,وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَٰمٌ وَٱلْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَٰتُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"If all the trees on Earth were to be cut and made into pens, and the seas multiplied by seven and turned into ink, the Words of Allah would not finish due to their being infinite. Indeed, Allah is the Almighty whom none can overcome; the Wise in His creation and decree."
Your creation and resurrection is but like that of a single cell. Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing.,27,31,مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلَا بَعْثُكُمْ إِلَّا كَنَفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"O people! Your creation and your resurrection for accountability and requital on the Day of Judgement, is as easy as creating and resurrecting just one soul. Indeed, Allah hears everything, hearing one sound does not preoccupy Him from hearing another; He also sees everything, seeing one thing does not preoccupy Him from hearing another either. And likewise, creating something and resurrecting it does not preoccupy Him from creating and resurrecting another."
"Do you not see that God makes the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night? And He has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course. Surely God is aware of all you do.",28,31,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُولِجُ ٱلَّيْلَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِىٓ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"Do you not see that Allah shortens the night to lengthen the day, and shortens the day to lengthen the night? He also set the orbits of the sun and the moon, so each moves in its orbit for a fixed length of time. Do you also not see that Allah is aware of everything you do; none of your actions are hidden from Him, and He will requite you for them."
"That is so for God is the Reality, and what they invoke other than Him is illusion. Indeed God is all-high and supreme.",29,31,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ ٱلْبَٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"That organisation and decree bears testimony to Allah alone being true; He is true in His being, attributes and actions. It also bears testimony to everything that the idolaters worship being unfounded falsehood, and that Allah is the Exalted in His being and His attributes over all His creation; there is none higher than Him, and He is greater than everything."
"Do you not see that the ships sail in the ocean by the grace of God, that He may show you some of His glories. Verily there are signs in this for those who are constant and give thanks.",30,31,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ لِيُرِيَكُم مِّنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,"Do you not see that the ships sail the sea due to His kindness in facilitating for it, so that He can show you - O people - from His signs that prove His power, may He be glorified, and His kindness. Indeed, in that are proofs of His power for every person patient upon harms that afflict him; grateful for whatever blessings he receives."
"When the waves overshadow them like a canopy, they pray to God with all-exclusive faith in Him. But after He has safely brought them to the shore, there are some who vacillate between doubt and belief, but no one rejects Our signs except those who are perverse and disbelieve.",31,31,وَإِذَا غَشِيَهُم مَّوْجٌ كَٱلظُّلَلِ دَعَوُا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّىٰهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ فَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَّا كُلُّ خَتَّارٍ كَفُورٍ,"And when a mountain-like wave and dark clouds surround them from all sides, they call out to Allah sincerely supplicating and worshipping Him. Then, when Allah accepts their supplication and saves them from drowning, bringing them back to land, some of them are moderate in their praise, falling short of showing due gratitude to Him, while others reject the blessing of Allah; None reject My signs except every deceitful person, like the one that promised to be grateful if Allah saved him, then broke his promise. And none reject My signs except every ungrateful person who never shows gratitude for the favours Allah grants him."
"O people, fear your Lord and dread the day when no father will avail a son, nor son his father. Truly the promise of God is true. Do not be deluded by the life of this world, and do not let the deceiver draw you away from God.",32,31,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ وَٱخْشَوْا۟ يَوْمًا لَّا يَجْزِى وَالِدٌ عَن وَلَدِهِۦ وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ هُوَ جَازٍ عَن وَالِدِهِۦ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَلَا تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَا يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,"O people! Be mindful of your Lord by fulfilling His commands and refraining from His prohibitions, and fear His punishment on the day when no father will be able to benefit his child, nor a child benefit its father in the slightest. Indeed, the promise of Allah of requital on the Day of Judgment is true and will inevitably be fulfilled, so let not the worldly life and whatever desires and amusements it contains deceive you, nor let Satan deceive you by misunderstanding the forbearance of Allah and His delaying the punishment from you."
"Only God has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends rain from the heavens, and knows what is in the mothers' wombs. No one knows what he will do on the morrow; no one knows in what land he will die. Surely God knows and is cognisant.",33,31,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُۥ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ ٱلْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلْأَرْحَامِ وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَدًا وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌۢ بِأَىِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌۢ,"Indeed, Allah alone has knowledge of the Hour: He knows when it will occur; He sends the rain whenever He wishes and He knows what is in the wombs: whether it is male or female, successful or wretched. No soul knows what good or bad it will do the next day, nor does it know what land it will die in. Rather, Allah is the one who knows all of that, He is Knower and Aware of all that; nothing is hidden from Him."
ALIF LAM MIM.,0,32,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ الٓمٓ,Alif Lam Meem. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
The revelation of this Book free of doubt and involution is from the Lord of all the worlds.,1,32,تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"This Qur’ān that Muhammad (peace be upon him) has brought, was revealed to him by the Lord of all the worlds. There is no doubt in it."
"Or do they say he has fabricated it? In fact, it is the truth from your Lord so that you may warn the people to whom no admonisher was sent before you. They may haply come to guidance.",2,32,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ بَلْ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْمًا مَّآ أَتَىٰهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,"These disbelievers say, “Indeed, Muhammad has fabricated it and attributed it to his Lord.” It is not as they say, rather, it is the truth in which there is no doubt; revealed from your Lord - O Messenger - to you so that you may warn a nation to whom no Messenger has come before you, of the punishment of Allah, perhaps they are guided to the truth and they follow and practice it."
"It is God who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, in six spans, then assumed all authority. You have no protector other than Him, nor any intercessor. Will you not be warned even then?",3,32,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ مَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا شَفِيعٍ أَفَلَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"Allah is the one who created the heavens and the earth, and created everything in between them in six days, while He is capable of creating them in less than the time it takes to bat an eyelid. He then rose over His throne in a manner that befits His Majesty. O people! You do not have a guardian who takes care of your affairs other than Him, or an intercessor who intercedes for you in front of your Lord. Do you not think and worship Allah who created you, not worshipping others with Him?"
"He regulates all affairs from high to low, then they rise to perfection step by step in a (heavenly) day whose measure is a thousand years of your reckoning.",4,32,يُدَبِّرُ ٱلْأَمْرَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُۥٓ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ,"Allah organises the affairs of all creations in the heavens and the earth, then that affair ascends to Him in a day, the duration of which is a thousand years of your counting - O people - in the world."
"Such is (He) the knower of the unknown and the known, the mighty and the merciful,",5,32,ذَٰلِكَ عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"That being who organises all that is aware of everything that is present and absent, none of it is hidden from Him. He is the Almighty whom none can overcome; who takes retribution from his enemies and is the Merciful towards His believing servants."
"Who made all things He created excellent; and first fashioned man from clay,",6,32,ٱلَّذِىٓ أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُۥ وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنِ مِن طِينٍ,"He is the being who perfected everything He created, and created the human from clay, without there having been a previous example of him."
"Then made his offspring from the extract of base fluid,",7,32,ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُۥ مِن سُلَٰلَةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ مَّهِينٍ,He then created the human’s children after it from a delicate fluid: semen.
"Then proportioned and breathed into him of His spirit, and gave you the senses of hearing, sight and feeling. And yet how little are the thanks you offer!",8,32,ثُمَّ سَوَّىٰهُ وَنَفَخَ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِهِۦ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,"Then He completed the creation of the human in his complete form His soul through the angel appointed with blowing the soul, and made for you - O people - ears so that you could hear with them, eyes so that you could see, and hearts so that you could understand. Little are you grateful for these bounties of Allah which He bestows upon you."
"But they say: ""When we have mingled with the earth, shall we be created anew?"" In fact they deny the meeting with their Lord.",9,32,وَقَالُوٓا۟ أَءِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍۭ بَلْ هُم بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,"The idolaters who reject the resurrection say, “When we die, our bodies become dust and we become invisible in the earth, will we be resurrected alive again, anew? That cannot be understood.” Rather, in reality, they are rejecters of the resurrection and do not believe in it."
"Say: ""The angel of death appointed over you will take away your soul, then you will be sent back to your Lord.""",10,32,قُلْ يَتَوَفَّىٰكُم مَّلَكُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ٱلَّذِى وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject the resurrection: “The angel of death who Allah has appointed to seize your souls shall do so, then to Me alone you will return on the Day of Judgment to give account and to be requited."
"If only you could see when the sinners will stand before their Lord, heads hung low, (and say:) ""O Lord, we have seen and heard. So send us back. We shall do the right, for we have come to believe with certainty.""",11,32,وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذِ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُوا۟ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَٱرْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَٰلِحًا إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ,"The criminals will soon emerge on the Day of Judgment bowing their heads in humiliation due to their rejection of resurrection, feeling ashamed and saying, “Our Lord! I have seen the resurrection I used to reject, and heard the confirmation of that which the Messengers brought from You, so return us to the worldly life so that I can do good deeds that will make You pleased with us. Indeed, I now convinced of the resurrection and the truth of whatever the Messengers brought.” If you were to see the criminals in that state, you would see a grave scene!"
Had We intended We could have given every soul its guidance; but inevitable is My word that I will fill up Hell with men and jinns together.,12,32,وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَءَاتَيْنَا كُلَّ نَفْسٍ هُدَىٰهَا وَلَٰكِنْ حَقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ مِنِّى لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"And if I wished to give every soul guidance and ability, I would have forced them onto this, but through wisdom and justice it was necessary to pass the decree. that I would definitely fill hell on the Day of Judgment with the disbelievers from the Thaqalan: the jinns and the humans, because of their choosing the path of disbelief and error over the path of belief and steadfastness."
"So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you. Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.",13,32,فَذُوقُوا۟ بِمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَٰذَآ إِنَّا نَسِينَٰكُمْ وَذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And on the Day of Judgment it will be said to them in rebuke and censure, “Now taste the punishment due to your heedlesness of the meeting with Allah on the Day of Judgment for accountability in the worldly life, I shall leave you in the punishment without caring for how much you suffer from it. Taste the punishment of the everlasting hellfire that will not end, because of the sins you used to commit in the world."
"Only they believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded, bow in adoration, and give praise to their Lord, and do not become arrogant.",14,32,إِنَّمَا يُؤْمِنُ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُوا۟ بِهَا خَرُّوا۟ سُجَّدًا وَسَبَّحُوا۟ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"“Only those people believe in my verses revealed to My Messenger who, when they are reminded of them prostate to Allah glorifying Him together with praising Him. They are not arrogant from worshipping Him nor prostrating to Him in any condition.”"
"Their backs do not rest on their beds, and they pray to their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of what We have given them (in charity).",15,32,تَتَجَافَىٰ جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"They leave their beds to worship Allah, supplicating to Him in their prayers, fearing His punishment and hoping in His mercy. They also spend the wealth Allah has given them in His path."
No soul knows what peace and joy lie hidden from them as reward for what they have done.,16,32,فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"So no one knows what things Allah has prepared for it in terms of bringing coolness and joy to the eyes, as a reward for the good deeds it would do in the world. It is a reward that no one except Allah can comprehend, due to its greatness."
"Is one who is a believer like one who is a transgressor? No, they are not alike.",17,32,أَفَمَن كَانَ مُؤْمِنًا كَمَن كَانَ فَاسِقًا لَّا يَسْتَوُۥنَ,"The one who believes in Allah, acts upon His commands and refrains from that which he is prohibited from, is not like the one who disobeys Him. The two groups are not equal in terms of requital according to Allah."
"As for those who believe and do the right, there are gardens for abode as welcome for what they had done.",18,32,أَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَلَهُمْ جَنَّٰتُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ نُزُلًۢا بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"As for those who have faith in Allah and do good deeds, the reward prepared for them is gardens in which they shall remain as a mark of honour for them from Allah, a reward for the god deeds they used to do in the world."
"As for those who disobey, their abode is Hell. Whensoever they wish to escape from it they would be dragged back into it, and told: ""Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to call a lie.""",19,32,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُوا۟ فَمَأْوَىٰهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُوٓا۟ أَن يَخْرُجُوا۟ مِنْهَآ أُعِيدُوا۟ فِيهَا وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ ذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٱلَّذِى كُنتُم بِهِۦ تُكَذِّبُونَ,"As for those who left the obedience of Allah by disbelief and committing sins, the abode prepared for them on the Day of Judgment is the hellfire in which they shall remain forever. Every time they attempt to come out of it, they will be returned to it, and it will be said to them, rebuking them, “Taste the punishment of the hellfire you used to deny in the world, when My Messengers would warn you of it.”"
"But We shall make them taste the affliction of this world before the greater torment, so that they may retract.",20,32,وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْأَدْنَىٰ دُونَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"I will definitely make these disbelievers who left the obedience of their Lord and do not repent, suffer trials and afflictions in the worldly life, for perhaps due to those worldly afflictions, they will repent to Allah."
Who is more wicked than he who is reminded of his Lord's revelations yet turns away from them; We will surely requite the sinners.,21,32,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِۦ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَآ إِنَّا مِنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ,"There is no one more oppressive than the one who is admonished with the verses of Allah but does not take heed, but turns away without caring about them. Indeed, I will inevitably take retribution from the criminals, because of their committing disbelief and sins, and their turning away from the My verses."
Verily We gave Moses the Book; so be not in doubt about his having received it; and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel.,22,32,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ فَلَا تَكُن فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآئِهِۦ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"Verily, I gave Moses the Torah, so - O Messenger - do not be in doubt over you having met Moses in the Night Journey and the Ascension. I made the book revealed to Moses a guide for the Israelites from deviance."
When they persevered and firmly believed Our revelations We appointed learned men among them who guided them by Our command.,23,32,وَجَعَلْنَا مِنْهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا لَمَّا صَبَرُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يُوقِنُونَ,"And I made leaders from the Children of Israel whom the people would emulate and follow. They became guides to the truth when they were patient in calling others to Allah and fulfilling the commands of Allah and refraining from His prohibitions, and when they firmly believed in His Ayahs that were revealed to their Messengers."
"Surely your Lord will decide between them about what they were at variance, on the Day of Resurrection.",24,32,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord is the one who will judge between them on the Day of Judgment in matters they would dispute in the world; so He will make the one on truth clear from the one on falsehood, and requite each with what they deserve."
"Did they not find guidance in the many generations We had destroyed before them, over whose dwellings they (now) walk? There were indeed signs in this. Will they even then not listen?",25,32,أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَٰكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ أَفَلَا يَسْمَعُونَ,"Are these people blind that they cannot see how many of the previous nations I destroyed before them? Here they are, walking past dwellings which were previously resided in by those who were destroyed, yet they do not take heed from their state? Indeed, in the destruction of the previous nations due to their disbelief, are lessons from which the truth of their Messengers can be proven, who came to them from Allah. Will these rejecters of the verses of Allah then not listen attentively using their intellects?"
"Do they not see that We drive the rain towards a land that is dry, then grow grain from it which their cattle and they themselves eat? Will they not see even then?",26,32,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ ٱلْمَآءَ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِۦ زَرْعًا تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَٰمُهُمْ وَأَنفُسُهُمْ أَفَلَا يُبْصِرُونَ,"Do these rejecters of resurrection not see that I send rainwater to a barren land in which there are no plants, and then take out the crops by rain water, from which their cattle eat as well as themselves? Do they not see that and understand that whoever causes the barren earth to grow, is capable of reviving the dead?"
"Yet they say: ""When will this decree come, if you speak the truth?""",27,32,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْفَتْحُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Those that reject the resurrection say, while seeking the punishment in haste, “When is this judgement that you claim is going to be made between us and yourselves on the Day of Judgement, and consequently our abode will be hellfire and yours paradise?”"
"Say: ""Of no use will be the acceptance of belief to unbelievers on the Day of Decision, nor will they be granted respite.",28,32,قُلْ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَتْحِ لَا يَنفَعُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِيمَٰنُهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to them: “O Messenger say to them: the day of the judgement, when it comes, will be too late to believe for those who denied the truth in the world. Nor will they be given respite to make repentance.”"
Therefore turn away from them and wait as they are waiting.,29,32,فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَٱنتَظِرْ إِنَّهُم مُّنتَظِرُونَ,"O Messenger! So turn away from these people after they have persisted in their deviance, and wait for the punishment of Allah to befall them. Indeed, they wait for an unpredictable turn of fortune against you, but in reality they only await their destruction."
O PROPHET FEAR God and do not follow the unbelievers and the hypocrites.,0,33,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ وَلَا تُطِعِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"O Prophet, remain firm, you and those with you, on being Mindful, through carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions, and fear Him alone. And do not obey the disbelievers and hypocrites in what they desire. Allah is Knowing of the plans the disbelievers and hypocrites make, and Wise in His creating and managing."
Follow what is revealed to you by your Lord. Verily God is all-knowing and all-wise.,1,33,وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا,"And follow the revelation your Lord reveals to you. Allah is Aware of what you do. None of that escapes Him, and He shall reward you for your actions."
Trust in God. God is sufficient as guardian.,2,33,وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا,And rely on Allah alone in all your affairs. And He is sufficient as a protector for those of His servants who trust in Him.
"God has not provided two hearts in the breast of a man, nor made your wives, whom you pronounce ""mothers"" (in order to divorce them), your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only what your lips pronounce. God says what is just, and shows the right way.",3,33,مَّا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِى جَوْفِهِۦ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَٰجَكُمُ ٱلَّٰٓـِٔى تُظَٰهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَآءَكُمْ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُم بِأَفْوَٰهِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَقُولُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِى ٱلسَّبِيلَ,"Just as Allah has not placed two hearts in the chest of any man, as some of them believe, likewise He did not make wives like mothers with respect to being forbidden to marry, and likewise He did not make claimed sons like biological sons, because thihar which is for a man to make his wife unlawful for himself, and likewise, claiming the children of others as one’s own are practices of ignorance which Islam has nullified. That making unlawful through thihar and taking as sons those whose fathers you are not is a statement you repeat with your mouths, which has no reality. The wife is not a mother nor is the claimed son rightfully for the claimant. And Allah says the truth so that His servants practice it, and He guides towards the path of truth."
"Call them by the names of their fathers. This is the right course in the sight of God. If you do not know their fathers, they are then your brothers in religion and your friends. It will not be a sin if you make a mistake, unless you do so intentionally; for God is forgiving and kind.",4,33,ٱدْعُوهُمْ لِءَابَآئِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوٓا۟ ءَابَآءَهُمْ فَإِخْوَٰنُكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَمَوَٰلِيكُمْ وَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَآ أَخْطَأْتُم بِهِۦ وَلَٰكِن مَّا تَعَمَّدَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"Attribute those you claim to be your sons towards their real fathers, because attributing them towards them is justice in the eyes of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers to whom you can attribute them, then they are your brothers in religion and the sons of your uncles, so call them by: “O brother” or “O cousin”. And there is no sin on you if one of you makes a mistake and attributes a claimed son towards his claimant, but you will be sinful if you intentionally say that. And Allah is Forgiving to those of His servants who repent, Merciful to them as He did not punish them due to mistakes."
"The Prophet is closer to the faithful than they are themselves; and his wives are as their mothers. Yet blood relations are closer to one another according to God's decree, more than (other) believers and the emigrants (who left their homes in the cause of God), but you should be kind to your friends. This is inscribed in the Book (of decrees).",5,33,ٱلنَّبِىُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَأَزْوَٰجُهُۥٓ أُمَّهَٰتُهُمْ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ إِلَّآ أَن تَفْعَلُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَوْلِيَآئِكُم مَّعْرُوفًا كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا,"The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has more right over the believers than their own selves in whatever he calls them to, even if they incline towards something else. And his wives are like mothers for all believers, hence it is unlawful for any believer to marry any of them after he passes away. Relatives are more deserving of one another in inheritance by Allah’s decree than the believers and those who migrated for Allah's cause, who would previously inherit by means of contractual agreement between themselves in the beginning of Islam. Then Allah abrogated their inheriting from one another after that. Except if you, O believers, do good towards your close associates besides the inheritors, by making a bequest for them and being kind to them, then that is your right. That is a decree inscribed in the Preserved Tablet."
"When We made the covenant with the prophets, and with you, as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,",6,33,وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ مِيثَٰقَهُمْ وَمِنكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُم مِّيثَٰقًا غَلِيظًا,"O Messenger, remember when I took a firm covenant from the prophets that they will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him, and that they will convey the revelation sent to them. And I have taken it especially from you, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus son of Mary. I have taken a firm covenant from them to fulfil the conveying of Allah’s messages they have been entrusted with."
"(It was) so that God may ask the truthful of their sincerity. As for the infidels, He has prepared a painful punishment for them.",7,33,لِّيَسْـَٔلَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ عَن صِدْقِهِمْ وَأَعَدَّ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"Allah took this firm covenant from the prophets so He can ask the truthful Messengers regarding their truthfulness, to silence the disbelievers, and Allah has prepared for those who disbelieve in Him and His Messengers a painful punishment on the Day of Judgment, and it is the fire of hell."
"O you who believe, remember the favours of God to you when an army came against you and We sent a wind against them and forces that you did not see. But God sees all that you do.",8,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَآءَتْكُمْ جُنُودٌ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحًا وَجُنُودًا لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and practice what He has legislated, remember Allah’s favour on you when the armies of the disbelievers came to Madina, prepared to fight you, and the hypocrites and Jews supported them. Then I sent upon them the eastern winds through which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was helped, and I sent armies of angels you did not see. Then the disbelievers turned away fleeing, not being able to do anything. And Allah is Seeing what you do. None of that is hidden from Him and He shall reward you for that."
"When they came upon you from above and below you, when the eyes were stupefied with horror, and hearts jumped to the throats, and you made wild suppositions about God.",9,33,إِذْ جَآءُوكُم مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ وَإِذْ زَاغَتِ ٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ وَبَلَغَتِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٱلْحَنَاجِرَ وَتَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلظُّنُونَا۠,"And that was when the disbelievers came to you from the top of the valley and from the bottom, from the East and West, when the eyes turned away from everything besides seeing the enemy and the hearts reached the throats due to intense fear. And you were thinking different thoughts regarding Allah. At times you were thinking of help and at time you were thinking of losing hope from Him."
"The faithful were sorely tried there and were shaken completely,",10,33,هُنَالِكَ ٱبْتُلِىَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُوا۟ زِلْزَالًا شَدِيدًا,"In that position in the Battle of the Trench, the believers were tested through the enemies."
"When the hypocrites and those who were filled with doubt, said: ""The promise of God and His Apostle was nothing but deceit.""",11,33,وَإِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ مَّا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥٓ إِلَّا غُرُورًا,"On that day, the hypocrites and those of weak faith, whose hearts contain doubts said: “The promise of Allah and his messenger for victory and being established on this land is false and baseless.”"
"When a section of them said: ""O people of Yathrib, there is no place for you here, turn back;"" and a section of them asked leave of the Prophet, saying: ""Our homes lie exposed,"" -- while they were not exposed. Their only intention was to run away.",12,33,وَإِذْ قَالَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَٰٓأَهْلَ يَثْرِبَ لَا مُقَامَ لَكُمْ فَٱرْجِعُوا۟ وَيَسْتَـْٔذِنُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمُ ٱلنَّبِىَّ يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا عَوْرَةٌ وَمَا هِىَ بِعَوْرَةٍ إِن يُرِيدُونَ إِلَّا فِرَارًا,"O Messenger, remember when a group of hypocrites said to the people of Madina: “O people of Yathrib (the name for Madina before Islam), there is no stability for you by the peak of Silah near the trench, so return to your homes”. And a group of them was seeking permission from the Prophet (peace be upon him) to return to their homes, claiming that their homes were exposed to the enemy, but they were not exposed as they claimed. They were only seeking to flee from their enemy through this false excuse."
"If the (enemy) had entered the city from every side and asked them to rise in revolt, they would have done so, and not hesitated but a little;",13,33,وَلَوْ دُخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَقْطَارِهَا ثُمَّ سُئِلُوا۟ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ لَءَاتَوْهَا وَمَا تَلَبَّثُوا۟ بِهَآ إِلَّا يَسِيرًا,"And if the enemy were to enter upon them in Madina from all its sides and ask them to return to disbelieving and associating partners with Allah, they would grant their enemy this, and they would not lag behind from becoming renegade and turning back towards disbelief except a little."
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.,14,33,وَلَقَدْ كَانُوا۟ عَٰهَدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن قَبْلُ لَا يُوَلُّونَ ٱلْأَدْبَٰرَ وَكَانَ عَهْدُ ٱللَّهِ مَسْـُٔولًا,"And these hypocrites had promised Allah after they fled from fighting on the occasion of Uhud that if Allah were to make them witness another battle, they will definitely fight their enemy and not flee out of fear. However, they broke their promise. And the servant is responsible for the promise he made to Allah and he will soon be questioned about it."
"Say: ""Of no gain will be your running away if you run from death or being killed, even then you will enjoy the good things of life but only for a while.""",15,33,قُل لَّن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلْفِرَارُ إِن فَرَرْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ أَوِ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَإِذًا لَّا تُمَتَّعُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"O Messenger, say to these people: “Fleeing will never benefit you if you flee from fighting, out of fear of death or being killed, because the appointed times are fixed, and fighting do not bring them closer nor does fleeing distance them. And if you do flee and your time has not come, you will not be able to enjoy life except for a short while”."
"Say: ""Who will save you from God if He decide to afflict you or show you His mercy?"" They will never find a friend or helper apart from God.",16,33,قُلْ مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَعْصِمُكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ سُوٓءًا أَوْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ رَحْمَةً وَلَا يَجِدُونَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"O Messenger, say to them: “Who can save you from Allah if He intends for you the death or being killed you dislike, or He intends for you the safety and good you hope for? There is nobody to save you from that”. And these hypocrites will not find for themselves any associate besides Allah to take care of their affairs, nor any helper to save them from Allah punishing them."
"Surely God knows who among you obstruct, and those who say to their brethren: ""Come to us,"" and go to battle but seldom,",17,33,قَدْ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُعَوِّقِينَ مِنكُمْ وَٱلْقَآئِلِينَ لِإِخْوَٰنِهِمْ هَلُمَّ إِلَيْنَا وَلَا يَأْتُونَ ٱلْبَأْسَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Allah knows those of you who hold others back from fighting alongside Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and those who say to their brothers: “Come to us and do not fight alongside him, lest you get killed, because we fear you will get killed”. And these forsaken people do not come to battle or participate in it except rarely, to remove blame from themselves, not to help Allah and His Messenger."
"Being chary of helping you. But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man's in the swoon of death. Yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues, covetous of the best (of booty). Such as these have not come to belief. So God nullifies whatever they have done. This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.",18,33,أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ فَإِذَا جَآءَ ٱلْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدُورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَٱلَّذِى يُغْشَىٰ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ ٱلْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ أَشِحَّةً عَلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا۟ فَأَحْبَطَ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرًا,"O group of believers, they are miserly with you with their wealth, so they do not help you by spending it; miserly with their souls, so they do not fight alongside you; and miserly with their love, so they do not love you. Then when fear at the time of meeting the enemy comes, you will see them looking at you, O Messenger, with their eyes rolling out of cowardice, just as the eyes of a person who is suffering the pangs of death roll. But when fear leaves them and they become content, they harm you verbally with abusive sharp tongues. They are greedy for booty which they look for. Those who have been described with these qualities have not truly believed, so Allah cancelled the reward of their actions. And this cancelling was easy for Allah."
They think the allied tribes have not withdrawn; and if the allied tribes had advanced they would have wished that they were rather with the Arabs of the desert asking news of you; and had they been among you they would have fought but just a little.,19,33,يَحْسَبُونَ ٱلْأَحْزَابَ لَمْ يَذْهَبُوا۟ وَإِن يَأْتِ ٱلْأَحْزَابُ يَوَدُّوا۟ لَوْ أَنَّهُم بَادُونَ فِى ٱلْأَعْرَابِ يَسْـَٔلُونَ عَنْ أَنۢبَآئِكُمْ وَلَوْ كَانُوا۟ فِيكُم مَّا قَٰتَلُوٓا۟ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"These cowards think the coalition conspiring to fight Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and fight the believers will never leave until they totally destroy the believers. And if it is decreed that the coalition come another time, these cowardly hypocrites will wish they were not in Madina, but rather they were with the bedouins far from it, asking regarding your news: what happened to you after your enemies fought you? And even if they were amongst you, O believers, they would not have fought alongside you except a little, so do not pay attention to them or be sad over them."
"You have indeed a noble paradigm in the Apostle of God for him who fears God and the Day of Resurrection, and remembers God frequently.",20,33,لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِى رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلْءَاخِرَ وَذَكَرَ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرًا,"There has been for you an excellent example in what Allah’s Messenger said, carried out and practiced, for he presented his own noble self and personally engaged in battle, so how after that can you be miserly with your souls over his soul? And only he who is hopeful of the Last Day, works for it and remembers Allah abundantly will follow Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him). As for the one who is not hopeful of the Last Day and does not remember Allah abundantly, he does not follow His Messenger (peace be upon him)."
"When the faithful saw (the armies of) the allied tribes, they said: ""This is what God and His Apostle had promised us; and God and His Apostle say the truth;"" and this enhanced their faith and obedience.",21,33,وَلَمَّا رَءَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْأَحْزَابَ قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَصَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّآ إِيمَٰنًا وَتَسْلِيمًا,"When the believers saw the companies which had gathered to fight them, they said: “This is the test, tribulation and help Allah and His Messenger promised us, and Allah and His Messenger were true in this, for it has occurred”. And seeing the companies did not increase them except in faith and submission to Him."
"There are men among the faithful who have been true to the covenant they had made with God; and some of them fulfilled their vows (by dying in His cause), and some still wait (prepared for death), and stand firm,",22,33,مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا۟ مَا عَٰهَدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَىٰ نَحْبَهُۥ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا۟ تَبْدِيلًا,"Amongst the believers are men who were true to Allah, so they fulfilled what they promised Him, namely firmness and patience on striving in Allah’s way. Amongst them are those who died or were killed in Allah’s way and amongst them are those who await martyrdom in His way. And these believers did not change what they promised Allah like the hypocrites did with their promises."
"That God may recompense the truthful for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites or relent towards them, as He will. God is surely forgiving and kind.",23,33,لِّيَجْزِىَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ بِصِدْقِهِمْ وَيُعَذِّبَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ إِن شَآءَ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"So that Allah rewards the truthful who fulfilled what they promised Allah, by virtue of their truth and fulfilling their promises, and punish the hypocrites who broke their promises if He wishes, by making them die before they repent from their disbelief, or by accepting their repentance by enabling them to repent. And Allah is Forgiving to one who repents for his sins and Merciful to him."
"God drove the unbelievers back in their fury, and they gained no advantage. God was sufficient (to help) the believers in the battle. God is all-powerful and all-mighty.",24,33,وَرَدَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِغَيْظِهِمْ لَمْ يَنَالُوا۟ خَيْرًا وَكَفَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلْقِتَالَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ قَوِيًّا عَزِيزًا,"And Allah repelled the disbelieving groups who were conspiring to fight the believers and they were not successful in totally destroying the believers as they intended, losers who were angry due to their returning in failure. And Allah sufficed the believers in fighting them, by the winds He sent and the angels He sent down. And Allah is Powerful and Mighty; nobody attempts to overpower Allah except that He will be left defeated and deserted."
"He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;",25,33,وَأَنزَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَٰهَرُوهُم مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِن صَيَاصِيهِمْ وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعْبَ فَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ وَتَأْسِرُونَ فَرِيقًا,"And Allah brought the Jews who helped them down from their fortresses in which they would protect themselves from their enemy, and Allah put fear into their hearts. A group of them you kill, O believers, and a group of them you take as captives."
"And He made you inherit their lands and mansions and wealth, and a country you had not traversed before, for God has power over everything.",26,33,وَأَوْرَثَكُمْ أَرْضَهُمْ وَدِيَٰرَهُمْ وَأَمْوَٰلَهُمْ وَأَرْضًا لَّمْ تَطَـُٔوهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرًا,"And Allah made you owners of their land, along with the crops and date trees they contained, after destroying them, and He made you owners of their homes and other wealth, and He made you owners of the land of Khaybar which you have not yet trodden, but you will soon tread on it. This is a promise and good news for the believers. And Allah is Powerful over everything; Nothing is outside His ability."
"O Prophet, say to your wives: ""In case you desire the life and pomp of this world, come, I will provide you handsomely, and let you go with a grace.",27,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَٰجِكَ إِن كُنتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا فَتَعَالَيْنَ أُمَتِّعْكُنَّ وَأُسَرِّحْكُنَّ سَرَاحًا جَمِيلًا,"O Prophet, say to your wives if they seek an increase in spending but you did not have anything more to spend on them: “If you seek the worldly life and the adornment it contains, then let me give you the provisions given to a divorced women, and I will let you go in the best of manners without causing harm.”"
"But if you desire God, His Apostle, and the joys of life to come, then God has verily set apart for those of you who are good, a great reward.""",28,33,وَإِن كُنتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَٱلدَّارَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْمُحْسِنَٰتِ مِنكُنَّ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"But if you desire the pleasure of Allah and the pleasure of His Messenger, and you seek paradise in the abode of the afterlife, remain patient on your condition, for Allah has prepared a great reward for those of you who do good through patience and good companionship”."
"O wives of the Prophet, whosoever of you commits an act of clear shamelessness, her punishment will be doubled. This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.",29,33,يَٰنِسَآءَ ٱلنَّبِىِّ مَن يَأْتِ مِنكُنَّ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ يُضَٰعَفْ لَهَا ٱلْعَذَابُ ضِعْفَيْنِ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرًا,"O wives of the Prophet, whoever amongst you comes with an open sin, her punishment will be doubled on the Day of Judgment, due to her status and rank, and to protect the personage of the Prophet (peace be upon him). And this doubling is easy for Allah."
"But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Apostle, and does the right, will be given a two-fold reward by Us; and We have a rich provision in readiness for her.",30,33,وَمَن يَقْنُتْ مِنكُنَّ لِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَتَعْمَلْ صَٰلِحًا نُّؤْتِهَآ أَجْرَهَا مَرَّتَيْنِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهَا رِزْقًا كَرِيمًا,"Whoever from among you obeys Allah and His Messenger, and does good deeds which are pleasing to Allah, Allah will grant her double the reward all other women get, and will prepare for her a noble reward in the Hereafter, which is Paradise."
"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like other women. If you are mindful of God, do not be too obliging in your speech, lest some one sick of heart should covet your person; so say only customary things.",31,33,يَٰنِسَآءَ ٱلنَّبِىِّ لَسْتُنَّ كَأَحَدٍ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِنِ ٱتَّقَيْتُنَّ فَلَا تَخْضَعْنَ بِٱلْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ ٱلَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِۦ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا,"O the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him), You are not like other women in terms of privilege and nobility; you are on a level of privilege and nobility other women can never reach even if they were to fulfil the commands of Allah and refrain from things He has not allowed. Therefore, do not soften your tone when you speak to unrelated men, in case those with the disease of hypocrisy or impermissible desires begin to lust. Rather, speak in a manner well clear of any doubt, by speaking in a serious and not trivial tone as necessary."
"Stay at home, and do not deck yourselves with ostentation as in the days of paganism; fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God desires to remove impurities from you, O inmates of this house, and to cleanse and bring out the best in you.",32,33,وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ ٱلْأُولَىٰ وَأَقِمْنَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتِينَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَأَطِعْنَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ ٱلرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا,"And remain within your homes; do not leave them unless for a need; do not expose your beauty like the women who would do so before Islam to attract men; perform prayer to perfection; give Zakat of your wealth, and obey Allah and His Messenger. O wives of the Messenger of Allah and people of His household! Allah (may He be glorified) only intends to remove harm from you, and wants to purify your souls by adorning them with excellent characteristics such that no blemish remains."
"Remember God's revelations and the wisdom that are recited in your homes. God is indeed all perceiving, well-informed.",33,33,وَٱذْكُرْنَ مَا يُتْلَىٰ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْحِكْمَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفًا خَبِيرًا,"And mention whatever verses of Allah are revealed to His Messenger in your homes, and the pure ways of Allah’s Messenger that you observe. Indeed, Allah is kind to you by favouring you with putting you in the house of His Prophet; He knows you well because He chose you as wives for His Messenger and as mothers of all the believers from his people."
"Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women, men and women with endurance, men and women who are modest, men and women who give alms, men and women who observe fasting, men and women who guard their private parts, and those men and women who remember God a great deal, for them God has forgiveness and a great reward.",34,33,إِنَّ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَٱلْمُسْلِمَٰتِ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱلْقَٰنِتِينَ وَٱلْقَٰنِتَٰتِ وَٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ وَٱلصَّٰدِقَٰتِ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ وَٱلصَّٰبِرَٰتِ وَٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ وَٱلْخَٰشِعَٰتِ وَٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُتَصَدِّقَٰتِ وَٱلصَّٰٓئِمِينَ وَٱلصَّٰٓئِمَٰتِ وَٱلْحَٰفِظِينَ فُرُوجَهُمْ وَٱلْحَٰفِظَٰتِ وَٱلذَّٰكِرِينَ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَٱلذَّٰكِرَٰتِ أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"Indeed, the males who submit to Allah and the females who submit; the male believers in Allah and the female believers; the males who obey Allah and the females who obey; the males who are truthful in their belief and their statements and the females who are truthful; the males who are patient in obedience, in refraining from sins and during trials and the females who are patient; the males who give in obligatory and optional charity from their wealth and the females who give in charity; the males who keep obligatory and optional fasts and the females who fast; the males who guard their private parts from exposure to those who are forbidden from seeing them and from the immorality of fornication and anything leading to it, and the females who guard their private parts; and the males who remember Allah abundantly in private and in public and the females who remember Allah, Allah has prepared His special forgiveness for them from their sins, and an immense reward on the Day of Judgement which is Paradise."
No believing men and women have any choice in a matter after God and His Apostle have decided it. Whoever disobeys God and His Apostle has clearly lost the way and gone astray.,35,33,وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥٓ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلًا مُّبِينًا,It is not correct for a believing man or woman when Allah and His Messenger decide a matter for them that they have a choice in accepting or rejecting it. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly deviated from the straight path.
"When you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: ""Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,"" you were hiding something God was about to bring to light, for you had fear of men, though you should fear God more. And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them. God's command is to be fulfilled.",36,33,وَإِذْ تَقُولُ لِلَّذِىٓ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ زَوْجَكَ وَٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ وَتُخْفِى فِى نَفْسِكَ مَا ٱللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى ٱلنَّاسَ وَٱللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَىٰهُ فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ زَيْدٌ مِّنْهَا وَطَرًا زَوَّجْنَٰكَهَا لِكَىْ لَا يَكُونَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِىٓ أَزْوَٰجِ أَدْعِيَآئِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْا۟ مِنْهُنَّ وَطَرًا وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ مَفْعُولًا,"O Messenger! When you said to the one whom Allah had blessed with the bounty of Islam, and you had favoured with freeing him - the person intended here is Zayd bin Ḥārithah may Allah be pleased with him - when he came to you seeking counsel in divorcing his wife Zaynab bint Jaḥsh, you said to him, “Keep your wife; do not divorce her, and be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed” whilst, O Messenger, you were hiding within your heart that which Allah was going to expose: that Zayd should divorce her and He would command you to marry her. You were fearing the people and did not express that which you knew, when Allah is more deserving of your fear than the people. So when Zayd disinclined from her, and was happy at heart with divorcing her, he divorced her and I married you to her, so that there would be no sin on the believers if they were to marry the wives of their adopted sons after they had divorced them. Allah’s command will always come to pass, nothing can stop or obstruct it."
"There is no constraint on the Prophet in what God has decreed for him. This has been the way of God with (apostles) who have gone before you, and God's command is a determined act.",37,33,مَّا كَانَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ مِنْ حَرَجٍ فِيمَا فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قَدَرًا مَّقْدُورًا,"There is no sin or oppression on the Prophet (peace be upon him) in his marriage to the wife of his adopted son which Allah made permissible for him. In fact, in doing so, he is following in the way of the Prophets before him; he is not any different to the messengers in that regard. The Prophet had no choice in the completion of this marriage and nullifying of adoption that Allah decreed; it was a decree which was to pass, there was no one who could overturn it."
"(For) those who convey the messages of God, and fear Him and no one else, God is sufficient to keep account.",38,33,ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَٰلَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَخْشَوْنَهُۥ وَلَا يَخْشَوْنَ أَحَدًا إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيبًا,"These Prophets who convey the messages of Allah that are revealed to them to their nations, and do not fear anyone except Allah (may He be glorified), they do not pay attention to what others say when they do whatever Allah has permitted for them. Allah is sufficient as a guardian for the actions of His servants so that He may take them to account over them and requite them; if they are good then with good, if evil then with punishment."
"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but a messenger of God, and the seal of the prophets. God has knowledge of everything.",39,33,مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَآ أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن رَّسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ ٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, so he is not the father of Zayd, therefore his marrying his wife is not impermissible for him when Zayd divorces her. However, he is the Messenger of Allah sent to the people and the seal of the prophets: there is no prophet to come after him. Allah is the knower of everything, nothing is hidden from Him from the affairs of His servants."
"O you who believe, remember God a great deal,",40,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ذِكْرًا كَثِيرًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever He has legislated for them! Remember Allah abundantly with your hearts, tongues and limbs."
And sing His praises morning and evening.,41,33,وَسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا,"And exalt Him by glorifying Him (saying Subḥānallah) and proclaiming His oneness (Lā ilāha illallāh) at the start and the end the day, because of their virtue and the ease in remembering Allah through them."
"It is He who sends His blessings on you, as (do) His angels, that He may lead you out of darkness into light, for He is benevolent to the believers.",42,33,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُصَلِّى عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَلَٰٓئِكَتُهُۥ لِيُخْرِجَكُم مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَكَانَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيمًا,"He is the one who showers mercy upon you and praises you, and His angels pray for you that He removes you from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith. And Allah is merciful to the believers, so He does not punish them when they obey Him by fulfilling His command and refrain from what He has prohibited."
"Their greeting on the day they meet Him will be: ""Peace;"" and He has a generous reward ready for them.",43,33,تَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُۥ سَلَٰمٌ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا كَرِيمًا,"The greeting of the believers on the day they meet their Lord will be one of peace and security from all evil, And Allah has already prepared for them a generous reward, Paradise as a recompense for them obeying His commandments and staying away from His prohibitions."
"O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness and a bearer of happy tidings and an admonisher,",44,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ شَٰهِدًا وَمُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا,"O Prophet! Indeed, I have sent you to the people as a witness against them that you convey to them the message; as a giver of glad tidings to the believers of the Paradise I have prepared for them, and as a warner for the disbelievers of the punishment I have prepared for them."
"And to call (men) to God by His leave, and as a lamp resplendent.",45,33,وَدَاعِيًا إِلَى ٱللَّهِ بِإِذْنِهِۦ وَسِرَاجًا مُّنِيرًا,And I have sent you as a caller to the sole worship and obedience of Allah. and towards obedience to His command. I have also sent you as an illuminating lantern from which every person seeking guidance can take light.
Give glad tidings to the believers that there is great bounty for them from God.,46,33,وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ فَضْلًا كَبِيرًا,"And inform the believers in Allah who do whatever Allah legislated for them, of something that will please them: that they will have a great privilege from Allah (may He be glorified), which includes Allah helping them in the world and them succeeding in the Hereafter by entering Paradise."
"Do not listen to the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Ignore what they do to hurt you, and put your trust in God. God is sufficient as protector.",47,33,وَلَا تُطِعِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَدَعْ أَذَىٰهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا,"And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites in their call to preventing people from the religion of Allah, and turn away from them; perhaps that will be more effective in them believing in what you have brought to them. And rely on Allah in all your matters, of which is His helping you against your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a guardian the servants can rely upon in all their affairs in the world and the Hereafter."
"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.",48,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا فَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ وَسَرِّحُوهُنَّ سَرَاحًا جَمِيلًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever Allah has legislated for them! When you tie the knot of marriage with believing women, and then you divorce them before consummating the marriage with them, they are not required to go through the waiting period for you, regardless of whether it is through menstrual cycles or by counting months. This is because their wombs being free is known due to you having not consummated marriage with them. Also, give them some compensation according to your financial situations to console their broken emotions as a result of divorce, and clear the way for them to return to their families without causing them any inconvenience."
"We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God-given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father's brothers and daughters of your father's sisters, and daughters of your mother's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a privilege only for you and not the other believers. We know what We have ordained for them about their wives and maids they possess, so that you may be free of blame, for God is forgiving and kind.",49,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِنَّآ أَحْلَلْنَا لَكَ أَزْوَٰجَكَ ٱلَّٰتِىٓ ءَاتَيْتَ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ يَمِينُكَ مِمَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمِّكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمَّٰتِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَالِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَٰلَٰتِكَ ٱلَّٰتِى هَاجَرْنَ مَعَكَ وَٱمْرَأَةً مُّؤْمِنَةً إِن وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِىِّ إِنْ أَرَادَ ٱلنَّبِىُّ أَن يَسْتَنكِحَهَا خَالِصَةً لَّكَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا فَرَضْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِىٓ أَزْوَٰجِهِمْ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ لِكَيْلَا يَكُونَ عَلَيْكَ حَرَجٌ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"O Prophet! I have made permissible for you those of your wives whom you have given their dowry to, and those female servants that you possess from the captives Allah has given to you as booty. I have also made permissible for you, marriage to the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated with you. I have also made permissible for you to marry the believing woman who presents herself to you for marriage without any dowry. The permissibility of this type of marriage, without a dowry, is exclusive to the prophet (peace be upon him), and is not permissible to anyone else from his Nation. Verily, I know what I have made obligatory upon the believers with regards to their wives: it is not permissible for them to marry more than four women at once. I am also aware of legislating for them with regards to their female servants: that they can make use of however many they want without any restriction on number. And I have also permitted for you from the aforementioned that which I have not made permissible for others, so that there is no difficulty or difficulty upon you. Allah Forgiving to those of His servants who repent, and is merciful to them."
"You may defer the turn of any of your wives you like, and may take any other you desire. There is no harm if you take any of those (whose turn) you had deferred. This would be better as it would gladden their hearts and they will not grieve, and each will be happy with what you have given her. God knows what is in your heart, for He is all-wise and benign.",50,33,تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ وَتُـْٔوِىٓ إِلَيْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَيْتَ مِمَّنْ عَزَلْتَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكَ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَن تَقَرَّ أَعْيُنُهُنَّ وَلَا يَحْزَنَّ وَيَرْضَيْنَ بِمَآ ءَاتَيْتَهُنَّ كُلُّهُنَّ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَلِيمًا,"O Messenger! Defer the turn of whichever of your wives you wish to defer by not spending the night with her when it is her turn that you do, and spend the night with whichever of your wives you wish. And there is no sin on you should you wish to spend the night with the one whose turn you deferred. This choice and broadening your options for you is more effective in making you the coolness of the eyes of your wives and in them being pleased with whatever you give all of them, because they know that you have not left out an obligation or have not fulfilled a right. O Men! Allah knows the inclination of your hearts towards some of your wives over others; Allah is the knower of the actions of His servants, nothing from them is hidden from Him. He is also forbearing; He does not punish them immediately in case they repent to Him."
"No other women are lawful for you after this except those you have married, nor to change your present wives for other women even though their beauty should appeal to you. God is watchful of everything.",51,33,لَّا يَحِلُّ لَكَ ٱلنِّسَآءُ مِنۢ بَعْدُ وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ حُسْنُهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا مَلَكَتْ يَمِينُكَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ رَّقِيبًا,"O Messenger! It is not permissible for you to marry women other than your wives who are already in your protection, neither is it permissible for you to divorce them, or divorce any one of them so that you may marry another woman, even if her beauty appeals to you. However, it is permissible for you to take captive women into your possession. And Allah is a guardian over everything. This ruling proves the virtue of the mothers of the believers, because the Prophet peace be upon him was prohibited from divorcing them and marrying others whilst he was married to them."
"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten, and do not stay on talking. This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God.",52,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَدْخُلُوا۟ بُيُوتَ ٱلنَّبِىِّ إِلَّآ أَن يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَٰظِرِينَ إِنَىٰهُ وَلَٰكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَٱدْخُلُوا۟ فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَٱنتَشِرُوا۟ وَلَا مُسْتَـْٔنِسِينَ لِحَدِيثٍ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكُمْ كَانَ يُؤْذِى ٱلنَّبِىَّ فَيَسْتَحْىِۦ مِنكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَسْتَحْىِۦ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَٰعًا فَسْـَٔلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُؤْذُوا۟ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَآ أَن تَنكِحُوٓا۟ أَزْوَٰجَهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦٓ أَبَدًا إِنَّ ذَٰلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَظِيمًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever Allah has legislated for them! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet except after he has given you permission to enter by inviting you for food. And do not come too early so you end up sitting for longer than needed, waiting for the food to be cooked, rather when you are invited, then enter and after you have eaten, return. Do not remain behind socialising with each other, because remaining behind causes inconvenience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he feels embarrassed to ask you to leave, but Allah is not embarrassed to command you to do what is right, and so he has commanded you leave so that you do not cause inconvenience to him (peace be upon him) by staying for too long. And when you ask for something from the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) i.e. utensils etc. then ask from behind a veil, not face to face, in a manner that you cannot see them with your eyes. This is to protect them due to the stature of the Messenger of Allah. Asking from behind a veil is purer for your hearts and their hearts, so that Satan cannot influence your hearts through whispers and beautifying evil. And O believers! It is not befitting for you to cause inconvenience to the Messenger of Allah by remaining behind to socialise, nor that you marry his wives after he has passed away, because they are the wives of the believers and it is not permissible for anyone to marry his mother. Indeed, that causing inconvenience - of which is your marrying his wives after his death - is forbidden and regarded as a great sin by Allah."
"Whether you discuss a thing or conceal it, surely God has knowledge of everything.",53,33,إِن تُبْدُوا۟ شَيْـًٔا أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا,"If you reveal any of your actions or keep them to yourselves secretly, none of them are hidden to Allah anyway. Indeed, Allah knows everything none of your actions or anything else is hidden from Him, and He will requite you for your deeds: if good then with good, and if evil then with bad."
"There is no harm if they come before their fathers or their sons, or their brothers and their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women folk or captive maids they possess. Follow the commands of God. Verily God is witness to everything.",54,33,لَّا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِنَّ فِىٓ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ وَلَآ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ وَلَآ إِخْوَٰنِهِنَّ وَلَآ أَبْنَآءِ إِخْوَٰنِهِنَّ وَلَآ أَبْنَآءِ أَخَوَٰتِهِنَّ وَلَا نِسَآئِهِنَّ وَلَا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُنَّ وَٱتَّقِينَ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدًا,"There is no sin on the wives of the Messenger if their fathers, sons, brothers, nephews, from lineage or breast feeding, see them and talk to them without a veil. And there is no sin on them if believing women or the servants they possess talk to them without a veil. O believing women! Be mindful of Allah in whatever He (may He be glorified) has commanded you to do and prohibited you from, because He is Watchful over what you do."
"God and His angels shower their blessings on the Prophet. O believers, you should also send your blessings on him, and salute him with a worthy greeting.",55,33,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَمَلَٰٓئِكَتَهُۥ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ صَلُّوا۟ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا۟ تَسْلِيمًا,"Indeed, Allah showers praise upon the Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) to His angels, and His angels supplicate for him. O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever He has legislated for His servants! Send salutations upon the Messenger and pray for peace for him abundantly."
Those who offend God and His Prophet will be damned in this world and the next. There is a shameful punishment ready for them.,56,33,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا,"Indeed, those who attempt to bring harm to Allah and His messenger through speech or action, Allah will distance them from the vastness of His mercy in the world and the Hereafter, and He has prepared a humiliating punishment for them in the Hereafter."
"Those who slander believing men and women for what they have not done, will bear the burden of calumny and clear iniquity.",57,33,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ بِغَيْرِ مَا ٱكْتَسَبُوا۟ فَقَدِ ٱحْتَمَلُوا۟ بُهْتَٰنًا وَإِثْمًا مُّبِينًا,"And as for those who cause the male and female believers inconvenience through speech or actions, without them having committed any wrong i.e. a crime that necessitates punishment, they have indeed, taken up the burden of clear slander and sin."
"O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the women of the faithful, to draw their wraps a little over them. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them. God is forgiving and kind.",58,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَٰجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَٰبِيبِهِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,"O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters, and the wives of the believers: “Let your outer garments you wear hang loosely over you so that your bodies are not revealed to unrelated men.” That is more likely to distinguish them as free women so that they are not subject to harassment like the servant girls are. And Allah Forgiving of the sins of whichever of His servants repents, and He is merciful to them."
"If the hypocrites and perverts, and the rumour-mongers of Madinah, do not desist even now, We shall rouse you against them, so they would not be able to live but a short time in the city with you.",59,33,لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْمُرْجِفُونَ فِى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لَا يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"The hypocrites who conceal their disbelief and outwardly show Islam, whose hearts are transgressive in nature by being attached to their desires, and who spread false information in Al-Madīnah to create disunity among the believers, if they do not stop their hypocrisy, O Messenger, I will definitely command you to punish them and impose a punishment upon them. Then, they will not be able to live in Al-Madīnah with you except for a short while, because of their destruction or exile as a result of their causing corruption on Earth."
"Accursed, they would be seized wherever found, and slain mercilessly.",60,33,مَّلْعُونِينَ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُوٓا۟ أُخِذُوا۟ وَقُتِّلُوا۟ تَقْتِيلًا,They are exiled from the mercy of Allah; in whatever place they are found they will be seized and eliminated because of their hypocrisy and spreading corruption on Earth.
Such was the law of God among those before you; and you will not find any change in the law of God.,61,33,سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًا,This is the divine custom of Allah that is in force regarding the hypocrites when they reveal their hypocrisy. And the custom of Allah is permanent; you will never find any change in it.
"People ask you about the Hour (of the great change). Say: ""Only God has knowledge of it. Who knows? The Hour may be close at hand.""",62,33,يَسْـَٔلُكَ ٱلنَّاسُ عَنِ ٱلسَّاعَةِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ تَكُونُ قَرِيبًا,"O Messenger! The idolaters ask you in denial and rejection, and the Jews also ask you, regarding the final hour: “When will it occur?” Say to them: “The knowledge of the hour is with Allah; I have no knowledge of it.” O Messenger! What do you know, the hour could be near!"
"Verily God has cursed the infidels, and prepared a blazing fire for them.",63,33,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ سَعِيرًا,"Indeed, Allah (may He be glorified) has exiled the disbelievers from His mercy, and prepared a flaring fire that awaits them on the Day of Judgement."
"They will live in it for ever, and will find no saviour or helper.",64,33,خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا لَّا يَجِدُونَ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"They will remain in the punishment of that fire forever. They will not find a guardian that benefits them in it, nor a helper who protects them from its punishment."
"The day their faces would be turned on the fire (as on a spit), they will say: ""Alas! If only we had obeyed God, and obeyed the Prophet.""",65,33,يَوْمَ تُقَلَّبُ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى ٱلنَّارِ يَقُولُونَ يَٰلَيْتَنَآ أَطَعْنَا ٱللَّهَ وَأَطَعْنَا ٱلرَّسُولَا۠,"On the Day of Judgement their faces will be turned in the hellfire, and they will say out of severe regret and remorse: “If only we obeyed Allah by doing what He commanded us to and refrained from the things He prohibited us from, and obeyed the Messenger in what he brought from his Lord!”"
"They will say: ""O our Lord, we obeyed our leaders and the elders, but they only led us astray.",66,33,وَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّآ أَطَعْنَا سَادَتَنَا وَكُبَرَآءَنَا فَأَضَلُّونَا ٱلسَّبِيلَا۠,"These people will come up with a false, weak excuse when they will say: “O our Lord! Indeed, we obeyed our leaders and the elders of our tribes and they led us astray from the straight path.”"
"O Lord, give them a double punishment, and put a grievous curse upon them.""",67,33,رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِهِمْ ضِعْفَيْنِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَٱلْعَنْهُمْ لَعْنًا كَبِيرًا,"“Our Lord! Give these leaders and elders who led us astray from the straight path double the punishment you have given us because of their leading us astray, and exile them from your mercy completely.”"
"O you who believe, do not be like those who maligned Moses, whilst God cleared him of what they alleged; and he was held in high esteem with God.",68,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاذَوْا۟ مُوسَىٰ فَبَرَّأَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِمَّا قَالُوا۟ وَكَانَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَجِيهًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever Allah has legislated for them! Do not cause your Messenger inconvenience like those who caused Moses inconvenience by saying that his testicles were inflamed, and so Allah cleared him of their allegations, and his innocence from their accusations of him became clear to them. Moses is highly ranked according to Allah; his supplications were not rejected, nor were his efforts in vain."
"O you who believe, obey the commands of God, and say straightforward things",69,33,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَقُولُوا۟ قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا,"O those who have faith in Allah and do whatever Allah has legislated for them! Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited, and speak correctly and truthfully."
That He may straighten your affairs for you and forgive your sins; and he who obeys God and His Prophet will be successful.,70,33,يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَٰلَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا,"Indeed, if you are mindful of Allah and speak correctly, Allah will rectify your deeds for you, accept them from you, wipe away your sins from you and not take you to account over them. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has succeeded so greatly no other success can match it: it is the success of acquiring the pleasure of Allah and entering Paradise."
"We had offered the Trust (of divine responsibilities) to the heavens, the earth, the mountains, but they refrained from bearing the burden and were frightened of it; but man took it on himself. He is a faithless ignoramus.",71,33,إِنَّا عَرَضْنَا ٱلْأَمَانَةَ عَلَى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلْجِبَالِ فَأَبَيْنَ أَن يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ ظَلُومًا جَهُولًا,"Indeed, I presented to the heavens, the earth and to the mountains the obligation to adhere to religion and guarding of wealth and secrets. They all refuse to bear the obligation, fearing the outcome of doing so, but the human accepted to carry it. Indeed, the human is oppressive to himself and ignorant of the outcome of carrying such a burden."
"So that God punishes men and women hypocrites, the idolaters and idolatrous women, but He turns to faithful men and women in forgiveness, for God is forgiving and kind.",72,33,لِّيُعَذِّبَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقَٰتِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَٱلْمُشْرِكَٰتِ وَيَتُوبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًۢا,"The human carried it as per the decree of Allah, so that Allah could then punish the male and female hypocrites and idolaters for their hypocrisy and ascribing partners with Allah, and so that He could forgive the believing men and women who carried the burden of obligation well. And Allah Forgiving of the sins of His servants who repent and is merciful to them."
"ALL PRAISE BE to God to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and His the praise in the world to come. He is all-wise and all-knowing.",0,34,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"All praise belongs to Allah to whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and everything that is on Earth, by way of being His creation, in His ownership and under His control. And for Him is all praise in the Hereafter; He is the Wise in His creation and management, and the Knower of the conditions of His servants. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatsoever issues from it, whatsoever comes down from the sky, and whatsoever goes up to it. He is all-merciful, all-forgiving.",1,34,يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلِجُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا وَهُوَ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ٱلْغَفُورُ,"He knows everything that enters the earth, i.e. water, seeds and minerals; He knows whatever comes out of it i.e. plants etc.; He knows whatever descends from the heavens i.e. rain, angels and sustenance, and He knows whatever ascends to the heavens i.e. angels, the deeds of His servants and their souls. He is merciful to His believing servants and forgiving of the sins of whoever repents to Him."
"The unbelievers say: ""There is no coming of the Hour for us."" Say: ""Why not? By my Lord, the knower of the unknown, it will certainly come for you. Not even an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, or something smaller or greater than it, is hidden from Him, and which is not recorded in the all-too-manifest Book,",2,34,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَا تَأْتِينَا ٱلسَّاعَةُ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّى لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَآ أَصْغَرُ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَآ أَكْبَرُ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah said, “The hour will never come to us!” O Messenger! Say to them: “No, by Allah, the very hour that you reject will definitely come to you, but its time is only known to Allah. He (may He be glorified) is the knower of whatever is hidden such as the hour, even the equivalent of the smallest ant is not hidden from His knowledge, nor anything smaller than that in the heavens or on Earth or larger, except that it is recorded in a clear book, which is the Preserved Tablet in which everything that is to happen until the Day of Judgement is recorded.”"
In order that He may recompense those who have believed and done the right. For them will be forgiveness and worthy sustenance.,3,34,لِّيَجْزِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Allah has recorded everything He has in the Preserved Tablet so that He may requite those who have faith in Him and do good deeds. They will receive forgiveness from Allah for their sins; He will not take them to account for them, and they will receive generous sustenance on the Day of Judgement, which is His Paradise."
"As for those who try to subvert Our signs, there is a punishment of painful torment.",4,34,وَٱلَّذِينَ سَعَوْ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا مُعَٰجِزِينَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مِّن رِّجْزٍ أَلِيمٌ,"As for those who strove to falsify all the verses Allah revealed, and said regarding them, “It is sorcery!” and said regarding My Messenger, “He is a fortune-teller, a sorcerer, and a poet”, they will receive the worst and severest punishment on the Day of Judgement."
"Those who have been given knowledge realise what has been revealed by the Lord is the truth, and leads to the path of the mighty and praiseworthy (God).",5,34,وَيَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيَهْدِىٓ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,"Some scholars of the people of the book i.e. Abdullah bin Salām testify that the revelation Allah revealed to you is the truth without doubt, and it guides towards the path of the Almighty whom no one can beat and who is praiseworthy in the world and the Hereafter."
"The disbelievers say: ""Shall we tell you of a man who prophesies that when you are reduced to particles and vanished in the dust, you will become a new creation",6,34,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ هَلْ نَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ يُنَبِّئُكُمْ إِذَا مُزِّقْتُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّكُمْ لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah say to one another in astonishment and mocking whatever the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought, “Shall we lead you to a man who will tell you that when you die and decompose into pieces, you will be resurrected alive again?!”"
"Has he fabricated a lie about God, or is he possessed?"" Not so; but those who believe not in the Hereafter are themselves afflicted and far astray.",7,34,أَفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَم بِهِۦ جِنَّةٌۢ بَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ وَٱلضَّلَٰلِ ٱلْبَعِيدِ,"And they said, “Has this man fabricated and attributed a lie to Allah, claiming that we shall be resurrected after we die, or is he insane, talking of nonsense?” It is not as these people say, rather, the reality is that those who do not believe in the Hereafter will suffer a severe punishment on the Day of Judgement, and are very far astray in the world."
"Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth? We could cleave the earth and sink them, if We pleased, or drop a fragment of the sky upon them. There is surely a sign in this for every penitent creature.",8,34,أَفَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِن نَّشَأْ نَخْسِفْ بِهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ أَوْ نُسْقِطْ عَلَيْهِمْ كِسَفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ,"Do these rejectors of resurrection not see the earth that is in front of them and the sky that is above them? If I wished the earth beneath their feet to swallow them up, I would have caused it to happen; and if I wished to send down portions/pieces of the punishment from the heavens, I would have done so. Indeed, there is a clear sign in that for every repentant servant through which he witnesses the power of Allah. The One capable of doing that, is also capable of resurrecting you after your death and the decomposition of your bodies."
"We favoured David with excellence, (and commanded): ""O Jibal and Tair, glorify the greatness of God with him."" And We made iron pliable for him.",9,34,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُۥدَ مِنَّا فَضْلًا يَٰجِبَالُ أَوِّبِى مَعَهُۥ وَٱلطَّيْرَ وَأَلَنَّا لَهُ ٱلْحَدِيدَ,"And verily I granted David (peace be upon him) messengership and a kingdom, and I said to the mountains, ”O Mountains! Echo My glorification together with David.” and I said the same to the birds. I also made iron soft for him so that he could make whatever tools he wanted with it."
"""Make long coats of mail,"" (We said), ""and fix their links, and do the right. I surely see whatsoever you do.""",10,34,أَنِ ٱعْمَلْ سَٰبِغَٰتٍ وَقَدِّرْ فِى ٱلسَّرْدِ وَٱعْمَلُوا۟ صَٰلِحًا إِنِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"O David! Make an expansive armour which will protect your soldiers from the attacks of their enemies, and make the rivets in proportion to the rings so that they are not too fine such that do not lodge in them, nor too thick such that they do not fit in them either. And do good deeds; I am watching over your actions, none of your actions are hidden from Me and I shall requite you for them."
"We (subjugated) the wind to Solomon. Its morning's journey took one month, and the evening's one month. We made a spring of molten brass to flow for him; and many jinns laboured for him by the will of his Lord. Anyone of them who turned from Our command was made to taste the torment of blazing fire.",11,34,وَلِسُلَيْمَٰنَ ٱلرِّيحَ غُدُوُّهَا شَهْرٌ وَرَوَاحُهَا شَهْرٌ وَأَسَلْنَا لَهُۥ عَيْنَ ٱلْقِطْرِ وَمِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ مَن يَعْمَلُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِۦ وَمَن يَزِغْ مِنْهُمْ عَنْ أَمْرِنَا نُذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"And I made the wind serviceable to Solomon, son of David. It would blow the distance of a month in a morning, and the same distance in an evening. I also made springs of copper flow for him so that he could make whatever he wanted from it, together with employing the Jinn who would work in front of him by the command of his Lord. Whichever of the Jinn would deviate from whatever I commanded it to do, I would make it taste the punishment of a flaring fire."
"They made for him whatever he wished, synagogues and statues, dishes large as water-troughs, and cauldrons firmly fixed (on ovens; and We said): ""O House of David, act, and give thanks."" But few among My creatures are thankful.",12,34,يَعْمَلُونَ لَهُۥ مَا يَشَآءُ مِن مَّحَٰرِيبَ وَتَمَٰثِيلَ وَجِفَانٍ كَٱلْجَوَابِ وَقُدُورٍ رَّاسِيَٰتٍ ٱعْمَلُوٓا۟ ءَالَ دَاوُۥدَ شُكْرًا وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِىَ ٱلشَّكُورُ,"These Jinn constructed for him whatever he wanted from places of worship, palaces, lofty structures. And I said to them: O the family of David! Be grateful for the blessings I have bestowed upon you, because very few of My servants are grateful to Me for the blessings I grant them."
"When We ordained (Solomon's) death, none but the weevil, that was eating away his staff (on which he rested), pointed out to them that he was dead. When he fell down (dead) the jinns realised that if they had knowledge of the Unknown they would never have suffered demeaning labour.",13,34,فَلَمَّا قَضَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ ٱلْمَوْتَ مَا دَلَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَوْتِهِۦٓ إِلَّا دَآبَّةُ ٱلْأَرْضِ تَأْكُلُ مِنسَأَتَهُۥ فَلَمَّا خَرَّ تَبَيَّنَتِ ٱلْجِنُّ أَن لَّوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْغَيْبَ مَا لَبِثُوا۟ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْمُهِينِ,"When we decreed for Solomon to die, the Jinn did not realise he had passed away until the woodworms had eroded away the staff he was leaning on. When he fell it became clear to the Jinn that they do not know the unseen/ghayb, as if they did, they would have not remained subdued, continuing to carry out the difficult tasks imposed upon them."
"There was a sign for the people of Saba in their habitations: Two gardens, on the right and left. (And they were told:) ""Eat of what your Lord has given you and be thankful. Fair is your land, and forgiving your Lord.""",14,34,لَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَإٍ فِى مَسْكَنِهِمْ ءَايَةٌ جَنَّتَانِ عَن يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ كُلُوا۟ مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لَهُۥ بَلْدَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ,"There was for the tribe of Sheba, in the dwelling they lived in, a clear sign of Allah’s power and His favour on them, and the clear sign was two gardens: one on the right and the second on the left. And I said to them: “Eat of the provision of your Lord and thank Him for His favours. This is a pleasant city and you Lord, Allah is a forgiving Lord, who absolves the sins of those who repent to Him.”"
"But they turned away. So We let loose on them the inundation of (the dyke of) al-'Arim, replacing their gardens with two other gardens which bore only bitter gourd, and tamarisks and a few sparse lote-trees.",15,34,فَأَعْرَضُوا۟ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ ٱلْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَٰهُم بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَىْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَىْءٍ مِّن سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ,"But they turned away from thanking Allah and believing in His messengers, so I punished them by turning their favours into difficulties, then I sent upon them a strong flood which destroyed their damn and flooded their fields. And I replaced their two pleasant gardens with two gardens which gave bitter fruit, and which contained fruitless tamarisk trees and a small amount of the lote tree (sidr)."
That is how We requited them for their ingratitude. We only punish those who are ungrateful.,16,34,ذَٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَٰهُم بِمَا كَفَرُوا۟ وَهَلْ نُجَٰزِىٓ إِلَّا ٱلْكَفُورَ,That change which occurred to the favours they were on was because of their disbelief and turning away from being thankful for the favours. And I do not punish so severely except one who rejects Allah’s favours.
"Between them and the cities We had blessed We placed towns along the highway, and made them stages on their journey, (saying): ""Travel between them in safety by day or by night.""",17,34,وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ ٱلْقُرَى ٱلَّتِى بَٰرَكْنَا فِيهَا قُرًى ظَٰهِرَةً وَقَدَّرْنَا فِيهَا ٱلسَّيْرَ سِيرُوا۟ فِيهَا لَيَالِىَ وَأَيَّامًا ءَامِنِينَ,"And I made between the people of Sheba in Yemen and between the cities of the blessed land of Levant, many neighbouring cities, making easier for them the distance of travelling, so they may pass through these cities and towns, stopping when needed, without any difficulty until they reach the land of Levant. And we announced: “Travel through them day and night in complete security from any enemy, hunger or thirst”."
"But they said: ""O Lord, make the distance between the stages of our journeys longer;"" but (by doing so) they wronged themselves. So We turned them into bygone tales, and dispersed them, scattered in all directions. Surely there are signs in this for those who endeavour and are grateful.",18,34,فَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا بَٰعِدْ بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا وَظَلَمُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ وَمَزَّقْنَٰهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,"But they arrogantly rejected Allah's favour of facilitating their journey and they said: “Our Lord, make our journeys longer by removing those cities in between so that we can have a taste of the exhaustion of travelling, and we can make clear the excellence of our riding mounts”. And they wronged themselves by arrogantly rejecting Allah’s favour, turning away from thanking Him, so I made them into tales which those after them talk of and I totally separated between them in the lands so they cannot reach each other. In that which has been mentioned, namely favouring the people of Sheba and taking retribution from them, is a lesson for every person who is patient in is obediance to Allah, and bearing what he has been afflicted with, who is thankful for Allah’s favours on him."
Thus Iblis found his supposition about them to be true; and except for a section of believers they follow him.,19,34,وَلَقَدْ صَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُۥ فَٱتَّبَعُوهُ إِلَّا فَرِيقًا مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"And Iblis confirmed through them what he assumed i.e., that he is able to lead them astray and misguide them from the truth, so they followed him in disbelief and misguidance except a group of the believers, as they ruined his hope by not following him."
"He had no authority over them save for the purpose of Our knowing who believed in the world to come, and who doubted it. For your Lord keeps a watch over everything.",20,34,وَمَا كَانَ لَهُۥ عَلَيْهِم مِّن سُلْطَٰنٍ إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِمَّنْ هُوَ مِنْهَا فِى شَكٍّ وَرَبُّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَفِيظٌ,"And Iblis has no power over them through which he can force them to be misguided, but he only beautifies for them to entice them to lead them astray. We have given him permission to entice so we can make it clear the one who has faith in the Hereafter from the one who is in doubt about the Hereafter. And your Lord, O Messenger, is a Guardian over everything. He guards the actions of His servants and will reward them for them."
"Say: ""Call on those you imagine are gods apart from God. They are not masters even of an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, nor do they have a share in them, nor is any one of them a helper (of God).",21,34,قُلِ ٱدْعُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِيهِمَا مِن شِرْكٍ وَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْهُم مِّن ظَهِيرٍ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “Call upon those whom you claimed were your gods besides Allah, so that they can bring you benefit or remove harm from you. They do not have ownership of anything, even as small as a dust particle, nor are they partners with Allah in ownership, nor does Allah have any helpers from amongst them. He is Self Sufficient, in no need of anyone else."
"No intercession avails with Him except his He allows, so that when their hearts are freed of fear, they ask (one another): ""What did your Lord say?"" They will answer: ""What is expedient. He is the all-mighty and supreme.""",22,34,وَلَا تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُۥ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا۟ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوا۟ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"And intercession in His presence does not benefit except for one whom Allah gives permission, and Allah does not give permission to intercede except for whom He is pleased, due to His greatness. And part of His greatness is that when He speaks in the heavens, the angels flap their wings in submission to what He says, until when the state of fear dissappears from their hearts some of them say to others: “What did your Lord just say?” The angels reply He said the truth, and He is High in His essence, and subduing, the Great."
"Say: ""Who gives you food from the heavens and the earth?"" Say: ""God. Surely either you or we are on guidance, or are lost in clear error.""",23,34,قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “Who provides you from the skies by bringing out the crops, plants and fruits?” Say: “It is Allah who provides you. O idolaters! only one of us can be rightly guided with the other on clear misguidance. There can be no doubt that the believers are on clear guidance and the idolaters are misguided.”"
"Say: ""You will not be questioned about the sins that we have committed, nor shall we be questioned about your deeds.""",24,34,قُل لَّا تُسْـَٔلُونَ عَمَّآ أَجْرَمْنَا وَلَا نُسْـَٔلُ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,O Messenger! Say to them: “You will not be asked on the day of judgment about the sins we committed nor will we be asked about what you used to do”.
"Say: ""Our Lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably, for He is the Judge all-knowing.""",25,34,قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُوَ ٱلْفَتَّاحُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Say to them: “Allah will gather us and you on the day of judgment, then He will judge between us and you with justice, then He will manifest the truthful from the liar, and He is the Judge who adjudicates with justice, the all Knowing of how to pass judgment."
"Say: ""Just show me those you associate with Him as compeers."" No, (you cannot), for He is God, the all-mighty and all-wise.""",26,34,قُلْ أَرُونِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَلْحَقْتُم بِهِۦ شُرَكَآءَ كَلَّا بَلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"O Messenger! Say to them: “Show me those whom you have made for Allah as partners which you associate with Him in worship. No indeed, the matter is not as you have thought, i.e, that He has partners, but rather He is Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in his creation, decree, and control.”."
We have sent you only as a bearer of good tidings and admonisher for all mankind; yet most people do not understand.,27,34,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ إِلَّا كَآفَّةً لِّلنَّاسِ بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"And I did not send you, O Messenger, except for the sake of all of mankind, to give good news to the pious that for them is Paradise, and to warn the disbelievers and transgressors of the fire, but most people do not know that. Had they known, they would not have denied you."
"Instead they say: ""When is this promise going to be, if you speak the truth?""",28,34,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"And the idolaters say, whilst hastily seeking the punishment you are warning them of: “If you are truthful tell us When is this promise of punishment going to occur?”"
"Say: ""Determined is the day of the promise, which you can neither put back nor advance an hour.''",29,34,قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لَّا تَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلَا تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these people who are hastily seeking the punishment: “For you is a fixed appointed time, when the time comes upon you it will not be delayed or preceded for the smallest moment of time. And this day is the day of judgment”."
"The unbelievers say: ""We do not believe in this Qur'an, nor in what was (sent) before it."" If only you could see the sinners when they are made to stand before their Lord, blaming one another! Those who were weak will say to those who were arrogant: ""But for you we would have certainly been believers.""",30,34,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ بِهَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَلَا بِٱلَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذِ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ مَوْقُوفُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ٱلْقَوْلَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أَنتُمْ لَكُنَّا مُؤْمِنِينَ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah said: “We will never believe in the Qur’ān which Muhammad claim is revealed to him nor will we ever believe in the previous divine books”. And if you were to see, O Messenger, when the wrongdoers are detained before their Lord on the day of judgment for the reckoning. They will dispute with one another, each one placing the responsibility and blame on the other. The subjects/citizens who were subdued will say to their leaders who oppressed them in this life: “If you had not led us astray, we would have been believers in Allah and His messengers”."
"The arrogant will say to the weak: ""Did we hold you back from guidance after it had come to you? Certainly not. In fact you were yourselves guilty.""",31,34,قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوٓا۟ أَنَحْنُ صَدَدْنَٰكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْهُدَىٰ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَكُم بَلْ كُنتُم مُّجْرِمِينَ,"The leaders who were arrogant to the truth will say to the followers they oppressed: “Did we stop you from the guidance which Muhammad brought? No, but rather you were the wrongdoers and the people who were corrupt spreading immorality.”"
"But the weak will say to the arrogant: ""Not in the least. It was your plotting night and day when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and associate compeers with Him."" When they see the punishment they will express repentance. But We shall put iron collars round the necks of infidels. Will they be requited for anything but what they did?",32,34,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ بَلْ مَكْرُ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَآ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُۥٓ أَندَادًا وَأَسَرُّوا۟ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلْأَغْلَٰلَ فِىٓ أَعْنَاقِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"The followers who were oppressed by their leaders will say to their leaders who were arrogant to the truth: “But your scheming about us night and day stopped us from guidance, when you would order us to disbelieve in Allah and to worship creations besides Him”. And they will hide the regret over the disbelief they were on in this world when they see the punishment, and they will know they are going to be punished. And I will put chains on the necks of the disbelievers. They will not be given this reward except for what they used to do in the world, namely worshipping others besides Allah and committing sins."
"We never sent an admonisher to a habitation but its well-to-do people said: ""We do not believe in what you have brought.""",33,34,وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلَّا قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"I have not sent a messenger in any city to warn of Allah’s punishment except that the affluent people in it amongst those of power, fame and wealth said: “We are of what you have been sent with, O messengers, disbelievers”."
"And (further): ""We have far more wealth and children (than you), and we are not the ones to be punished.""",34,34,وَقَالُوا۟ نَحْنُ أَكْثَرُ أَمْوَٰلًا وَأَوْلَٰدًا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ,"And these people of fame said braggingly and boastfully: “We are more in wealth and more in children. And your claim that we will be punished is a lie, as we will not be punished in this world nor in the Hereafter”."
"Say: ""Verily my Lord increases or restricts the provision of whosoever He will;"" but most men do not understand.",35,34,قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّى يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, say to these who have been deceived by the favours they have been given: “My Lord expands provision for whom He wants, to test whether he is grateful or ungrateful, and He makes it tight for whom He wants, to test whether he is patient or becomes upset. But most people do not know that Allah is Wise. He does not decree a matter except due to complete wisdom which is known to those who know and which the ignorant are unaware of”."
"It is not your wealth and children that will bring you closer to Us, except those who believe and do the right. These will be given a two-fold reward for their deeds, and will dwell in peace in the high empyrean.",36,34,وَمَآ أَمْوَٰلُكُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُكُم بِٱلَّتِى تُقَرِّبُكُمْ عِندَنَا زُلْفَىٰٓ إِلَّا مَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَآءُ ٱلضِّعْفِ بِمَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَهُمْ فِى ٱلْغُرُفَٰتِ ءَامِنُونَ,"And your wealth and your children which you boast over are not what leads you to Allah’s pleasure, but the one who believes in Allah and does good actions has acquired has acquired a multiplied reward. His wealth draws him closer to Allah by him spending it in Allah's way, and his children also are a means for raising his rank, by their prayers for him. So those believers who do good deeds - for them is a multiple reward for the good they did and they will be in the higher ranks of Paradise, safe from whatever they fear; punishment, death and ending of joy."
But those who try to subvert Our signs will be given over to punishment,37,34,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَسْعَوْنَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا مُعَٰجِزِينَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ مُحْضَرُونَ,And the disbelievers who make it their utmost effort to turn people away from our verses and strive hard to achieve these goals of theirs are losers in this world and will be punished in the Hereafter.
"Say: ""Verily my Lord increases or restricts the provision of any of His creatures as He will, and repays whatsoever you spend. He is the best of all providers.""",38,34,قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّى يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَقْدِرُ لَهُۥ وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُۥ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"O Messenger, say: “My Lord expands provision for whom He wants from His creation and makes it tight for whom He wants. And whatever you spend in Allah’s way, Allah will replace it for you in this world by giving you what is better than it and by giving you great reward in the Hereafter. And Allah is the best of providers, so whoever seeks provision should resort to Him”."
"The day He will gather all of them together, He will ask the angels: ""Did they worship you?""",39,34,وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ يَقُولُ لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ أَهَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْبُدُونَ,"O Messenger, remember the day Allah will gather them all, then Allah will say to the angels, to scold the idolaters and rebuke them: “Are these the ones who used to worship you in the worldly life besides Allah?”"
"""God forbid!"" (they will answer). ""You are our protector not they. In fact, they worshipped the devils. Most of them believed in them.""",40,34,قَالُوا۟ سُبْحَٰنَكَ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِم بَلْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱلْجِنَّ أَكْثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ,"The angels will say: “You are pure and exalted. You are our guardian, not them, so there is no friendship between us and them, but rather these idolaters used to worship the satans. They used to appear to them as angels, so they would worship them besides Allah, most of them were believers in them”."
"That day you will have no power to profit or harm each other; and We shall say to the sinners: ""Taste the punishment of Fire which you had denied.""",41,34,فَٱلْيَوْمَ لَا يَمْلِكُ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ نَّفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا وَنَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٱلَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,"On the day of gathering and reckoning, the worshipped will not be able to benefit those who worshipped them besides Allah in the world nor will they be able to harm them. And I will say to those who wronged themselves through disbelief and sins: “Taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny in the world”."
"When Our clear revelations are read out to them, they say: ""This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your fathers used to worship."" And they say: ""This is nothing but a fabricated lie."" And those who do not believe say of the truth when it has reached them: ""This is nothing but pure sorcery.""",42,34,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالُوا۟ مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّا رَجُلٌ يُرِيدُ أَن يَصُدَّكُمْ عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ وَقَالُوا۟ مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ إِفْكٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"And when you read to these denying idolaters our clear verses revealed to our Messenger and in which there is no uncertainty they say: “""This is a mere human being who has brought this message to divert us away from the path of our forefathers”. And they said: “The Qur’ān is nothing but a fabricated lie against Allah”. And those who disbelieved in Allah said regarding the Qur’ān when it came to them from Allah: “This is nothing but clear magic to separate between husband and wife, and son and father”."
"We did not give them any scripture to study, nor sent any warner before you.",43,34,وَمَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن كُتُبٍ يَدْرُسُونَهَا وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ مِن نَّذِيرٍ,"And I have not give them books which they are reading, which may be a reason for them to pass judgement on the Qur’ān being a lie which Muhammad fabricated, nor did I send towards them, before sending you O Messenger, a messenger who would warn them of Allah’s punishment."
"Those before them had also denied, and they could not reach a tenth of (the possibilities) We had given them, and still they called My apostles liars. How great was the change that I wrought in their condition then!",44,34,وَكَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَمَا بَلَغُوا۟ مِعْشَارَ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ فَكَذَّبُوا۟ رُسُلِى فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,"And the previous nations such as Aad, Thamud and the people of Lot denied. And the idolaters from your people have not reached even a tenth of the strength, might and numbers the previous nations reached. Every one of them denied their Messenger, so the wealth, strength and numbers they were given did not benefit, and so My punishment befell them. So see the outcome of My reproachment and that of My punishment."
"Say: ""I urge upon you only one thing: Stand up for God two by two or one by one, and think and reflect!"" There is no madness about your companion. He is a warner against the dreadful affliction (that awaits).",45,34,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُم بِوَٰحِدَةٍ أَن تَقُومُوا۟ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَىٰ وَفُرَٰدَىٰ ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُوا۟ مَا بِصَاحِبِكُم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ لَّكُم بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “I only direct you to and advise you of one characteristic, which is that you stand free from desires, for Allah’s sake, in twos and individually, then think about the life of your companion and what you know of his intelligence, truthfulness and trustworthiness”, so that it becomes clear to you that he (peace be upon him) is not insane. He is not but a warner to you before a severe punishment, if you do not repent to Allah from associating partners with Him."
"Say: ""The reward I ask is for yourself. My reward is due from none but God; and He is witness over everything.""",46,34,قُلْ مَا سَأَلْتُكُم مِّنْ أَجْرٍ فَهُوَ لَكُمْ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: “Whatever reward or payment I ask you for the guidance and good I have brought you, then it is - assuming it exists - for you. My reward is only with Allah alone, and He is Witness to everything. He witnesses that I have conveyed to you, and witnesses your actions and will then give you their full reward”."
"Say: ""My Lord casts the truth: He is the knower of things unknown.""",47,34,قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّى يَقْذِفُ بِٱلْحَقِّ عَلَّٰمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,"O Messenger, say: “My Lord will empower the truth over falsehood, thus invalidating it, and He is Knower of the Ghaib. Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from Him, and the actions of His servants are not hidden from Him”."
"Say: ""The truth has come, and falsehood had neither precedence nor will reappear.""",48,34,قُلْ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا يُبْدِئُ ٱلْبَٰطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: “The truth which is Islam has come, and falsehood which has no effect or supremacy has gone, and it will not return to its dominance”."
"Say: ""If I am in error it is to my own loss; if I am on guidance that is so because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is all-hearing and all-too-near.""",49,34,قُلْ إِن ضَلَلْتُ فَإِنَّمَآ أَضِلُّ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِى وَإِنِ ٱهْتَدَيْتُ فَبِمَا يُوحِىٓ إِلَىَّ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّهُۥ سَمِيعٌ قَرِيبٌ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: “If I go astray from the truth in what I convey to you, the harm of my misguidance is confined to me. None of it will affect you. And if I am guided to Him, it is due to what my Lord reveals to me. He is Hearing of the sayings of His servants and Near, it not being difficult for Him to hear what I say”."
"If you could see when they are gripped by terror without any escape, and are seized from close at hand",50,34,وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذْ فَزِعُوا۟ فَلَا فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُوا۟ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ,"And if you were to see, O Messenger, when these deniers will be terrified when they see the punishment on the day of judgment. So there will be no place for them to run to from it, nor any refuge for them to resort to, and they will be seized from a nearby place which is easy to reach from the very beginning. If you were to see that, you would see a strange matter."
"They will say: ""We believe in it."" How could they reach it from a place of no return?",51,34,وَقَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ وَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمُ ٱلتَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"And they will say when they see their fate: “We have brought faith in the day of judgment”, but how will they pursue and acquire faith when the place for accepting faith has gone far from them, by their leaving the worldly abode, the abode of action and no reward, to the abode of the Hereafter, the abode of reward and no action?"
They had surely denied it before and aimed without seeing from so far away.,52,34,وَقَدْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِهِۦ مِن قَبْلُ وَيَقْذِفُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ مِن مَّكَانٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"And how will faith be attained for them and accepted from them, when they had disbelieved in it in the worldly life and would suspiciously accuse from a direction far from the truth, thus saying about the Messenger (peace be upon him): magician, soothsayer and poet?"
"A barrier shall be raised between them and what they desired, as was done with their partisans before. They too were filled with disquieting doubt.",53,34,وَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَاعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ فِى شَكٍّ مُّرِيبٍۭ,"And these deniers were prevented from that which they desire, from the pleasure of this life, as well as repentance from disbelief, salvation from the fire and returning to the worldly life, just as was done with their likes from the nations before them who denied. They were in doubt about what the messengers brought, i.e., believing the Oneness of Allah and faith in the resurrection."
"ALL PRAISE BE to God, the originator of the heavens and the earth, who appointed angels as His messengers, with wings, two, three and four. He adds what He pleases to His creation. He has certainly power over everything.",0,35,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ جَاعِلِ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ رُسُلًا أُو۟لِىٓ أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ يَزِيدُ فِى ٱلْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"All praise is for Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth without a precedent, and who made from the angels messengers who execute His regulatory commands. Some of them convey the revelation to the Prophets and strengthen them to perform what they were entrusted with. Some of them have two, three or four wings through which they fly to carry out what they have been ordered. Allah increases His creation in what He wishes of limbs, beauty or voice. Allah is Powerful over everything. Nothing is outside His ability."
There is none who can take away the favours He bestows on man; and there is none apart from Him to restore what He has withheld. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,1,35,مَّا يَفْتَحِ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍ فَلَا مُمْسِكَ لَهَا وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلَا مُرْسِلَ لَهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"The keys to everything are in Allah's hands. So whatever provision, guidance or good fortune He opens up for people, nobody has the ability to stop it. And whatever He stops of this, there is nobody who is able to send it after He has stopped it. And He is the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in His creating, decreeing and planning."
"O you people, remember the favours of God to you. Is there any creator other than God who gives you food from the heavens and the earth? There is no god but He: How then can you turn aside?",2,35,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ هَلْ مِنْ خَٰلِقٍ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,"O people, remember Allah’s favour on you through your hearts and tongues, and through your limbs by action. Do you have any creator besides Allah who provides you from the sky with the water He sends to you and who provides you from the earth with the fruits and crops He grows? There is no true god besides Him. So how after this do you turn away from this truth and fabricate lies against Allah, and claim that Allah has partners when He is the one who created all of you and provides for all of you?"
"If they call you a liar, so have other messengers been denied before you. But all things will be brought back to God.",3,35,وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"And if your people deny you, O Messenger, be patient, because you are not the first Messenger whose people denied him, as nations before you had denied their prophets, such as Aad, Thamud and the people of Lot. And to Allah alone all matters are returned, so He will destroy the deniers and help His messengers and the believers."
"O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.",4,35,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَلَا تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَا يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,"O people, the resurrection and recompense on the day of judgment which Allah has promised you are true without a doubt, so the pleasures of the worldly life and its desires should not deceive you from preparing for this day through good actions, nor should the Satan deceive you by his adornment of falsehood and by inciting you to incline towards the worldly life."
"Satan is certainly your enemy, so hold him as a foe. He only calls his faction to be the residents of Hell.",5,35,إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَٱتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوًّا إِنَّمَا يَدْعُوا۟ حِزْبَهُۥ لِيَكُونُوا۟ مِنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"O people, the satan is for you an enemy whose enmity is everlasting, so take him as an enemy by committing to fighting him. The satan only calls his followers towards disbelief in Allah so that their outcome is to enter the burning fire on the day of judgment."
"For those who are unbelievers, there is severe punishment; but for those who believe and do the right is forgiveness and a great reward.",6,35,ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,Those who disbelieved in Allah by following the satan will have a severe punishment. And those who believe in Allah and do good actions will have forgiveness from Allah for their sins and will have a great reward from Him which is Paradise.
"Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)? God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will. So do not waste away your self with grief for them. God is indeed cognisant of things they do.",7,35,أَفَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُۥ سُوٓءُ عَمَلِهِۦ فَرَءَاهُ حَسَنًا فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ فَلَا تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَٰتٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,"The one for whom the satan has beautified his bad actions and so he thinks them to be good is not like the one for whom Allah has beautified the truth and so he believes it to be the truth, because Allah leads astray whom He wants and guides whom He wants, without anyone to compel Him. So do not destroy yourself, O Messenger, out of grief over the misguidance of the misguided. Allah is Knowing of what they do. Nothing of their actions is hidden from Him."
"It is God who sends the winds that raise the clouds. Then We drive the clouds towards the land that was dead, and restore the earth to life after it had died. So will be the Resurrection.",8,35,وَٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَسُقْنَٰهُ إِلَىٰ بَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ فَأَحْيَيْنَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا كَذَٰلِكَ ٱلنُّشُورُ,"Allah is the one who sent the winds, then these winds move clouds, then I lead these clouds to a land in which there are no plants, then I give life through its water, causing plants to grow, after being dead and dry. So just as I gave life to this land after its death, through the plants I placed in it, the resurrection of the dead will happen on the day of judgment."
"Whosoever desires honour (should remember) that all honour is with God. All good words ascend to Him, and all good deeds He exalts. As for those who are plotting evil, there is severe punishment for them, and their plots will be fruitless.",9,35,مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْعِزَّةُ جَمِيعًا إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ ٱلْكَلِمُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ وَٱلْعَمَلُ ٱلصَّٰلِحُ يَرْفَعُهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَمْكُرُونَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَكْرُ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُوَ يَبُورُ,"Whoever wants honour in this world or in the Hereafter should only seek it from Allah, because for Allah alone is honour in both of them. His pleasant rememberance is elevated to Him, and the good deeds of His servants are raised to Him. And those who make evil schemes, such as trying to kill the Messenger (peace be upon him), will have a severe punishment. And the scheming of these disbelievers will perish and no objective of theirs will be realised."
"It is God who created you from dust, then from a sperm, then formed you into pairs. Neither does a female conceive nor gives birth without His knowledge; nor do the old grow older or become younger in years but in accordance with the law (of nature). Indeed the law of God works inevitably.",10,35,وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنثَىٰ وَلَا تَضَعُ إِلَّا بِعِلْمِهِۦ وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلَا يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِۦٓ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"Allah is the one who created your father Adam from soil, then He created you from a sperm-drop, then He made you men and women who marry one another. And no female conceives a foetus nor does she give birth except with His knowledge. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. And the lifespan of any of His creation is not increased nor is it decreased except that it is written in the Preserved Tablet. That which has been mentioned, namely creating you from soil, creating you in stages and writing your lifespans in the Preserved Tablet, is easy for Allah."
"Alike are not two bodies of water: This one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and this one brine and bitter; yet you get fresh meat to eat from both, and take out ornaments to wear. You see how the ships churn through them so that you may seek of His bounty and, perhaps, give thanks.",11,35,وَمَا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْبَحْرَانِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ سَآئِغٌ شَرَابُهُۥ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَمِن كُلٍّ تَأْكُلُونَ لَحْمًا طَرِيًّا وَتَسْتَخْرِجُونَ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلْفُلْكَ فِيهِ مَوَاخِرَ لِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"And the two seas are not alike: One of them is extremely sweet and easy to drink due to its sweetness, and the other is salty and bitter which is not drinkable due to its extreme saltiness. And from each of the abovementioned seas you eat fresh meat, which is fish, and you extract from them rubies and coral which you wear as adornment. And you see the ships, O onlooker, splitting the sea with its sailing, coming and going, so you can seek the grace of Allah through trade, and so that you thank Allah for His many favours He has done for you."
"He makes night run into day, the day run into night, and has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs to its determined course. This is God your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those you invoke apart from Him are not masters even of the film on a date-palm stone.",12,35,يُولِجُ ٱلَّيْلَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ,"Allah enters the night into the day so it becomes longer and He enters the day into night so it becomes longer. And He made the sun and the moon subservient, each one of them travels in its appointed orbit until a fixed time which only Allah knows, which is the day of judgment. He who fixes all of that and carries it out is Allah your Lord. To Him alone belongs the kingdom. And the idols you worship besides Him do not even possess the thin membrane over the datestone, so how do you worship them besides Me?"
"You pray to them, but they do not hear your call; and even if they heard you, they could not answer your prayer; and on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your having worshipped them. None can acquaint you (with the reality) as He who is informed of everything.",13,35,إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا۟ دُعَآءَكُمْ وَلَوْ سَمِعُوا۟ مَا ٱسْتَجَابُوا۟ لَكُمْ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يَكْفُرُونَ بِشِرْكِكُمْ وَلَا يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ,"If you call your gods, they cannot hear your call, because they are inanimate objects which have no life in them nor can they hear. And if they could hear your calling them, for argument’s sake, they could not respond to you. And on the day of judgment they will disassociate themselves from your idolatry and your worshipping them, so there is nobody who can inform you, O Messenger, more truthfully than Allah."
"O men, it is you who stand in need of God. As for God, He is above all need, worthy of praise.",14,35,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ أَنتُمُ ٱلْفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"O people, you are the ones in need of Allah in all your affairs and in all your conditions. And Allah is the Self-sufficient who does not need you for anything, the Praiseworthy in this world and the Hereafter for what He decrees for His servants."
He could take you away if He pleased and bring a new creation (in your place).,15,35,إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"If He wants to remove you by destroying you, He can remove you and bring a new creation in your place who will worship Him and not associate any partner with Him."
This is well within the power of God.,16,35,وَمَا ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,And removing you by destroying you and bringing a new creation in your place is not impossible for Allah.
"No one who carries a burden bears another's load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations. Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.",17,35,وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لَا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰٓ إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمَن تَزَكَّىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَتَزَكَّىٰ لِنَفْسِهِۦ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"And no soul will carry the sin of another, but rather every sinning soul will carry its own sin. And if a soul who has been burdened with carrying its sin, calls someone to carry some of its sins, nothing of its sins will be carried, even if the one who is being asked is a close relative. O Messenger, you can only warn of Allah’s punishment those who fear their Lord in private and complete the prayer in the most perfect way, for they are the ones who will take heed from your warning. whoever is purified from his sins, the greatest of them being polythiesm, then his purification will only benefit himself when he returns to his Lord, And Allah is not in any need for His slaves obedience. To Allah is the return on the day of judgment for the reckoning and recompense."
"Equal are not the blind and those who can see,",18,35,وَمَا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ,"The disbeliever and believer are not the same in status, just as the blind and seeing are not the same."
"Nor darkness and light,",19,35,وَلَا ٱلظُّلُمَٰتُ وَلَا ٱلنُّورُ,"And disbelief and faith are not the same, just as darkness and light are not the same."
Nor shade and heat of sunshine.,20,35,وَلَا ٱلظِّلُّ وَلَا ٱلْحَرُورُ,"And Paradise and the fire of hell are not the same in their effects, just as shade and hot winds are not the same."
Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.,21,35,وَمَا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْأَحْيَآءُ وَلَا ٱلْأَمْوَٰتُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسْمِعُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ,"And the believers and disbelievers are not the same, just as the living and the dead are not the same. Allah makes those whom He wants to guide hear. And you, O Messenger, cannot make the disbelievers who are like the dead in the graves hear."
You are only a bearer of warnings.,22,35,إِنْ أَنتَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ,You are not except a warner to them of Allah’s punishment.
"We have sent you with the truth, to give glad tidings and to warn. Never has there been a community to which an admonisher was not sent.",23,35,إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلَّا خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ,"O Messenger, I have sent you with the truth in which there is no doubt, to give good news to the believers of the generous reward He has prepared for them and to warn the disbelievers of the painful punishment He has prepared for them. And there is no nation from the previous nations except that there passed in them a messenger from Allah to warn them of His punishment."
"If they call you a liar, so had those before them called their apostles liars, who had come to them with clear proofs, scriptures and the splendent Book.",24,35,وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَبِٱلزُّبُرِ وَبِٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,"And if your people deny you, O Messenger, be patient, because you are not the first Messenger whose people denied him, as the nations before them denied their messengers, such as Aad, Thamud and the people of Lot. Their messengers came to them with clear evidences and overwhelming miracles which prove their truthfulness, and their messengers came to them with scrolls and with the Scripture which is enlightening for one who ponders over it and contemplates it."
So We seized the unbelievers. How great was the change I wrought in their condition then!,25,35,ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,"But despite that, they disbelieved in Allah and His messengers and they did not accept what they brought from Him, so I destroyed those who disbelieved. So think, O Messenger, how terrible my punishment was when I destroyed them."
"Do you not see how God sends water from the sky, then We produce fruits from it variegated in colour; and on mountains are tracts of red and white, in different shades and raven black.",26,35,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِۦ ثَمَرَٰتٍ مُّخْتَلِفًا أَلْوَٰنُهَا وَمِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ جُدَدٌۢ بِيضٌ وَحُمْرٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَٰنُهَا وَغَرَابِيبُ سُودٌ,"O Messenger, have you not seen that I sent rainwater from the sky, then I extracted fruits of different colours from that water, amongst them red, green, yellow and others, after I had watered their trees from it? And from the mountains are white tracts, red tracts and extremely black tracts."
"And so are among men, beasts and cattle, different shades. Only those of His creatures fear God who have knowledge. Verily He is all-mighty and forgiving.",27,35,وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱلدَّوَآبِّ وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَٰنُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْعُلَمَٰٓؤُا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ غَفُورٌ,"And amongst men, animals and cattle (camels, cows and sheep) are different colours like that which was mentioned. Only those who exalt Allah and have true fear of Him, are the knowledgable ones, because they recognise His attributes, His sacred law and the proof of His power. Allah is Mighty, no one can overpower Him. He forgives of the sins of His servants who repent."
"Surely those who read the Book of God, are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them in secret or openly, can hope for a commerce that will not decline,",28,35,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأَنفَقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً يَرْجُونَ تِجَٰرَةً لَّن تَبُورَ,"Those who read the Book of Allah which I revealed to My Messenger and practice what it contains, and complete the prayer in the best way, and who spend from what I have provided them, through Zakat and other ways, secretly and openly, seek through those actions a trade with Allah which is never profitless."
"So that He may reward them in full, and give them a greater increase by His grace. He is verily forgiving and rewarding.",29,35,لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"So that Allah can give them the full reward of their actions and increase them from His grace, as this is His domain. He is Forgiving of the sins of those who are described with these qualities and Appreciating of their good actions."
"What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, and proves (what has been sent) before it to be true. Verily God is informed of His creatures and sees everything.",30,35,وَٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِعِبَادِهِۦ لَخَبِيرٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"The scripture I have revealed to you, O Messenger, is the truth in which there is not doubt, it has been revealed by Allah affirming the precious scriptures. Allah is well informed about His servants and He sees everything. He therefore reveals to the Messenger of every nation what they need in their time."
"So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God's will, which is the greatest blessing.",31,35,ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌۢ بِٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"Then I gave the Qur’ān to the nation of Muhammad peace be with him whom I had chosen over other communities. Some of them wronged their own souls by doing prohibited acts and leaving out their obligations. Some were moderate by doing their obligations and leaving out prohibited acts, together with leaving out some recommended acts and doing some disliked acts. Some, by Allah’s leave, were foremost in good deeds, by doing their obligations and recommended acts and leaving out prohibited and disliked acts. The abovementioned - selection of this nation and its being given the Qur’ān - is the greatest favour to which no favour can come close."
"They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments.",32,35,جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤًا وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ,"Gardens of residence, which will be entered by these chosen ones. In it they will wear bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be silk."
"They will say: ""All praise be to God who has removed all care from us. Indeed our Lord is forgiving and rewarding,",33,35,وَقَالُوا۟ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا ٱلْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"They will say after they enter Paradise: Praise be to Allah, Who has removed from us all grief on account of the fear that we had of entering the fire. Our Lord is truly forgiving of the sins of those servants of His who repent, and He is appreciative for their following Him."
"Who has settled us by His grace in the mansions of eternal rest, where there is no labour for us, nor does weariness come upon us.""",34,35,ٱلَّذِىٓ أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ ٱلْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ لَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ,"The One who has settled us in the Everlasting Home - out of His bounty, not by our might or strength, where no toil or fatigue will touch us."
"As for the unbelievers, there is the fire of Hell. It will neither consume them wholly that they should die, nor will its torment be lessened for them. That is how We requite the ungrateful.",35,35,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَهُمْ نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ لَا يُقْضَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُوا۟ وَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُم مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى كُلَّ كَفُورٍ,"For those who deny Allah will be the fire of Hell, in which they will remain forever. Neither will the decision of death be passed for them, so they can die and be relieved from the punishment, nor will the punishment of Hell be alleviated for them in any way. Similar to this recompense, I will reward every person who denies the favours of His Lord on the Day of Judgement."
"There they will cry for help: ""O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do."" Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you? So now taste (the punishment). The iniquitous will have none to help them.",36,35,وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَٰلِحًا غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُم مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ ٱلنَّذِيرُ فَذُوقُوا۟ فَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ,"They will cry out therein as loud as they can, seeking help by saying: Our Lord! Let us out from the fire, and we will do righteous deeds, different to what we did before so that we can attain Your pleasure and be saved from Your punishment. Allah will respond to them thus: Did I not let you live a life long enough so that anyone who wanted to take heed could do so and do righteous deeds; and the Messenger came to you to warn you of Allah’s punishment? Thus you have no argument nor any excuse after all of this, so taste the punishment of the fire. Those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins will have no helper to rescue them from Allah’s punishment or lighten it for them."
Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth. Indeed He knows what lies in the hearts of men.,37,35,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَٰلِمُ غَيْبِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Allah knows all that is hidden in the heavens and earth. Nothing of that misses Him. He knows whatever His servants conceal in their chests, whether good or bad."
"He is the one who made you trustees on the earth. So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss.",38,35,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَٰٓئِفَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَمَن كَفَرَ فَعَلَيْهِ كُفْرُهُۥ وَلَا يَزِيدُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا مَقْتًا وَلَا يَزِيدُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ إِلَّا خَسَارًا,"It is He who made some of you, O people, succeed others on earth. Those who deny Allah and what the messengers brought, then the sin and retribution of their disbelief will be borne by them. Their disbelief does not harm their Lord. The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to their Lord’s displeasure and hatred for them. The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to their loss, as they will lose what Allah would have prepared for them in Paradise had they believed."
"Say: ""Look at the compeers you invoke apart from God. Show me, what of the earth have they created, or what share have they in the heavens?"" Or have We given them a Book whose testimony they possess? Not in the least. What the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit.",39,35,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ شُرَكَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ كِتَٰبًا فَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَتٍ مِّنْهُ بَلْ إِن يَعِدُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا إِلَّا غُرُورًا,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: Tell me about those partners of yours that you worship instead of Allah, what have they created on earth. Did they create its mountains? Did they create its rivers? Did they create its animals? Or do they have any share with Allah in the creation of the heavens? Or have I given them a book in which there is proof of the validity of their worshipping their idols? Nothing of that is true. In fact, those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins promise one another nothing but delusion."
"Verily God holds the heavens and the earth in position lest they deviate; and if they deviated there will be none to hold them in place, apart from Him He is sagacious and forgiving.",40,35,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا وَلَئِن زَالَتَآ إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا,"Allah, (may He be glorified), holds the heavens and the earth preventing them from vanishing and were they to vanish, hypothetically, there is none to hold them back from vanishing after Him, (may He be glorified). He is Forbearing, and does not rush to punish, Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent."
"The unbelievers swore on oath emphatically that if an admonisher came to them they would be guided better than the other communities. But when the admonisher came to them their aversion for the truth increased,",41,35,وَأَقْسَمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْ إِحْدَى ٱلْأُمَمِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ مَّا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا,"These denying disbelievers swore a solemn and affirmed oath that if a messenger from Allah came to them to warn them of His punishment, they would be more guided and follow the truth more than the Jews, Christians and others. Yet when Muhammad (peace be upon him) came to them after being sent by His Lord, and he warned them of Allah’s punishment, his coming only increased them in aversion to the truth and adherence to falsehood. They did not fulfil the solemn oaths that they took that they will be more guided than those who preceded them."
"As did their arrogance in the land, and their plotting of evil. But their evil plots will turn back on the plotters themselves. So can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people? You will not find any change in the law of God, nor will you find divine law mutable.",42,35,ٱسْتِكْبَارًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَكْرَ ٱلسَّيِّئِ وَلَا يَحِيقُ ٱلْمَكْرُ ٱلسَّيِّئُ إِلَّا بِأَهْلِهِۦ فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا سُنَّتَ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ فَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًا وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ ٱللَّهِ تَحْوِيلًا,"The oaths that they took in Allah’s name was not done in good faith and with a sound objective. It was only to be arrogant on earth and to deceive people. An evil plot only rebounds on those who plotted it. So are these arrogant plotters waiting for anything but Allah’s established practice, which is their destruction as He had destroyed those predecessors of theirs who were similar to them. You will not find any change to Allah’s practice in destroying those who are arrogant, such that the destruction does not come on them, nor any diversion such that it falls on others besides them, because it is an established divine practice."
"Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them, who were far more powerful, came about? There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat (the law of) God. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.",43,35,أَوَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَكَانُوٓا۟ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعْجِزَهُۥ مِن شَىْءٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ عَلِيمًا قَدِيرًا,"Have these deniers not travelled on earth and reflected over how those nations before them who had denied met their end? Was their end not an evil one as Allah destroyed them, although they were superior to these people in strength? Allah is not to be outdone by anything in the heavens or on earth. He is the One who knows about the actions of these deniers - nothing of their actions is hidden from nor escapes Him. He has power to destroy them whenever He wills."
"If God were to seize men for their doings, not a living being would be left upon the earth. But He gives them respite for a time ordained. When their time is come, surely God will keep (the interest of) His creatures in view.",44,35,وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُوا۟ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَىٰ ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِۦ بَصِيرًۢا,"If Allah were to rush to punish people for the wrong they have done and the sins they perpetrated, He would have destroyed all the people on earth at once, together with the animals and wealth they own. But, He, (may He be glorified), gives them respite until a fixed time, which is the day of resurrection. When the day of resurrection comes, Allah is fully aware of what His servants used to do, and nothing remains hidden from Him. He will then recompense them for their actions, whether good or bad."
YA SIN.,0,36,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يسٓ,Ya Sin. The discussion on similar letters has already passed at the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"I call to witness the Qur'an, custodian of all laws, --",1,36,وَٱلْقُرْءَانِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"Allah takes an oath by the Qur’ān, whose verses have been perfectly constructed, and to which no falsehood comes neither from in front of nor behind it."
That you are indeed one of those sent,2,36,إِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"You, O Messenger, are on the messengers whom Allah sent to His servants, to instruct them to declare His Oneness and to worship Him alone."
"On a path that is straight, --",3,36,عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"This straight approach and upright law is revealed from your Lord, the Mighty, whom no one can challenge, and the Merciful to His servants who have faith."
"A revelation from the mighty, ever-merciful (God),",4,36,تَنزِيلَ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,"This straight approach and upright law is revealed from your Lord, the Mighty, whom no one can challenge, and the Merciful to His servants who have faith."
"That you may warn a people whose ancestors had never been warned, who are therefore heedless.",5,36,لِتُنذِرَ قَوْمًا مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَٰفِلُونَ,"I revealed it to you to warn and exhort a nation, the Arabs to whom no Messenger has come to warn them and as a result they are heedless of faith and monotheism. Likewise is the case of every nation which has been away from the exhortation, they need messengers, scholars and preachers to remind them."
"The sentence is surely justified against most of them, for they do not believe.",6,36,لَقَدْ حَقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَىٰٓ أَكْثَرِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The punishment from Allah has become binding on most of these people, after the truth from Allah on the tongue of His Messenger reached them but they did not believe in it and remained on their disbelief. They do not have faith in Allah and nor His Messenger and they do not act on the truth that came to them."
"We will certainly put iron collars on their heel's which will come up to their chins, so that they will not be able to raise their heads.",7,36,إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا فِىٓ أَعْنَٰقِهِمْ أَغْلَٰلًا فَهِىَ إِلَى ٱلْأَذْقَانِ فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ,"These people do not have faith nor are they guided. Their example in this is like those in whose necks iron collars that extend all the way up and whose hands are tied to their necks under their chins. As a result, they are forced to lift their heads to the sky and they are unable to lower them. These people are shackled from having faith in Allah and therefore they do not submit to it and they do not lower their heads on account of it."
"And We shall raise a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and cover them over so that they will not be able to see.",8,36,وَجَعَلْنَا مِنۢ بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ سَدًّا وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ سَدًّا فَأَغْشَيْنَٰهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ,I placed before them a barrier to the truth and behind them another barrier. I covered their eyes from the truth so they cannot see in a manner that is of benefit to them. This happened to them after their stubborness and persistence in disbelief became apparent.
"Whether you warn them or do not warn, it is all the same; they will not believe.",9,36,وَسَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"It is all the same to these disbelievers who oppose the truth, whether you, O Muhammad, warn them or you do not warn them. They will not accept what you have brought from Allah."
You can only warn him who listens to the warning and fears Ar-Rahman secretly. So give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward.,10,36,إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَخَشِىَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ فَبَشِّرْهُ بِمَغْفِرَةٍ وَأَجْرٍ كَرِيمٍ,"The person who really benefits from your warning is the one who accepts this Qur’ān and follows what is contained in it, and who fears His Lord in solitude where nobody else sees him. So tell those who have these attributes the pleasing news of Allah’s wiping out their sins and HForgiving them and of a great reward awaiting them in the Hereafter, which is entry into Paradise."
"It is We indeed who bring back the dead to life, and write down what they send ahead (of their deeds), and traces that they leave behind. We keep an account of all things in a lucid register.",11,36,إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَدَّمُوا۟ وَءَاثَٰرَهُمْ وَكُلَّ شَىْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَٰهُ فِىٓ إِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ,"I shall bring the dead back to life by resurrecting them to give account on the day of resurrection. we record the good and the bad deeds that they send forth in this life to be rewarded for in the next, and we also record the good and bad aftereffects from their actions, such as the good that comes out of charity after they pass away and the evils that result of their misdeeds. We have counted everything, and recorded it in a clear book, which is the preserved tablet."
Narrate to them the example of the people of the city when the messengers came to it.,12,36,وَٱضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلًا أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ إِذْ جَآءَهَا ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,"Give, O Messenger, these stubborn deniers an example that will be a lesson for them, which is the story of the people of the town when their messengers came to them."
"When We sent two of them they called them liars; so We sent a third to strengthen them. ""We have been sent to you,"" they said.",13,36,إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ ٱثْنَيْنِ فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَعَزَّزْنَا بِثَالِثٍ فَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُم مُّرْسَلُونَ,"When I sent to them at first two messengers to call them to Allah’s Oneness and His worship. But they rejected these two messengers. Then we sent as reinforcement for these two a third Messenger with them. The three messengers said to the people of the town: We - all three of us - have been sent to you, to call you to Allah’s Oneness and to follow His law."
"""You are only men like us,"" they replied; ""Ar-Rahman has not sent down any thing. You are speaking only lies.""",14,36,قَالُوا۟ مَآ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا تَكْذِبُونَ,The people of the town said to those who were sent: You are only men like us. You do not have any special status over us. The Merciful has not sent down any revelation to you. You are only lying about Allah in this claim of yours.
"(The messengers) said: ""Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you.",15,36,قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا يَعْلَمُ إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمُرْسَلُونَ,"The three messengers said in response to the denial by the people of the town: Our Lord knows that we have been sent by Him to you, O people of the town! That is enough evidence for us."
"Our duty is to convey the message clearly.""",16,36,وَمَا عَلَيْنَآ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,Our duty is only to clearly convey what we have been instructed to convey to you. We have no control over your guidance.
"They rejoined: ""We feel you augur ill. If you do not desist, we shall stone you to death, and inflict a grievous punishment on you.""",17,36,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا تَطَيَّرْنَا بِكُمْ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهُوا۟ لَنَرْجُمَنَّكُمْ وَلَيَمَسَّنَّكُم مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"The people of the town said to the messengers: We see an evil omen in you. If you do not stop calling us to monotheism, we will punish you by stoning to death and you will receive a painful punishment from us."
"(The messengers) said: ""The augury is within your own selves. Do you (consider it a bad omen) that you should be warned? You are a people guilty of excess.""",18,36,قَالُوا۟ طَٰٓئِرُكُم مَّعَكُمْ أَئِن ذُكِّرْتُم بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ,"The messengers said in response to them: Your evil omen is within yourselves on account of your denial of Allah and your leaving out following His messengers. Do you see an evil omen if we reminded you of Allah! In fact, you are a people who have gone too far in the perpetration of disbelief and sins."
"Then a man came running from the other side of the city. ""O my people,"" he said, ""follow the messengers.",19,36,وَجَآءَ مِنْ أَقْصَا ٱلْمَدِينَةِ رَجُلٌ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,From a far part of the town a man came running fearing his people’s denial of the messengers and their threatening to kill or harm them. He said: O my people! Follow what these messengers have brought.
"Follow those who do not ask for any recompense of you, and are rightly guided.",20,36,ٱتَّبِعُوا۟ مَن لَّا يَسْـَٔلُكُمْ أَجْرًا وَهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,O people! Follow those who do not ask you for any reward for conveying what they brought and they are rightly guided in the revelation of Allah that they convey to you. A person like this deserves to be followed.
"Why should I not worship Him who brought me into being, to whom you will be brought back in the end?",21,36,وَمَا لِىَ لَآ أَعْبُدُ ٱلَّذِى فَطَرَنِى وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"This well-wishing man said: What prevents me from worshipping Allah Who created me? What prevents you from worshipping your Lord Who created you, and to Him alone you will return when you are resurrected for the recompense?"
"Should I take other gods apart from Him, who would neither be able to intercede for me nor save me if Ar-Rahman brings me harm?",22,36,ءَأَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةً إِن يُرِدْنِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ بِضُرٍّ لَّا تُغْنِ عَنِّى شَفَٰعَتُهُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يُنقِذُونِ,"Shall I take other deities to be wrongly worshipped instead of Allah Who created me? If the Merciful intends harm for me, the intercession of these other deities will not avail me at all, nor will they be able to save me from the harm that Allah intended for me if I die as a disbeliever."
In that case I would surely be in clear error.,23,36,إِنِّىٓ إِذًا لَّفِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,If I have to take them as deities besides Allah I would be in clear error as I would have worshipped a being that is not deserving of worship and I would have omitted worshipping the Being Who is deserving thereof.
"I believe in your Lord, so listen to me.""",24,36,إِنِّىٓ ءَامَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَٱسْمَعُونِ,"O my people, I have accepted both my and your Lord, so listen to me. I do not care about the threats of murder that you make. But his people insisted on killing him and Allah entered him into Paradise."
"(But they stoned him to death.) It was said to him: ""Enter Paradise;"" and he said: ""If only my people knew",25,36,قِيلَ ٱدْخُلِ ٱلْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَٰلَيْتَ قَوْمِى يَعْلَمُونَ,"It was said in honour of this man after his people killed him: Enter Paradise after you are killed as a martyr. When he entered it and saw the delight therein, he said longingly: If only my people who denied and killed me knew about the forgiveness of sins that I obtained and what my Lord has honoured me with, they would have believed like how I believed and they would have attained a reward similar to mine."
"How my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of those who are honoured!""",26,36,بِمَا غَفَرَ لِى رَبِّى وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ ٱلْمُكْرَمِينَ,"It was said in honour of this man after his people killed him: Enter Paradise after you are killed as a martyr. When he entered it and saw the delight therein, he said longingly: If only my people who denied and killed me knew about the forgiveness of sins that I obtained and what my Lord has honoured me with, they would have believed like how I believed and they would have attained a reward similar to mine."
"We did not send down any army against his people from heaven, nor did We have to send one.",27,36,وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ مِن جُندٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا كُنَّا مُنزِلِينَ,"In order to destroy his people who had denied and killed him, I did not need an army of angels to be sent down from the sky. Their matter was much easier than that for Me. I had decreed that their destruction will be by a blast from the sky and not by sending down the angels of punishment."
"There was just one blast, and they were extinguished.",28,36,إِن كَانَتْ إِلَّا صَيْحَةً وَٰحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ خَٰمِدُونَ,"Thus the incident of the destruction of his people was simply one blast which we sent upon them and they fell down with nothing remaining. Their example is like that of a fire that was burning and then was extinguished, leaving behind no trace."
Alas for men! No apostle ever came to them but they made fun of him.,29,36,يَٰحَسْرَةً عَلَى ٱلْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"Alas for those servants who denied, and how regretful will their situation be on the day of resurrection when they will see the punishment. That is because in the world, whenever any Messenger from Allah came to them, they used to mock at and ridicule him. Their outcome will therefore be regret on the day of resurrection for the neglect of their duty to Allah."
Have they not seen how many generations have We destroyed before them who will not return again?,30,36,أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ,Did these people who deny and ridicule the messengers not see a lesson in those nations who preceded them? They passed away and did not return to the world a second time. Rather they met the actions they had sent ahead and Allah will recompense them for that.
They will all be brought together before Us.,31,36,وَإِن كُلٌّ لَّمَّا جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ,"All nations, without exception, will be brought before Me on the Day of Resurrection after they are resurrected for Me to give them the recompense for their actions."
"There is a sign in the dead earth for them which We quicken, and produce from it grain which they eat.",32,36,وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ ٱلْأَرْضُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ أَحْيَيْنَٰهَا وَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهَا حَبًّا فَمِنْهُ يَأْكُلُونَ,"A sign for those who deny the resurrection that the resurrection is true is this dry and barren land, on which I sent down rain from the sky and I grew therein various types of plants and produced various kinds of grains for people to eat. The One Who gave life to this earth by sending down the rain and bringing out the plants, is able to give life to and resurrect the dead."
"We have laid out gardens of dates and grapes upon it, and made springs of water flow,",33,36,وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا جَنَّٰتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَٰبٍ وَفَجَّرْنَا فِيهَا مِنَ ٱلْعُيُونِ,"We have placed in this earth, on which I sent down rain, gardens of date palms and grapes; and I caused springs of water to gush forth to irrigate them."
So that they may eat of its fruit; yet it was not done by their hands. Then why do they not acknowledge thanks?,34,36,لِيَأْكُلُوا۟ مِن ثَمَرِهِۦ وَمَا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَفَلَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"So that people can eat of the fruits of those gardens that Allah has blessed them with and for which they did not make any effort. Do they not thank Allah, Who gave them all of that out of His bounty and mercy for them, by worshipping Him alone and having faith in His messengers?!"
"All glory to Him who created pairs of everything that grows from the earth, and out of themselves, and other things they do not know.",35,36,سُبْحَٰنَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْأَزْوَٰجَ كُلَّهَا مِمَّا تُنۢبِتُ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Glory be to Allah Who created the various types of plants and trees, and of the souls of people, as He created males and females, and other creations of Allah that people do not know of on land, sea and other places."
"And there is a sign in the night for them. We strip off the day from it and they are left in darkness,",36,36,وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ ٱلَّيْلُ نَسْلَخُ مِنْهُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فَإِذَا هُم مُّظْلِمُونَ,"An indication for people of Allah’s Oneness is that I take away the daylight as the day draws to an end, bringing the night, as the day withdraws from it, until the people are in complete darkness."
"While the sun keeps revolving in its orbit. This is the dispensation of the mighty, all-knowing (God).",37,36,وَٱلشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,"A sign for them of Allah’s Oneness is this sun that runs to a point that Allah knows and does not go beyond that. That determination is the determination of the Mighty, who is not challenged by anyone, the Knower from Whom nothing of His creation is hidden."
"We have determined the stations of the moon, so that (after its wanderings) it returns as a dried up inflorescent spike of dates.",38,36,وَٱلْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَٰهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّىٰ عَادَ كَٱلْعُرْجُونِ ٱلْقَدِيمِ,"A sign for them indicating His Oneness, (may He be glorified), is this moon for which I have determined phases each night. It begins small then becomes big and then small again until it becomes similar to a twisted, old date stalk, in it appearing as thin, curved, yellow and old."
"Neither can the sun overtake the moon, nor the night outpace the day: Each of them keeps coursing in its orbit.",39,36,لَا ٱلشَّمْسُ يَنۢبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تُدْرِكَ ٱلْقَمَرَ وَلَا ٱلَّيْلُ سَابِقُ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ,"These signs; the sun moon, night and day, each are predetermined by Allah's divine arrangement/determination and do not surpass what has been determined for them. The sun cannot catch up with the moon to change its course or take away its light, and nor can the night outpace the day and enter upon it before its time ends. All these creations, subservient or not, such as stars and galaxies, have their own courses as per Allah’s determination and protection."
That We bore their progeny in the laden ark is a sign for them;,40,36,وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِى ٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلْمَشْحُونِ,Another sign for them of Allah’s Oneness and of His favour to His servants is that I carried those who were saved from the flood from the progeny of Adam in the time of Noah in the ship that was filled with Allah’s creations. Allah carried therein a pair of every species.
And We made similar vessels for them to ride.,41,36,وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِّن مِّثْلِهِۦ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ,"A sign for them of Allah’s Oneness and His favour to His servants is that I created for them, like the ship of Noah, conveyances and some types of animals on which they can travel long distances."
"We could have drowned them if We pleased, and none would have answered their cry for help, nor would they have been saved,",42,36,وَإِن نَّشَأْ نُغْرِقْهُمْ فَلَا صَرِيخَ لَهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يُنقَذُونَ,If I wished to drown them I would have done so. There would be no one to help them if I wished to drown them and there would be no one to rescue them if they drowned by My command and decree.
"Unless by Our benevolence, to reap advantage for a time.",43,36,إِلَّا رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَمَتَٰعًا إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Except if I have mercy on them by rescuing them from drowning and restoring them to enjoy until a specified time that they will not go beyond, so that they take a lesson and have faith."
"When it is said to them: ""Beware of what is before you and what is past, that you may be treated with kindness;""",44,36,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَمَا خَلْفَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"When these idolaters who turn away from faith are told: Beware of what you are going towards in the Hereafter and its difficulties, and beware of the world behind you, in the hope that Allah will favour you with His mercy, they do not comply with that but they turn away from it without any care."
None of the signs of their Lord ever comes to them but they turn away from it.,45,36,وَمَا تَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ مِّنْ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ,"Whenever Allah’s signs indicating to His Oneness and His being deserving of being worshipped alone came to these idolaters, they used to turn away from it without taking heed."
"When they are told: ""Spend of what God has given you,"" the unbelievers say to those who believe: ""Why should we feed those whom God should have fed if He pleased?"" You are only in palpable error.",46,36,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَنُطْعِمُ مَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ أَطْعَمَهُۥٓ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"When these stubborn ones are told: Assist the poor and the needy with the wealth that Allah has provided you with, they disapprovingly reply saying to those who have faith: Shall we feed those whom Allah could feed if He wanted to?! So we do not go against His will. You, O believers, are simply in clearly error and far off from the truth."
"And they say: ""When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?""",47,36,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"The disbelievers who deny the resurrection say in denial of it and regarding it as far-fetched: When is this resurrection if you, O believers, are true in your claim that it is to occur?"
"They are only waiting for a single blast that will seize them, but they will go on contending.",48,36,مَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا صَيْحَةً وَٰحِدَةً تَأْخُذُهُمْ وَهُمْ يَخِصِّمُونَ,"But all these deniers of resurrection who regard it as far-fetched are waiting for is the first blast when it is blown into the trumpet, which will suddenly overtake them while they are in their worldly concerns of buying, selling, irrigating and herding and other worldly concerns."
"Then they would not be able to make a will, or go back to their people.",49,36,فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ تَوْصِيَةً وَلَآ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"When this blast surprises them they will not be able to make a bequest for one another, and they will not be able to return to their homes and families. Instead, they will die whilst they are in these worldly concerns of theirs."
"When the trumpet blast is sounded they will come out of their graves and hasten to their Lord,",50,36,وَنُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَإِذَا هُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَجْدَاثِ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَنسِلُونَ,"The trumpet will be blown a second time for the resurrection, and suddenly they will all come out of their graves rushing towards their Lord for the reckoning and recompense."
"Saying: ""Ah woe, who has roused us from our sleep?"" This is what Ar-Rahman had promised, and whose truth the apostles had affirmed.",51,36,قَالُوا۟ يَٰوَيْلَنَا مَنۢ بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا هَٰذَا مَا وَعَدَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ وَصَدَقَ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,These disbelievers who deny the resurrection will say in regret: What loss is ours! Who is it that has raised us from our grave? They will be given a response to their question: This is what Allah promised and will definitely occur. The messengers spoke the truth in the message of their Lord that they conveyed in this regard.
"It would be but a single blast of the trumpet, and they would all be arraigned before Us.",52,36,إِن كَانَتْ إِلَّا صَيْحَةً وَٰحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ,The matter of resurrection from the graves will only be an effect of a second blowing of the trumpet and all created things will be presented before us on the Day of Resurrection to give account.
"No soul will be wronged the least that Day, nor would be recompensed but only for what it had done.",53,36,فَٱلْيَوْمَ لَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Judgement will be passed with fairness on that day and you, O servants, will not be wronged in the least by an increase of your bad deeds or a reduction in your good deeds. You will simply be given the full recompense for what you used to do in the worldly life."
Surely the inmates of Paradise will be engaged in pastimes.,54,36,إِنَّ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلْيَوْمَ فِى شُغُلٍ فَٰكِهُونَ,"The people of Paradise on this day, which is the day of resurrection, will be preoccupied from thinking about others, because of the permanent bliss and supreme success they will see. They will be enjoying that happily."
They and their companions will recline on couches in the shade.,55,36,هُمْ وَأَزْوَٰجُهُمْ فِى ظِلَٰلٍ عَلَى ٱلْأَرَآئِكِ مُتَّكِـُٔونَ,They and their spouses will be comfortably sitting on couches under lush shades in Paradise.
For them will be fruits and whatever they ask.,56,36,لَهُمْ فِيهَا فَٰكِهَةٌ وَلَهُم مَّا يَدَّعُونَ,"In this Paradise they will have various types of wholesome fruits such as grapes, figs and pomegranates and they will have any type of delight or bliss that they ask for. Whatever they ask for they will get."
"""Peace"" shall be the greeting from the merciful Lord.",57,36,سَلَٰمٌ قَوْلًا مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ,"Over and above this bliss they will have peace that they will get, as a statement from a Lord Who is merciful to them. When He will greet them with peace they will attain peace and safety from all sides and they will obtain the greeting that no other greeting can surpass."
"(And the guilty will be told:) ""O sinners, separate yourselves this day.",58,36,وَٱمْتَٰزُوا۟ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَيُّهَا ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,The idolaters will be told on the day of resurrection: Step aside from the believers. It is not appropriate for them to be with you because of the disparity in your recompense and theirs and in your attributes and theirs.
"Did I not commit you, O children of Adam, not to worship Satan who is your acknowledged foe,",59,36,أَلَمْ أَعْهَدْ إِلَيْكُمْ يَٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ أَن لَّا تَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,Did I not advise and instruct you on the tongues of My messengers and say to you: O children of Adam! Do not follow Satan by committing various types of disbelief and sins. Satan is a clear enemy to you. How can any sensible person follow an enemy of his who has made his enmity clear!
But to serve Me; (that) this is the straight path?,60,36,وَأَنِ ٱعْبُدُونِى هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"I instructed you, O children of Adam, to worship Me alone and not to associate anything as partners to me. Worshipping Me alone and following Me is a straight path that leads to My pleasure and entry into Paradise. But you did not comply with my advice and instruction in that regard."
But he beguiled a great many of you. Why did you not then understand?,61,36,وَلَقَدْ أَضَلَّ مِنكُمْ جِبِلًّا كَثِيرًا أَفَلَمْ تَكُونُوا۟ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Satan has misled many of you. Did you not have intellects which you could use, and with sound reasoning it would have lead you to obey your Lord and worship only Him (may He be glorified)? And your intellects should have been enough as a safeguard from you following Satan who is your clear enemy."
This is the Hell that you were promised.,62,36,هَٰذِهِۦ جَهَنَّمُ ٱلَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,"This is Hell, which you were warned against in the world for your disbelief. It was a matter of the Ghaib to you, but today here you can witness it with your own eyes."
"Roast in it now for having disbelieved.""",63,36,ٱصْلَوْهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,Enter it today and suffer from its heat remaining therein forever on account of your rejection of Allah in your worldly life.
"We shall seal their lips that day; and their hands will speak, their feet testify to what they had done.",64,36,ٱلْيَوْمَ نَخْتِمُ عَلَىٰٓ أَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَتُكَلِّمُنَآ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَتَشْهَدُ أَرْجُلُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Today, I will seal their mouths and they will become mute not able to deny the disbelief and sins they committed. Their hands will speak to us about what they did in the world. Their feet will testify about the sins they perpetrated and walked towards."
We could take away their sight if We pleased; then they would run around to find the way: But how then would they see?,65,36,وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَطَمَسْنَا عَلَىٰٓ أَعْيُنِهِمْ فَٱسْتَبَقُوا۟ ٱلصِّرَٰطَ فَأَنَّىٰ يُبْصِرُونَ,"If I had willed to take away their sight I would have done so and they will not be able to see, just as I sealed their mouths and they were not able to speak. They would have then rushed towards the path to cross over it into Paradise, but it is unlikely that they will cross over when their sight is gone."
"And if We pleased We could paralyse them in their tracks, and they would not be able to move forward or turn back.",66,36,وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَمَسَخْنَٰهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِهِمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَطَٰعُوا۟ مُضِيًّا وَلَا يَرْجِعُونَ,"If I had willed to alter their form and make them sit on their feet I would have altered their form and made them sit on their feet, and they will not be able to move from their place nor will they be able to move forward nor backward."
"Whoever reaches old age, We reverse in natural disposition. Do they not have sense (to see)?",67,36,وَمَن نُّعَمِّرْهُ نُنَكِّسْهُ فِى ٱلْخَلْقِ أَفَلَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"Whoever’s life I extend by lengthening his lifespan, I return him to the stage of weakness. Do they not think with their intellect and understand that this abode is not one of permanence and immortality and that the everlasting abode is that of the Hereafter!"
"We have not taught (Muhammad) to versify, nor is it worthy of him. This is nothing but a reminder and illuminating discourse,",68,36,وَمَا عَلَّمْنَٰهُ ٱلشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنۢبَغِى لَهُۥٓ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,"I did not teach Muhammad (peace be upon him) poetry and nor is that appropriate for him, because it is not his nature and his disposition does not demand it so that you can claim that he is a poet. What I have taught him is only a admonition and a clear Qur’ān for those who ponder over it. It is not poetry."
"So that he may warn him who is alive and feels, and justify the word against those who do not believe.",69,36,لِّيُنذِرَ مَن كَانَ حَيًّا وَيَحِقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"To warn whose hearts are alive and they still have insight, for they are the ones who will benefit from it, And to establish the punishment against the disbelievers by making our signs manifest to them leaving them with no excuse."
"Do they not see the cattle among things We have fashioned by Our power, which they own,",70,36,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِّمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعَٰمًا فَهُمْ لَهَا مَٰلِكُونَ,"Have they not seen that I have created livestock for them, and they control the affairs of that livestock by doing with it whatever they require?"
Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat?,71,36,وَذَلَّلْنَٰهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ,"I have made the livestock serviceable for them and made it submissive to them; they ride on the backs of some and transport their loads, and they also consume some of its meat."
"And they derive other advantages and drinks from them. Even then they do not offer thanks,",72,36,وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مَنَٰفِعُ وَمَشَارِبُ أَفَلَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"They also have benefits in the livestock other than just riding and consuming its meat i.e. its wool, bristles, fur and value, which they use to make spreads and clothing. They can also drink of its milk. So, will they not show gratitude to Allah who has blessed them with these favours, and others?"
And take other gods apart from God that they may perhaps give them help.,73,36,وَٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"The idolaters have taken other deities instead of Allah whom they worship, hoping that they will help them and save them from the punishment of Allah."
They will not be able to help them and will be brought (to Us) as their levied troops.,74,36,لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مُّحْضَرُونَ,"Those deities that they have taken are not able to help themselves, let alone help whoever worships them instead of Allah. The worshippers, together with their idols, will all be brought to the punishment but will all protest innocence from one another."
So be not grieved by what they say. We certainly know what they hide and disclose.,75,36,فَلَا يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّا نَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,"O Messenger! Do not let their statements grieve you: that you have not been sent as a messenger, or that you are a poet, and other slander they fire towards you. Indeed, I know what they say privately and publicly, nothing is hidden from Me and I will requite them for it."
"Does not man see We created him from a drop of semen? Even then he becomes an open contender,",76,36,أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَٰهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Does the human who rejects the resurrection after death not ponder that I created him from semen, then he went through different phases until he was born and developed, turning into an argumentative and quarrelling creation? Does he not ponder over that to conclude that resurrection is possible?"
"And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: ""Who can put life into decayed bones?""",77,36,وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلًا وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُۥ قَالَ مَن يُحْىِ ٱلْعِظَٰمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ,"This disbeliever is heedless and ignorant when he uses decayed bones to prove the impossibility of resurrection, saying, “Who will resurrect us?” whilst having forgotten his own creation from non-existence."
"Say: ""He who created you the first time. He has knowledge of every creation,",78,36,قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ,"O Muhammad! Say to him in reply: “Whoever created these bones in the first place will bring them back to life, because the one who created them initially is not incapable of returning life to them; He (may He be glorified) is the knower of everything, nothing is hidden from Him.”"
"Who gave you fire from a green tree, with which you ignite the flame.""",79,36,ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلشَّجَرِ ٱلْأَخْضَرِ نَارًا فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْهُ تُوقِدُونَ,"The being who has made for you, O people, lush green trees from which you are able to extract fire by igniting them. So the being who combined two opposites: the moisture of the green trees and the fire ignited from them, is also capable of reviving the dead."
How can He who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them? Why not? He is the real creator all-knowing.,80,36,أَوَلَيْسَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِقَٰدِرٍ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ ٱلْخَلَّٰقُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Is not the one who created the heavens and the earth despite their grandeur, also capable of bringing the dead back to life, after causing their death? Of course! He is definitely capable of it; He is the creator who created all creations and He knows them all, so nothing is hidden from Him."
"When He wills a thing He has only to say: ""Be,"" and it is.",81,36,إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُۥٓ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْـًٔا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"The authority and prestige of Allah is such that when He intends to create something, all He says to it is “Be!” and so it happens as He intends it. His intending to give life, cause death, and resurrect is also like that."
"So all glory to Him who holds all power over everything, to whom you will go back in the end.",82,36,فَسُبْحَٰنَ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِۦ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"So Allah is glorified and free of the incapability the idolators ascribe to Him. He is the one to whom belongs total authority over everything and He does as He wishes with it; the keys to everything are in His Hands and you shall all return to Him in the Hereafter, where He will requite you over your deeds."
"I CALL TO witness those who stand arrayed in rows,",0,37,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلصَّٰٓفَّٰتِ صَفًّا,I take an oath on the angels who form compact rows in their worship.
"And those who restrain by reprimanding,",1,37,فَٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ زَجْرًا,And I also take an oath on the angels who drive the rainclouds and send them to wherever I command they send rain.
"And those who recite the Reminder,",2,37,فَٱلتَّٰلِيَٰتِ ذِكْرًا,And I take an oath in the angels who recite the Qur’ān.
"Verily your God is One,",3,37,إِنَّ إِلَٰهَكُمْ لَوَٰحِدٌ,"O people! Indeed, your true deity is one and has no partner: He is Allah."
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and the Lord of the Easts.",4,37,رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَرَبُّ ٱلْمَشَٰرِقِ,"The lord of the heavens; the lord of the earth; the lord of what is between the two, and the lord of the sun in all its rising and setting places throughout the year."
"He decked the nearest heavens with ornaments of stars,",5,37,إِنَّا زَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِزِينَةٍ ٱلْكَوَاكِبِ,"Indeed, I have beautified the nearest of the heavens to the earth with a beautiful decoration: the stars that are like sparkling jewels to the eyesight."
"Protecting them against every wayward devil,",6,37,وَحِفْظًا مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَٰنٍ مَّارِدٍ,"And I have protected the nearest sky from every rebellious satan, who abstains from my obedience, with the shooting stars."
"So that they are not able to listen to the angels of higher (echelons), and are pelted from all sides",7,37,لَّا يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلَإِ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ وَيُقْذَفُونَ مِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ,"These satans are not able to hear the angels in the heavens, when they discuss the law and decree of Allah they are inspired with. They are bombarded with shooting stars from all sides."
"And kept far away. There is perpetual punishment for them,",8,37,دُحُورًا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ وَاصِبٌ,"To exile them and drive them away from eavesdropping. And in the Hereafter they will suffer a painful, everlasting punishment which will not end."
Except those who eavesdrop and are pursued by a shooting flame.,9,37,إِلَّا مَنْ خَطِفَ ٱلْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُۥ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ,"Except for those satans who happen to quickly snatch something; a statement that the angels discuss among themselves which the people of earth have not yet received information of. A shooting star then goes after it and burns it. Sometimes, the satan is able to pass that information on to its companion before it is burnt by the shooting star, and it reaches the fortune-tellers, who tell a hundred lies with it."
"So ask them if they are more difficult to create, or the rest We have created? Indeed (man) We created from fermented clay.",10,37,فَٱسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَهُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَم مَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَٰهُم مِّن طِينٍ لَّازِبٍۭ,"O Muhammad! So ask the disbelievers who reject the resurrection: “Are you harder to create, and greater in form than other things that Allah has created from the heavens, the earth and the angels?” Indeed, Allah created them from sticky clay, so how could they deny the resurrection when they were created from such a weak substance?"
"Yet while you are filled with wonder, they just scoff;",11,37,بَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخَرُونَ,"O Muhammad! You are amazed at the power of Allah and His management of the affairs of His creation; you are astonished at the idolaters rejecting the resurrection. While these idolaters mock at what you say regarding the resurrection, due to their extreme denial of it."
And when they are warned they pay no heed.,12,37,وَإِذَا ذُكِّرُوا۟ لَا يَذْكُرُونَ,"If these idolaters were to be advised with any advice, they would not take heed from it and would not benefit, because of their hard-heartedness."
"When they see a sign, they laugh at it,",13,37,وَإِذَا رَأَوْا۟ ءَايَةً يَسْتَسْخِرُونَ,"And when they witness a miracle from the miracles of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that prove his truthfulness, they exaggerate in showing astonishment and mocking it."
"And say: ""This is only magic.",14,37,وَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"And they say, “This thing that Muhammad has brought is nothing but clear sorcery.”"
"When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, how can we be raised again,",15,37,أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَٰمًا أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ,"“So when we die and become dust and decomposed, crumbling bones, will we be resurrected alive after that? That is indeed, far-fetched.”"
"And our fathers too?""",16,37,أَوَءَابَآؤُنَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ,“Will our ancient forefathers who dies before us also be resurrected?”
"You say: ""Yes; and you will be lowly made.""",17,37,قُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَٰخِرُونَ,"O Muhammad! Say to them in reply: “Yes, you shall be resurrected after you have turned into dust and decomposed bones, and your forefathers will also be resurrected; you will all be resurrected in the condition that you are in a despised and humiliating state.”"
"There will only be a single jerk, and they will gape,",18,37,فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَٰحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ,"It will only be one blow of the trumpet (the second blowing), and suddenly they will all be looking at the horrors of the Day of Judgement, awaiting what Allah will do with them."
"And say: ""Ah woe! This is the Day of Reckoning.""",19,37,وَقَالُوا۟ يَٰوَيْلَنَا هَٰذَا يَوْمُ ٱلدِّينِ,"The idolaters who reject the resurrection say, “May we be doomed! This is the Day of Requital on which Allah will requite His servants for whatever deeds they sent forth in their worldly life!”"
"""(Yes,) this is the Day of Judgement you had called a lie.""",20,37,هَٰذَا يَوْمُ ٱلْفَصْلِ ٱلَّذِى كُنتُم بِهِۦ تُكَذِّبُونَ,"It will be said to them: “This is the Day of Judgement between the servants, which you used to deny and reject in the world!”"
"Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped",21,37,ٱحْشُرُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ وَأَزْوَٰجَهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْبُدُونَ,"On that day, it will be said to the angels, “Gather the idolaters and their like, who wronged due to their ascribing partners with Allah; all those who followed them in rejection, and all the idols they used to worship instead of Allah. And show them all the path to the hellfire; lead them on to it and drive them towards it, because it is their abode.”"
"Other than God,"" (the angels will be told), ""then show them the way to Hell,",22,37,مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَٱهْدُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"On that day, it will be said to the angels, “Gather the idolaters and their like, who wronged due to their ascribing partners with Allah; all those who followed them in rejection, and all the idols they used to worship instead of Allah. And show them all the path to the hellfire; lead them on to it and drive them towards it, because it is their abode.”"
"And detain them, for they will be questioned.""",23,37,وَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُم مَّسْـُٔولُونَ,"“And hold them back for a while before entering them into the hellfire for them to give account, because they are to be questioned. Then after that, drive them towards the hellfire.”"
"""What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?""",24,37,مَا لَكُمْ لَا تَنَاصَرُونَ,"And it will be said to them in rebuke, “What is the matter with you that you are not helping each other like you used to in the world, and you used to claim that your idols would help you?”"
"They will submit to questioning then,",25,37,بَلْ هُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ مُسْتَسْلِمُونَ,"Rather, today they are submissive to the command of Allah and humiliated, they will not help each other because of their incapability to do so, and because of their lack of strategies."
"And some of them will confront the others,",26,37,وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"And they will turn to each other blaming each other and arguing, when shifting the blame and arguing will be of no use."
"Saying: ""It were you who imposed yourselves upon us.""",27,37,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَأْتُونَنَا عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ,"The followers will say to the leaders, “O our seniors! You use to approach us in matters of religion and truth, and would beautify for us disbelief, ascribing partners with Allah and sins, while scaring us away from the truth that the messengers brought from Allah.”"
"They will say: ""No, you were the ones who would not believe.",28,37,قَالُوا۟ بَل لَّمْ تَكُونُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ,"The leaders will say to the followers: “The matter is not as you claim it is. Rather, you yourselves were upon disbelief and were not believers; you were the rejectors.”"
"We had no power over you. In fact, you were a people rebellious.",29,37,وَمَا كَانَ لَنَا عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَٰنٍۭ بَلْ كُنتُمْ قَوْمًا طَٰغِينَ,"“O followers! We had no power or authority over you such that we cause you to disbelieve, ascribe partners with Allah or commit sins. Rather, you were people who transgressed the limit in disbelief and deviance yourselves; we were not the ones who led you astray.”"
"The sentence of our Lord has come true for us. We have certainly to taste (the punishment),",30,37,فَحَقَّ عَلَيْنَا قَوْلُ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا لَذَآئِقُونَ,"“So the promise of Allah is now imposing on us and on you, when He said, “I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that follow you all together.” (Ṣād: 85), and because of that we are inevitably going to taste whatever our Lord has promised.”"
"For we had led you astray. In fact we ourselves were astray.""",31,37,فَأَغْوَيْنَٰكُمْ إِنَّا كُنَّا غَٰوِينَ,"“So we called you towards deviance and disbelief; we had deviated from the path of guidance, but all you did was that you followed us because of your disposition to incline towards disbelief and deviance.”"
"So, they will become partners in punishment.",32,37,فَإِنَّهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ,So the followers and the leaders will share in the punishment on the Day of Judgement; none will benefit the other in any way because they were all partners in deviance and disbelief in the world.
That is how We deal with sinners.,33,37,إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَفْعَلُ بِٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Indeed, just as I did with these people by making them taste the punishment, I will do the same with other criminals by joining the followers and leaders in the punishment, each in proportion to whatever they deserve of it."
"They were those who, when it was said to them, ""There is no god but God,"" behaved with insolence,",34,37,إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوٓا۟ إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"Indeed, these idolaters, when it would be said to them in the world, “There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah” so that they could act upon its requirements and leave everything that contradicted it, they would reject answering the call to it and submitting to it out of arrogance from the truth and showing haughtiness to it."
"And said: ""Should we abandon our gods for the sake of an insane poet?""",35,37,وَيَقُولُونَ أَئِنَّا لَتَارِكُوٓا۟ ءَالِهَتِنَا لِشَاعِرٍ مَّجْنُونٍۭ,"And they would say, justifying their disbelief: “Should we leave the worship of our idols because of the words of a mad poet?” intending through this statement of theirs: the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)."
Not in the least. He has brought the truth and confirmed the other messengers.,36,37,بَلْ جَآءَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَصَدَّقَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Verily, they have spoken a grave lie, because the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was not a madman nor a poet; he brought the Qur’ān which calls towards the oneness of Allah and towards following His Messenger. He corroborated the message of monotheism and affirmation of the afterlife the messengers brought from Allah; he did not contradict them in anything."
"You will indeed taste a painful punishment,",37,37,إِنَّكُمْ لَذَآئِقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْأَلِيمِ,O idolaters! You are surely going to suffer the painful punishment on the Day of Judgement due to your disbelief and rejection of the messengers.
"And be rewarded but only for what you had done,",38,37,وَمَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,O idolaters! Your requital will only be for the disbelief and sins you used to commit in the world.
"Except the chosen creatures of God,",39,37,إِلَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,"However, the believing servants of Allah whom Allah chose for His worship, and they sincerely devoted worship to Him, will be in a place of safety from this punishment."
Whose provision is predetermined --,40,37,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ رِزْقٌ مَّعْلُومٌ,"For those sincere servants will be a special provision granted to them by Allah, well-known for its purity, beauty and eternity."
"Fruits of every kind, and they will be honoured",41,37,فَوَٰكِهُ وَهُم مُّكْرَمُونَ,From this special provision will be that they are provided with the purest of fruits they ever eat and desire; on top of that they will be honoured with their ranks being raised and being able to see the blessed face of Allah.
"In gardens of delight,",42,37,فِى جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"All that they will get in the permanent gardens of everlasting bliss, which will never expire or cease to exist."
"(Sitting) on couches, face to face,",43,37,عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَٰبِلِينَ,They will lean on thrones opposite to and facing one another; each one happy to meet his brother.
"With cups from a flowing stream being passed around,",44,37,يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِم بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍۭ,"Glasses of wine, clear like flowing water, shall be passed around them."
"Clear, delicious to drink,",45,37,بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّٰرِبِينَ,"White in colour, whoever drinks from it will enjoy a complete sensation."
"Neither dulling the senses nor intoxicating,",46,37,لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ,"It will not be like the wine of the world; there will be no intoxication that clouds the minds, nor will it give its drinkers headaches. The bodies and minds of its drinkers will remain safe."
"And with them maidens of modest look and large lustrous eyes,",47,37,وَعِندَهُمْ قَٰصِرَٰتُ ٱلطَّرْفِ عِينٌ,"In Paradise, they will also have chaste wives with beautiful eyes, who will not longingly look towards anyone other than their husbands."
Like sheltered eggs in a nest.,48,37,كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ,"In their white complexation blended with a tinge of redness, it will be as if they were ostrich eggs covered by feathers from the wind and dust; protected and untouched by any hand."
Then one turned to the other in an enquiry.,49,37,فَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"The people of Paradise will turn to one another asking about their past, and what happened to them in the world."
"Said one of the speakers: ""I had a friend",50,37,قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ إِنِّى كَانَ لِى قَرِينٌ,"One of the believers will say, “Indeed, I had a companion in the world who would deny the resurrection.”"
Who used to say: 'Are you one of those who can testify to the truth?,51,37,يَقُولُ أَءِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُصَدِّقِينَ,"He would say to me in denial and mockingly, “O my friend! Are you one of those who believe in the resurrection of the dead?”"
(Do you think) we would be paid back our due when we are dead and reduced to dust and bones?',52,37,أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَٰمًا أَءِنَّا لَمَدِينُونَ,"“When we die and turn into dust and decayed bones, will we then be resurrected and requited for our deeds we did in the world?”"
He said: 'Will you look down?',53,37,قَالَ هَلْ أَنتُم مُّطَّلِعُونَ,His believing companion will say to his companions of the people of Paradise: “Take a look with me; let us see the outcome of that companion of mine who used to deny the resurrection.”
He looked down and saw (his friend) in the midst of Hell.,54,37,فَٱطَّلَعَ فَرَءَاهُ فِى سَوَآءِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,So he will take a look and see his companion in the middle of hell.
"'By God', he said, 'you had almost ruined me.",55,37,قَالَ تَٱللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرْدِينِ,"He will say: “O my companion! By Allah, you were close to dooming me to the hellfire by calling me towards disbelief and denying the resurrection!”"
Had it not been for the grace of my Lord I too would have been there (in Hell).,56,37,وَلَوْلَا نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْضَرِينَ,"“Had it not been for Allah blessing me with guidance to faith and the ability to accept it, I would have been one of those brought to the punishment like you.”"
"(Another will say:)""Is it true, we are not going to die",57,37,أَفَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَيِّتِينَ,"“We, the people of Paradise, will never die.”"
"Other than our first death, and we shall not be punished?",58,37,إِلَّا مَوْتَتَنَا ٱلْأُولَىٰ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ,"“Except the first death of ours in the world. Instead, we will live forever in Paradise and will not be punished like the disbelievers will be.”"
This will indeed be great happiness.,59,37,إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"“Indeed, this requital of ours which our Lord has given us, i.e entry into Paradise, living in it forever and salvation from the hellfire, is the greatest, unparallelled success.”"
"For this the toilers should strive.""",60,37,لِمِثْلِ هَٰذَا فَلْيَعْمَلِ ٱلْعَٰمِلُونَ,"It is for requital like this the workers should strive for, because this is the profitable trade."
Is this better or the tree of Zaqqum,61,37,أَذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ نُّزُلًا أَمْ شَجَرَةُ ٱلزَّقُّومِ,"Is that aforementioned bounty which Allah has prepared for His servants whom He chose to obey Him, better and more virtuous in rank and honour, than the tree of Zaqqūm which has been cursed in the Qur’ān? It is the food of the disbelievers, which neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger."
Which We have reserved as punishment for evil-doers?,62,37,إِنَّا جَعَلْنَٰهَا فِتْنَةً لِّلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"I have made this tree a trial, with which those who do wrong through disbelief and sins are tested, when they say: “Indeed, fire consumes trees, so it is impossible that it grows in the hellfire.”"
It is a tree that grows at the bottom of Hell.,63,37,إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِىٓ أَصْلِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Indeed, the tree of Zaqqūm is a disgusting tree, and is one that comes out of the depth of hell."
Its spathes are like the prickly pear.,64,37,طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُۥ رُءُوسُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينِ,"The fruits that come out of it are ugly in appearance, like the heads of satans. The ugliness in appearance is a sign of ugliness in nature, which means they revolting in taste."
"They will eat and fill their bellies with it,",65,37,فَإِنَّهُمْ لَءَاكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِـُٔونَ مِنْهَا ٱلْبُطُونَ,"Indeed, the disbelievers will eat from its bitter, ugly fruits, and fill their empty bellies with them."
Washing it down with boiling water.,66,37,ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْبًا مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ,"Then, after having eaten them, they will have a disgusting, boiling cocktail to drink."
Then to Hell they will surely be returned.,67,37,ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لَإِلَى ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Then, their return after that will be to the punishment of hell; they will move from one punishment to another."
"They had found their fathers astray,",68,37,إِنَّهُمْ أَلْفَوْا۟ ءَابَآءَهُمْ ضَآلِّينَ,"Indeed, these disbelievers found their forefathers astray from the path of guidance and followed them blindly without proof of their truth."
Yet they hasten to follow in their footsteps.,69,37,فَهُمْ عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِمْ يُهْرَعُونَ,"So they hastily followed the footsteps of their forefathers in deviance, as if they were harassed and forced into doing so."
"So had many an earlier people gone astray,",70,37,وَلَقَدْ ضَلَّ قَبْلَهُمْ أَكْثَرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"Verily, the majority of people before them also went astray. So O Messenger, those to whom you have been sent are not the first to go astray."
And We had sent admonishers to them.,71,37,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيهِم مُّنذِرِينَ,"Verily, I sent to the previous nations messengers who would warn them of the punishment of Allah, but they disbelieved."
"Look, then how was the end of those who had been warned,",72,37,فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,"O Messenger! See what the outcome was of the nations who were warned by their messengers but did not accept their warning! Indeed, their outcome was entering into the hellfire having to live in it forever due to their disbelief and rejection of their messengers."
Other than the chosen creatures of God.,73,37,إِلَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,Except for those whom Allah chose to believe in Him and His oneness; they were saved from the punishment which was the outcome of the disbelieving rejectors.
Noah had verily called to Us. And how gracious was He who answered (him).,74,37,وَلَقَدْ نَادَىٰنَا نُوحٌ فَلَنِعْمَ ٱلْمُجِيبُونَ,"Verily, My Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) called out to Me when he supplicated against his people who had rejected him. I am the best of answerers; I quickly answered his supplication against his people."
"We saved him and his family from the great affliction,",75,37,وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"And I saved him, together with members of his household and the believers with him from the harm of his people and from drowning in the great flood, which was sent upon the disbelievers from his people."
"And made his progeny survive,",76,37,وَجَعَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُۥ هُمُ ٱلْبَاقِينَ,"I saved his family members and his believing followers only, because I drowned the others from his disbelieving nation."
And left (his name) for posterity.,77,37,وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,"And I left a good legacy for him in the nations that would come after, who would praise Noah and always mention him with good."
Peace on Noah among all men.,78,37,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰ نُوحٍ فِى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"It is a security and safety for Noah from the following nations saying evil regarding him. Instead, praise and positive mention of him will remain."
That is how We reward those who do good.,79,37,إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Indeed, I grant those who do good through their worship and obedience to Me alone, the same type of reward I granted to Noah."
Surely he was among Our faithful creatures.,80,37,إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Noah was definitely one of My servants who believed and acted according to My obedience.
Afterwards We drowned the others.,81,37,ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا ٱلْءَاخَرِينَ,"Then, I drowned the rest by the flood I sent upon them. None of them remained."
"And Abraham indeed was of his inducement,",82,37,وَإِنَّ مِن شِيعَتِهِۦ لَإِبْرَٰهِيمَ,"Indeed, Abraham was someone on the same religion as Noah, and he also called to the Oneness of Allah."
"When he came to his Lord with a heart compliant,",83,37,إِذْ جَآءَ رَبَّهُۥ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ,"Remember when he came to his Lord with a heart pure from ascribing partners to Allah and from doubts, full of sincerity to Allah only wanted good for the creation."
"When he said to his father and his people: ""What is this you worship?",84,37,إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِۦ مَاذَا تَعْبُدُونَ,"When he said to his father and his idolatrous nation, rebuking them, “What do you worship instead of Allah?”"
Why do you solicit false gods instead of God?,85,37,أَئِفْكًا ءَالِهَةً دُونَ ٱللَّهِ تُرِيدُونَ,"“O my people, do you prefer to worship idols besides Allah basing your worship on a completely fabricated lie?”"
"What do you imagine the Lord of the worlds to be?""",86,37,فَمَا ظَنُّكُم بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"“O my people! What do you think will happen when you meet the Lord of the worlds, while you used to worship things other than Him? What do you think He will do to you?”"
"Then he looked up at the stars (they worshipped),",87,37,فَنَظَرَ نَظْرَةً فِى ٱلنُّجُومِ,"So Abraham took a glance at the stars, hatching a plan to come out of having to go out with his people."
"And said: ""I am sick (of what you worship)!""",88,37,فَقَالَ إِنِّى سَقِيمٌ,"He said, presenting an excuse from having to go with his people to their festival, “I am sick.”"
But they turned their backs on him and went away.,89,37,فَتَوَلَّوْا۟ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ,So they left him behind and went.
"Then he turned towards their gods and said: ""Why do you not eat (of these offerings)?",90,37,فَرَاغَ إِلَىٰٓ ءَالِهَتِهِمْ فَقَالَ أَلَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"He turned towards the idols they would worship instead of Allah, and said mocking them, “Will you not eat from the food the idolaters make for you?”"
"What is wrong with you that you do not speak?""",91,37,مَا لَكُمْ لَا تَنطِقُونَ,"“What is the matter with you that you do not speak, nor answer whoever asks you? Can this type of thing be worshipped instead of Allah?”"
Then he started striking them down with his right hand.,92,37,فَرَاغَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْبًۢا بِٱلْيَمِينِ,"Then, Abraham started hitting them with his right hand, intending to break them."
So the people descended upon him.,93,37,فَأَقْبَلُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ يَزِفُّونَ,So the worshippers of these idols came rushing to him.
"""Why do you worship these you carve yourselves,"" he asked,",94,37,قَالَ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا تَنْحِتُونَ,"But Abraham countered them with steadfastness, and said to them rebuking them, “Do you worship idols instead of Allah, which you carve with your own hands?”"
"""When God has created you and what you make?""",95,37,وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"“While Allah (may He be glorified) is the one who created your bodies and your actions; the making of these idols are also from your actions, so He is most deserving that you worship Him alone and not ascribe partners with Him."
"""Build a pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire.""",96,37,قَالُوا۟ ٱبْنُوا۟ لَهُۥ بُنْيَٰنًا فَأَلْقُوهُ فِى ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"When they became speechless to his clear reasoning they resorted to violence, and consulted with each other about what they should do with Abraham. They said, “Build a structure from him, fill it with firewood and set it on fire, then throw him into it.”"
"So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject.",97,37,فَأَرَادُوا۟ بِهِۦ كَيْدًا فَجَعَلْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْأَسْفَلِينَ,"So the people of Abraham intended to do evil to Abraham by destroying him so they could be saved from him, but I made them the losers when I made the fire cool and safe for him."
"And he said: ""I am going away to my Lord who will show me the way.",98,37,وَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ,"Abraham said, “I am going to emigrate to my Lord and leave the city of my people so that I am able worship Him. My Lord will guide me to whatever is good for me in the world and the Hereafter.”"
"(And he prayed:) ""O Lord, grant me a righteous son.""",99,37,رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,“O my Lord! Grant me a pious child who will be a means of help for me and a substitute for me from my people in the wilderness.”
So We gave him the good news of a clement son.,100,37,فَبَشَّرْنَٰهُ بِغُلَٰمٍ حَلِيمٍ,"So I answered his supplication for him and gave him news which pleased him, when I gave him the good news of a child who would grow old and become forbearing. This child was Ishmael (peace be upon him)."
"When he was old enough to go about with him, he said: ""O my son, I dreamt that I was sacrificing you. Consider, what you think?"" He replied: ""Father, do as you are commanded. If God pleases you will find me firm.""",101,37,فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ ٱلسَّعْىَ قَالَ يَٰبُنَىَّ إِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰ فِى ٱلْمَنَامِ أَنِّىٓ أَذْبَحُكَ فَٱنظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَىٰ قَالَ يَٰٓأَبَتِ ٱفْعَلْ مَا تُؤْمَرُ سَتَجِدُنِىٓ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"When Ishmael grew into a youth and reached working age, his father Abraham saw a dream. The dreams of prophets are a form of divine revelation, so Abraham said to his son, informing him of the meaning of this dream, “O my son! Indeed, I saw in my sleep that I am slaughtering you; what is your opinion in the matter?” Ishmael replied to him saying, “O my father! Do whatever Allah has commanded you to do in slaughtering me. You will find me one of those who are patient and content with the order of Allah.”"
"When they submitted to the will of God, and (Abraham) laid (his son) down prostrate on his temple,",102,37,فَلَمَّآ أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُۥ لِلْجَبِينِ,"So when they submitted to Allah and obeyed him, Abraham laid his son down on his forehead, to carry out the order given to him to slaughter his son."
"We called out: ""O Abraham,",103,37,وَنَٰدَيْنَٰهُ أَن يَٰٓإِبْرَٰهِيمُ,"I called out to Abraham while he was about to carry out the order of Allah to slaughter his son, saying: “O Abraham!”"
"You have fulfilled your dream."" Thus do We reward the good.",104,37,قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ ٱلرُّءْيَآ إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"“You have fulfilled the dream you saw in your sleep by resolving to slaughter your son. Just as I rewarded you by freeing you of this great trial, I also reward those who do good by saving them from trials and difficulties.”"
That was indeed a trying test.,105,37,إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْبَلَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"Indeed, this was a clear test which Abraham passed."
"So We ransomed him for a great sacrifice,",106,37,وَفَدَيْنَٰهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ,And I set Ishmael free in exchange for a huge ram which was to be slaughtered instead of him.
And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity.,107,37,وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,I preserved good praise for Abraham to remain among the following nations.
Peace be on Abraham.,108,37,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ,"As a commemoration for Abraham from Allah, and a prayer to keep him safe from every harm and difficulty."
That is how We reward those who do good.,109,37,كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Just as I requited Abraham with this reward for his obedience, I also reward those who do good."
He is truly among Our faithful creatures.,110,37,إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, Abraham was one of My believing servants who fulfilled the demands of his servitude to Me."
"So We gave him the good news of Isaac, apostle, who is among the righteous.",111,37,وَبَشَّرْنَٰهُ بِإِسْحَٰقَ نَبِيًّا مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"And I gave him glad tidings of another son who would become a Prophet and a pious servant: he was Isaac. It was another reward for his obedience to Allah by resolving to slaughter his only son, Ishmael."
"And We blessed him and Isaac. Among their descendants are some who do good, but some who wrong themselves.",112,37,وَبَٰرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَىٰٓ إِسْحَٰقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِۦ مُبِينٌ,"And I showered upon him and his son Isaac My special blessings and gave them both many bounties, from which one was an increase in offspring. There were those in their progeny who did good by obeying their Lord, and those who clearly wronged themselves by disbelief and committing sins."
"We were indeed gracious to Moses and Aaron,",113,37,وَلَقَدْ مَنَنَّا عَلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ,And verily I favoured Moses and his brother Aaron with messengership.
"And saved them and their people from great distress,",114,37,وَنَجَّيْنَٰهُمَا وَقَوْمَهُمَا مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"I saved them and their nation, the Israelites, from Pharaoh enslaving them and from drowning."
"And helped them, so they were victorious.",115,37,وَنَصَرْنَٰهُمْ فَكَانُوا۟ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبِينَ,"I also helped them against Pharaoh and his armies, so they had the upper hand over their enemies."
"We gave them the explicit Book,",116,37,وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُمَا ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ٱلْمُسْتَبِينَ,I gave Moses and his brother Aaron the Torah; a clear book from Allah in which there was no doubt.
"And showed them the straight path,",117,37,وَهَدَيْنَٰهُمَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,I also guided them towards the straight path in which there was no deviance. It was the path of the religion of Islam which led to the pleasure of the Creator (may He be glorified).
And left (their remembrance) for posterity.,118,37,وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِمَا فِى ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,And I also preserved for them positive mention and good praise among the following nations.
Peace be on Moses and Aaron.,119,37,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ,"As a commemoration from Allah for them, in praise of them and as a prayer for safety from every harm."
That is how We reward those who do good.,120,37,إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Just as I requited Moses and Aaron with this good reward, I also reward those who do good by obeying their Lord."
They are among Our faithful devotees.,121,37,إِنَّهُمَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, Moses and Aaron were two of My servants who believed in me and strove to do that which I legislated for them."
Verily Elias is one of the apostles.,122,37,وَإِنَّ إِلْيَاسَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"Indeed, Elias was one of the messengers sent by his Lord. He blessed him with messengership and prophethood."
"When he said to his people: ""Will you not be mindful of God?",123,37,إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِۦٓ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ,"Remember when he said to his people whom he was sent towards from the Israelites, “O my people! Will you not fear Allah by fulfilling His commands, of which is monotheism, and refraining from the things He has not allowed, from which is ascribing partners with Him?”"
"Would you call on Baal and leave the best of creators,",124,37,أَتَدْعُونَ بَعْلًا وَتَذَرُونَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْخَٰلِقِينَ,“Do you worship your idol Ba‘l instead of Allah and leave the worship of Allah who is the best of creators?”
"God, your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers?""",125,37,ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ وَرَبَّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"“Allah is your lord who created you and created your forefathers before you; He is the most deserving of worship, not anything else like the idols which cannot benefit nor harm.”"
"They denied him, and will surely be brought to punishment,",126,37,فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ,"The only response of his nation was that they rejected him, and because of their rejection they will be brought to the punishment."
Except the chosen creatures of God.,127,37,إِلَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,Except for those who were believers and devoted their worship to Allah alone; they will be saved from being brought to the punishment.
And We left his (memory) for posterity.,128,37,وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,And I also preserved for him positive mention and good praise among the following nations.
Peace be on Elias.,129,37,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰٓ إِلْ يَاسِينَ,As a commemoration from Allah and praise for Elias.
That is how We reward those who do good.,130,37,إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Just as I requited Elias with this good reward, I also reward those of My believing servants who do good."
He is truly among Our faithful devotees.,131,37,إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Indeed, Elias was one of My true believing servants who are sincere in their belief in Me."
"Verily Lot was one of the apostles,",132,37,وَإِنَّ لُوطًا لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"And indeed, Lot was one of the messengers of Allah who were sent to their people as bearers of good news and warners."
Wherefore We saved him and his entire family,133,37,إِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰهُ وَأَهْلَهُۥٓ أَجْمَعِينَ,So remember when I saved him and members of his household from the punishment that was sent upon his people.
Except an old woman who was one of those who stayed behind.,134,37,إِلَّا عَجُوزًا فِى ٱلْغَٰبِرِينَ,"Except for his wife, because she was a woman whom the punishment of her people included within it, due to her being a disbeliever like them."
Then We destroyed the others.,135,37,ثُمَّ دَمَّرْنَا ٱلْءَاخَرِينَ,"Then, I destroyed the remainder of his people who rejected him and did not believe in what he had brought."
You pass by (their habitations) in the morning,136,37,وَإِنَّكُمْ لَتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِم مُّصْبِحِينَ,"O people of Makkah! Indeed, you pass by their dwellings in you journeys towards the Levant in the morning."
Or at night. Then how is it you do not understand?,137,37,وَبِٱلَّيْلِ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ,"And likewise, you also pass by them at night. So do you not understand and take heed from the outcome of these people after they rejected, disbelieved and committed indecency, indecent behaviour, immorality, immoral behaviour, sexual indecency, sexual immortality which was unprecedented?"
Verily Jonah is one of the apostles.,138,37,وَإِنَّ يُونُسَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"And indeed, Jonah was one of the messengers of Allah who were sent to their people as bearers of good news and warners."
"When he fled on the laden ship,",139,37,إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلْمَشْحُونِ,"Remember when he became angry over his people and left them, boarding a ship full of passengers and goods."
"And lots were cast (when a storm overtook them), he was rejected, (and thrown overboard).",140,37,فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُدْحَضِينَ,"The ship was close to sinking because of its load, so the passengers drew lots to throw some of them overboard, fearing its sinking because of too many passengers. Jonah was one of the names that were drawn, and so they threw him in to the sea."
Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame.,141,37,فَٱلْتَقَمَهُ ٱلْحُوتُ وَهُوَ مُلِيمٌ,"So when they threw him into the sea, a whale took him and swallowed him. He was to face the blame that was to come to him, because of him going to the sea without permission from his Lord."
"Had he not been one of those who struggled hard,",142,37,فَلَوْلَآ أَنَّهُۥ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسَبِّحِينَ,"Had it not been that Jonah was one of those who would remember Allah abundantly before whatever afflicted him, and had it not been for his glorifying Allah in the stomach of the whale"
He would have stayed in its belly till the day the dead are raised.,143,37,لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِۦٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,"he would have remained in the stomach of the whale until the Day of Judgement, with it having become his grave."
"So We cast him, sick, on a barren shore,",144,37,فَنَبَذْنَٰهُ بِٱلْعَرَآءِ وَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ,"So I took him from the stomach of the whale and placed him on a land barren of trees and buildings, in the state that he was physically weak because of having stayed in the stomach of the whale for a while."
And We made a gourd tree grow over him.,145,37,وَأَنۢبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ,"I then made a gourd tree grow for him on that barren earth, which would give him shade."
"We sent him to a hundred thousand men or more,",146,37,وَأَرْسَلْنَٰهُ إِلَىٰ مِا۟ئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ,"And I sent him back to his people, their number being a hundred thousand and more."
And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age.,147,37,فَـَٔامَنُوا۟ فَمَتَّعْنَٰهُمْ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"They brought faith and believed in whatever He brought, so Allah granted them enjoyment in their worldly lives until their fixed lifetimes expired."
"Now ask them if their Lord has daughters, and they sons?",148,37,فَٱسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ ٱلْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ ٱلْبَنُونَ,"O Muhammad! So ask these idolaters, idolaters a rebuking question: “Do you attribute for Allah daughters which you yourselves dislike, while attributing sons for yourselves whom you love? What kind of distribution is this?”"
"Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it?",149,37,أَمْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ إِنَٰثًا وَهُمْ شَٰهِدُونَ,How could they claim the angels are female when they were not present at the time of their creation and did not witness it?
Is it not a lie invented by them when they say:,150,37,أَلَآ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ,"Listen carefully! Indeed, the idolaters, idolaters from their attributing lies unto Allah"
"""God has begotten (children)?"" They are liars indeed!",151,37,وَلَدَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"attribute offspring to Him, and indeed, they are liars in this claim of theirs."
Does He prefer sons to daughters?,152,37,أَصْطَفَى ٱلْبَنَاتِ عَلَى ٱلْبَنِينَ,"Would Allah prefer daughters for Himself which you dislike, over sons which you like? Never!"
What ails you that you judge in such a wise?,153,37,مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,"O idolaters, what is wrong with you that you make this unjust judgment where you make daughters for Allah and sons for yourself?"
Why do you not reflect?,154,37,أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Would you not take admonition of this wrong belief you are on? If you were to take heed, you would stop saying such as statement."
Or have you received some clear authority?,155,37,أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَٰنٌ مُّبِينٌ,Or do you have a clear proof from a divine scripture or a messenger from Allah?
"Then bring your scripture, if what you say is true.",156,37,فَأْتُوا۟ بِكِتَٰبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,Then bring your book which bears for you evidence of this if you are true in what you claim.
"They link Him with jinns by lineage, yet the jinns know they will be brought before Him.",157,37,وَجَعَلُوا۟ بَيْنَهُۥ وَبَيْنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ نَسَبًا وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ ٱلْجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ,"And the idolaters made blood ties between Allah and the angels when they claimed the angels are Allah’s daughters and their mothers are the elite jinns. But the jinns already know Allah will bring them to be reckoned, so if there was lineage between Him and them he would not bring them for that."
God is too glorious for what they ascribe to Him,158,37,سُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"Pure is Allah and exalted from what the idolaters describe Him with of that which does not befit Him, such as children, partners."
Except His chosen creatures who do not.,159,37,إِلَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,"Except Allah’s chosen servants, as they do not describe Allah except with the qualities of majesty and perfection which are befitting for Him."
So neither you nor those you worship,160,37,فَإِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ,"So you, O idolaters, and what you worship besides Allah."
"Can mislead anyone away from Him,",161,37,مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَٰتِنِينَ,You cannot misguide anyone from the true religion.
Except one who is (destined) to burn in Hell.,162,37,إِلَّا مَنْ هُوَ صَالِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Except one whom Allah has decreed is from the people of hell, as Allah will carry out His decree regarding him and so he will disbelieve and enter the fire. As for you and your gods, you do not have power over that."
"""There is not one of us who does not have his appointed place,"" (declare the angels.)",163,37,وَمَا مِنَّآ إِلَّا لَهُۥ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ,"And the angels said, stating their servitude to Allah and their being free of what the idolaters claimed: “There is nobody amongst us except that he has a known position in Allah’s worship and obedience."
"""And we are truly those who stand in rows,",164,37,وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلصَّآفُّونَ,And we declare Him pure of qualities and descriptions which do not befit Him”.
"And we are those who sing hallelujas to Him.""",165,37,وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلْمُسَبِّحُونَ,And we declare Him pure of qualities and descriptions which do not befit Him”.
They used to say:,166,37,وَإِن كَانُوا۟ لَيَقُولُونَ,"170. And the idolaters from the people of Makkah used to say before Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent: “If we had a book of the previous people, such as the Torah for example, we would have worshipped Allah sincerely”. But they are lying in that, as Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought them the Qur’ān but they disbelieved in it. So soon they will know the severe punishment that is waiting for them on the day of judgment."
"If we had the account of earlier people with us,",167,37,لَوْ أَنَّ عِندَنَا ذِكْرًا مِّنَ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"170. And the idolaters from the people of Makkah used to say before Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent: “If we had a book of the previous people, such as the Torah for example, we would have worshipped Allah sincerely”. But they are lying in that, as Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought them the Qur’ān but they disbelieved in it. So soon they will know the severe punishment that is waiting for them on the day of judgment."
"We would have been the chosen creatures of God.""",168,37,لَكُنَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,"170. And the idolaters from the people of Makkah used to say before Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent: “If we had a book of the previous people, such as the Torah for example, we would have worshipped Allah sincerely”. But they are lying in that, as Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought them the Qur’ān but they disbelieved in it. So soon they will know the severe punishment that is waiting for them on the day of judgment."
Yet now (that it has come) they refuse to believe in it; but they will come to know soon.,169,37,فَكَفَرُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"170. And the idolaters from the people of Makkah used to say before Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent: “If we had a book of the previous people, such as the Torah for example, we would have worshipped Allah sincerely”. But they are lying in that, as Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought them the Qur’ān but they disbelieved in it. So soon they will know the severe punishment that is waiting for them on the day of judgment."
"Our word had already been given before to Our votaries, the apostles, --",170,37,وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"And victory is for My army which fights in My way, so that My word is the highest."
"That they would be helped,",171,37,إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ ٱلْمَنصُورُونَ,"And victory is for My army which fights in My way, so that My word is the highest."
And that certainly Our armies will be victorious.,172,37,وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ,"And victory is for My army which fights in My way, so that My word is the highest."
So you ignore them for a time,173,37,فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,"So turn away, O Messenger, from these stubborn idolaters until a time which Allah knows, until the time of their punishment comes."
And wait; they will come to know soon.,174,37,وَأَبْصِرْهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يُبْصِرُونَ,"And look at them when the punishment comes upon them, for they themselves will see when seeing will not benefit."
Do they want to hasten Our punishment?,175,37,أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,Then do these idolaters hastily seek the punishment of Allah?
"When it comes down on their plains, it will be an evil dawn for those who had been warned.",176,37,فَإِذَا نَزَلَ بِسَاحَتِهِمْ فَسَآءَ صَبَاحُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,"Then when Allah’s punishment comes upon them, what a bad morning will theirs be!"
So turn away from them for a time,177,37,وَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,"And turn away, O Messenger, from them when Allah decides their punishment."
And watch; they will come to know soon.,178,37,وَأَبْصِرْ فَسَوْفَ يُبْصِرُونَ,"And look, for these people will see the punishment and punishment of Allah that comes upon them."
"Too glorious is your Lord, the Lord of power, for what they ascribe to Him.",179,37,سُبْحَٰنَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ ٱلْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"O Muhammad, exhalt your Lord declaring his glorification, the Lord of Honour, and exalt Him above the qualities of deficiency the idolaters describe Him with."
"So peace be on the messengers,",180,37,وَسَلَٰمٌ عَلَى ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And Allah’s greetings and His praise be for His noble messengers.
"And all praise to God, the Lord of all the worlds.",181,37,وَٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"And all praise is for Allah, as He is deserving of it, and He is Lord of all the creation. They have no lord besides Him."
SAD. I CALL to witness the admonishing Qur'an.,0,38,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ صٓ وَٱلْقُرْءَانِ ذِى ٱلذِّكْرِ,"Saad. By the Qur’ān containing reminder. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in the beginning of Sūrah Al-Baqarah. I swear by the Qur’ān which is full of admonition, reminding mankind that which benefits them in their worldly life and the Afterlife. The matter is not as the idolaters think, namely that Allah has partners beside Him."
But the unbelievers are still full of pride and hostility.,1,38,بَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فِى عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ,"But the disbelievers are in fanaticism and arrogance towards the oneness of Allah, and in opposition to Muhammad (peace be upon him) and hatred for him."
How many generations have We destroyed before them who cried (for mercy) when it was too late for escape.,2,38,كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ فَنَادَوا۟ وَّلَاتَ حِينَ مَنَاصٍ,"How many generations who denied their messengers before them have I destroyed, they called out seeking help when the punishment fell upon them. But the time was not the time to be saved from the punishment where seeking help from Him would benefit them."
"They were surprised that one of them had come to them as warner; and the unbelievers said: ""He is a deceiving sorcerer.",3,38,وَعَجِبُوٓا۟ أَن جَآءَهُم مُّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَقَالَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هَٰذَا سَٰحِرٌ كَذَّابٌ,"And they expressed surprise when a messenger came to them from themselves to warn them of Allah’s punishment if they remain in their disbelief. And the disbelievers said when they saw the proof for the truthfulness of what Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought: “This is a magician who performs magic on people, and a liar in claiming that he is a messenger from Allah who receives revelation."
"Has he turned so many gods into one deity? This is indeed a strange thing!""",4,38,أَجَعَلَ ٱلْءَالِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَٰحِدًا إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَىْءٌ عُجَابٌ,"Has he made the numerous gods into one God, besides whom there is no god? This act of his is extremely strange”."
"And their leading chiefs said: ""Remain attached to your gods. There is surely some motive behind it.",5,38,وَٱنطَلَقَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ ٱمْشُوا۟ وَٱصْبِرُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ ءَالِهَتِكُمْ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَىْءٌ يُرَادُ,"And their leaders and elders went, saying to their followers: “Carry on with what you are upon and do not enter the religion of Muhammad. Remain firm on worshipping your gods. That which Muhammad is calling you towards, namely worshipping one god, is something planned which he wants so that he can dominate over us and have followers for himself."
We never heard of it in the former faith. It is surely a fabrication.,6,38,مَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَٰذَا فِى ٱلْمِلَّةِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا ٱخْتِلَٰقٌ,We have not heard the oneness of Allah which Muhammad is calling us towards in what we found our fathers on nor in the religion of Jesus (peace be upon him). What we have heard from him is nothing but a lie and fabrication.
"To him of all of us has the Reminder been sent down?"" They are still in doubt about My admonition; but they have not tasted My punishment yet!",7,38,أَءُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلذِّكْرُ مِنۢ بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّن ذِكْرِى بَل لَّمَّا يَذُوقُوا۟ عَذَابِ,"Is it right that the Qur’ān is revealed to him from amongst us and he is chosen for it, and it is not revealed to us whereas we are great leaders?” But these idolaters are in doubt about the revelation which is revealed to you. And they have not yet tasted the punishment of Allah, so they have been deceived due to their being given respite. If they were to taste it, they would not have the audacity to disbelieve in Allah and doubt what is revealed to you."
"Do they have the stores of the mercy of your Lord, the mighty and munificent?",8,38,أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَآئِنُ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْوَهَّابِ,"Or do these denying idolaters have treasures of the grace of your Lord, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, who gives what He wants to whom He wants? And from His treasures is prophethood, so He gives it to whom He wishes. It is not for them that they should give it to whom they want and stop it from whom they want."
"Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, theirs? Then let them climb up the ladders (to the heavens).",9,38,أَمْ لَهُم مُّلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَلْيَرْتَقُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَسْبَٰبِ,"Or do they have the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and possession of everything therein so they may chose who to give it to? If this is what claim they are making then let them adopt the means to go up to the heavens so they can then rule how they wish from above the heavens in who should be given and who should be held back from."
They will be one more army vanquished among the many routed hordes.,10,38,جُندٌ مَّا هُنَالِكَ مَهْزُومٌ مِّنَ ٱلْأَحْزَابِ,These deniers of Muhammad (peace be upon him) are a defeated army like the armies which came before them who denied their messengers and so I destroyed them. So that will occur with this army as occurred with others.
"Even before them the people of Noah, 'Ad, the mighty Pharoah,",11,38,كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَعَادٌ وَفِرْعَوْنُ ذُو ٱلْأَوْتَادِ,"These deniers are not the first to deny, because the people of Noah, Aad, and the powerful Pharaoh denied before them."
"And the Thamud, the people of Lot, as well as the dwellers of the Wood, had denied. These were the hordes.",12,38,وَثَمُودُ وَقَوْمُ لُوطٍ وَأَصْحَٰبُ لْـَٔيْكَةِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلْأَحْزَابُ,"And Thamud, the people of Lot and the people of Shu’ayb denied. Those are the groups who were all united in their denial of the messengers and disbelief of what they brought."
Of all these there was not one who did not deny the messengers. So My retribution was justified.,13,38,إِن كُلٌّ إِلَّا كَذَّبَ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَحَقَّ عِقَابِ,"There is not a single one of these groups except that it denied the messengers. So Allah’s punishment was justified for them and His punishment befell them, even though it was delayed for a while."
They await but a single blast which will not be repeated.,14,38,وَمَا يَنظُرُ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِلَّا صَيْحَةً وَٰحِدَةً مَّا لَهَا مِن فَوَاقٍ,These deniers of Muhammad (peace be upon him) are not waiting except for the second blowing of the Trumpet in which there shall be no return. Then the punishment will fall upon them if they had died in a state of denial.
"Still they say: ""O Lord, give us our share before the Day of Reckoning.""",15,38,وَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"And they said mockingly: “Our Lord, give us our share of punishment in the worldly life before the day of judgment”."
"Bear with patience what they say, and remember Our votary David, man of strength. He surely turned to Us in penitence.",16,38,ٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَٱذْكُرْ عَبْدَنَا دَاوُۥدَ ذَا ٱلْأَيْدِ إِنَّهُۥٓ أَوَّابٌ,"O Messenger, be patient on the things these deniers say which do not please you, and remember My servant David, who had the power to fight his enemies and persevere in Allah’s obedience. He used to turn to Allah frequently through repentance and actions which please Him."
"We subjugated the chiefs (of tribes) to struggle day and night with him,",17,38,إِنَّا سَخَّرْنَا ٱلْجِبَالَ مَعَهُۥ يُسَبِّحْنَ بِٱلْعَشِىِّ وَٱلْإِشْرَاقِ,I subjugated the mountains with David. They would exalt with his exalting at the end of the day and its beginning at sunrise.
And the levied Tair. They were all obedient to him.,18,38,وَٱلطَّيْرَ مَحْشُورَةً كُلٌّ لَّهُۥٓ أَوَّابٌ,"And I subjugated the birds held in the air. Each of them was obedient, exalting out of following him."
"So We further strengthened his kingdom, and bestowed wisdom on him, and judgement in legal matters.",19,38,وَشَدَدْنَا مُلْكَهُۥ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ ٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَفَصْلَ ٱلْخِطَابِ,"And I strengthened his kingdom through the awe, strength and help against his enemies I had given him. And I gave him prophethood and correctness in his affairs. And I gave him clear eloquence in every objective, and decisiveness in speech and wisdom."
Have you heard of the litigants who jumped over the wall into his chamber?,20,38,وَهَلْ أَتَىٰكَ نَبَؤُا۟ ٱلْخَصْمِ إِذْ تَسَوَّرُوا۟ ٱلْمِحْرَابَ,"O Messenger, has the news of the two disputants come to you, when they climbed upon the place of worship of David (peace be upon him)?"
"When they came before David, he was frightened of them. ""Do not be afraid,"" they said. ""The two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other. So judge between us with equity, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the right path.",21,38,إِذْ دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ دَاوُۥدَ فَفَزِعَ مِنْهُمْ قَالُوا۟ لَا تَخَفْ خَصْمَانِ بَغَىٰ بَعْضُنَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلَا تُشْطِطْ وَٱهْدِنَآ إِلَىٰ سَوَآءِ ٱلصِّرَٰطِ,"When they entered upon David suddenly, so he became frightened due to their strange act of entering upon him in this most unusual of ways. When they saw his fear, they said: “Do not fear. We are two disputants, one of us having wronged the other, so judge between us justly and do not be unjust when you judge between us, and guide us to the right path which is the path of correctness”."
"This man here is my brother. He has ninety and nine ewes while I have only one. He demands that I should give him my ewe, and wants to get the better of me in argument.""",22,38,إِنَّ هَٰذَآ أَخِى لَهُۥ تِسْعٌ وَتِسْعُونَ نَعْجَةً وَلِىَ نَعْجَةٌ وَٰحِدَةٌ فَقَالَ أَكْفِلْنِيهَا وَعَزَّنِى فِى ٱلْخِطَابِ,One of the disputants said to David (peace be upon him): “This man is my brother. He has ninety-nine ewes and I have one ewe. He asked me to give him that too and he has overpowered me in proof”.
"(David) said: ""He is unjust in demanding your ewe to add to his (many) ewes. Many partners are surely -- unjust to one another, except those who believe and do the right; but there are only a few of them."" It occurred to David that he was being tried by Us, and he begged his Lord to forgive him, and fell down in homage and repented.",23,38,قَالَ لَقَدْ ظَلَمَكَ بِسُؤَالِ نَعْجَتِكَ إِلَىٰ نِعَاجِهِۦ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلْخُلَطَآءِ لَيَبْغِى بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَقَلِيلٌ مَّا هُمْ وَظَنَّ دَاوُۥدُ أَنَّمَا فَتَنَّٰهُ فَٱسْتَغْفَرَ رَبَّهُۥ وَخَرَّ رَاكِعًا وَأَنَابَ,"Then David judged between them and addressed the claimant, saying: “Your brother has wronged you when he asked you to add your ewe to his ewes. And many partners oppress one another by taking their rights and not being fair, except the believers who do good actions, for they are fair with their partners and do not wrong them. But those attributed with that are few”. And David (peace be upon him) was convinced that I only put him to test through this dispute, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord and prostrated to get close to Him, and repented to Him."
So We forgave him. He has surely a high rank with Us and an excellent place of return.,24,38,فَغَفَرْنَا لَهُۥ ذَٰلِكَ وَإِنَّ لَهُۥ عِندَنَا لَزُلْفَىٰ وَحُسْنَ مَـَٔابٍ,"So I responded to him and forgave him that. And he is amongst the close ones with Me, and for him is a good return in the Afterlife."
"""O David, We have made you trustee on the earth. So judge between men equitably, and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of God. Surely for those who go astray from the way of God, is severe punishment, for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning.",25,38,يَٰدَاوُۥدُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَٰكَ خَلِيفَةً فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلَا تَتَّبِعِ ٱلْهَوَىٰ فَيُضِلَّكَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَضِلُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌۢ بِمَا نَسُوا۟ يَوْمَ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"O David, I made you a deputy on earth to execute worldly and religious rulings and judgments, so judge between people with justice. And do not follow desires in your judgement between people, by inclining towards one of the disputants due to relationship or friendship, or by turning away from him due to enmity, whereby desires will misguide you from Allah’s straight path. Those who go astray from Allah’s straight path will have a severe punishment due to their forgetting the day of reckoning, because if they were to remember it and fear it they would not incline to their desires."
"We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, all for nothing. Only those who deny imagine so. So for the unbelievers there is woe from the fire.",26,38,وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَٰطِلًا ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,"And I did not create the heavens or the earth in vain, but rather I created them out of complete wisdom to prove the power of Allah and so that He is obeyed in them. That is the belief of those who deny the truth who believe they were created in vain. So woe to these disbelievers who believe this from the fire of hell on the Day of Judgment, when they die on the disbelief and bad opinion of Allah they are upon."
Should We equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land? Should We make those who are morally integrated equal to those who seek disintegration?,27,38,أَمْ نَجْعَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ كَٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ كَٱلْفُجَّارِ,"I will never make those who believe in Allah, follow His messenger and do good deeds like those who make the corruption on earth through disbelief and sins, nor will I make those who are mindful of their Lord by carrying out His orders and refraining from His prohibitions like the disbelievers and hypocrites who are engrossed in sins. Making them both equal is an injustice which does not befit Allah. But rather Allah will reward the pious believers by entry into Paradise and punish the wretched disbelievers by entry into the fire, because they are not equal in Allah’s sight so their reward is not equal in His sight too."
"We have sent down a Book to you which is blessed, so that people may apply their minds to its revelations, and the men of wisdom may reflect.",28,38,كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَٰرَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوٓا۟ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"This Qur’ān is a book I revealed to you, O Prophet, abundant in good and benefit. I revealed it so that people ponder over its verses and contemplate its meanings, and so that the people of enlightened superior intellect take lessons from it."
"We bestowed Solomon on David who was an excellent devotee, for he turned to God in penitence.",29,38,وَوَهَبْنَا لِدَاوُۥدَ سُلَيْمَٰنَ نِعْمَ ٱلْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُۥٓ أَوَّابٌ,"And I granted David his son Solomon, as a favour from Me to him and a grace so that he is pleased. What an excellent servant Solomon was. He would abundantly repent and turn to Allah."
"When they brought fleet-footed chargers in the evening to show him,",30,38,إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِٱلْعَشِىِّ ٱلصَّٰفِنَٰتُ ٱلْجِيَادُ,"Remember when at the time of Asr purebred fast horses were presented to him, standing on three feet with one foot raised. These purebred horses continued to be presented to him until sunset."
"He said: ""The love of horses is worthy of desire to me for the remembrance of my Lord;"" and when they were out of sight, (he said):",31,38,فَقَالَ إِنِّىٓ أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ ٱلْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّى حَتَّىٰ تَوَارَتْ بِٱلْحِجَابِ,"So Solomon said: “I preferred love of wealth, these horses being part of it, over the remembrance of my Lord until the sun set."
"""Bring them back to me,"" and he began to rub and stroke their shanks and necks.",32,38,رُدُّوهَا عَلَىَّ فَطَفِقَ مَسْحًۢا بِٱلسُّوقِ وَٱلْأَعْنَاقِ,"Return these horses to me”. So they returned them to him, then he began striking their legs and necks with his sword."
"We surely tried Solomon, and placed another body on his throne. So he turned to God",33,38,وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا سُلَيْمَٰنَ وَأَلْقَيْنَا عَلَىٰ كُرْسِيِّهِۦ جَسَدًا ثُمَّ أَنَابَ,"And I tested Solomon and put on his chair part of a child, and that was when he swore by Allah that he will sleep with all of his wives and each one of them will bring forth a horseman to strive in Allah’s way. But he did not say in this oath of his: “if Allah wills”. So he slept with all of them, but none of them gave birth except one who gave birth to part of a child. Then Solomon repented to his Lord."
"Saying: ""O Lord, forgive me, and give me such a dominion as none will merit after me. You are the great bestower.""",34,38,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِى وَهَبْ لِى مُلْكًا لَّا يَنۢبَغِى لِأَحَدٍ مِّنۢ بَعْدِىٓ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,"Solomon said: “My Lord, forgive me my sins and grant me a kingdom especially for me which no person will have after me. My Lord, You give abundantly and are very generous”."
So we subjugated the wind to his service which carried his merchandise wheresoever he wished;,35,38,فَسَخَّرْنَا لَهُ ٱلرِّيحَ تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِۦ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ,"So I responded to him and made the wind subservient to him. It would obey his order, gently. There was no shaking in it, despite its strength and its fast movement. It would carry him wherever he wanted."
"And the devils -- the builders and divers of all kinds,",36,38,وَٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّآءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ,"And I made the satans subservient to him, complying with his orders. Some of them were builders and others were divers who would dive into the seas and take out pearls from them."
And many others bound in bond.,37,38,وَءَاخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِى ٱلْأَصْفَادِ,"And from the satans there were rebellious ones who were made subservient for him. They were tied up in shackles, unable to move."
"""This is Our gift,"" (We said to him), ""so bestow freely or withhold without reckoning.""",38,38,هَٰذَا عَطَآؤُنَا فَٱمْنُنْ أَوْ أَمْسِكْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"“O Solomon, this is My gift which I granted you in response to what you asked of Me. So give whom you want and stop from whom you want, as I will not take you to account in your giving or holding back”."
He has a high position with Us and an excellent abode.,39,38,وَإِنَّ لَهُۥ عِندَنَا لَزُلْفَىٰ وَحُسْنَ مَـَٔابٍ,"And Solomon is amongst the close ones with us, and he has a good return which he will return to, and it is Paradise."
"Remember Our votary Job because he called to his Lord: ""Satan has afflicted me with disease and distress.""",40,38,وَٱذْكُرْ عَبْدَنَآ أَيُّوبَ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥٓ أَنِّى مَسَّنِىَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ بِنُصْبٍ وَعَذَابٍ,"O Messenger, remember My servant Job when he called upon Allah, his Lord: “The satan has afflicted Me with a tiring and tormentful matter”."
"""Go swiftly to the spring,"" (We said). ""This cold water is for bathing and for drinking.""",41,38,ٱرْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَٰذَا مُغْتَسَلٌۢ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ,"So I said to him: “Strike your foot on the ground”. So he struck his foot on the ground, then water sprung forth for him from it, which he would drink and bathe from and through it, his difficulty and pain would go."
"We restored his family to him with others similar to them, as a blessing from Us and a reminder for men of wisdom. --",42,38,وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُۥٓ أَهْلَهُۥ وَمِثْلَهُم مَّعَهُمْ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَذِكْرَىٰ لِأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"So I responded to him and removed the difficulty he was affected by, and I gave him his family and added to them a like number of sons and grandsons, as a mercy from Me to him and a reward for his patience, and so that the people of superior intellect are reminded that the outcome of patience is ease and reward."
"""Take a handful of herbs,"" (We said to him), and apply and rub them, and do not make a mistake."" We found him patient in adversity, an excellent devotee, always turning in repentance.",43,38,وَخُذْ بِيَدِكَ ضِغْثًا فَٱضْرِب بِّهِۦ وَلَا تَحْنَثْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَٰهُ صَابِرًا نِّعْمَ ٱلْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُۥٓ أَوَّابٌ,"When Job became angry with his wife, he swore an oath he will lash her a hundred times, so I said to him: “O Job, take a bunch of stalks in your hand and hit her with them, to fulfil your oath. And do not break the oath you made”. So he took a bunch of stalks and hit her with them. I found him to be patient in what I afflicted him with. What an excellent servant he was. He would turn to Allah abundantly."
"Remember Our votaries Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of power and insight.",44,38,وَٱذْكُرْ عِبَٰدَنَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسْحَٰقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ أُو۟لِى ٱلْأَيْدِى وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرِ,"O Messenger, remember My servants I chose and the messengers I sent: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They were people of strength in Allah’s obedience and seeking His pleasure, and they were people of true insight into the truth."
We distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode (of the Hereafter).,45,38,إِنَّآ أَخْلَصْنَٰهُم بِخَالِصَةٍ ذِكْرَى ٱلدَّارِ,"I favoured them with a special favour I chose them with, which was filling their hearts with the remembrance of the abode of the Afterlife, preparing for it through good actions and calling people towards acting for it."
"They are the chosen ones, the excellent in Our sight.",46,38,وَإِنَّهُمْ عِندَنَا لَمِنَ ٱلْمُصْطَفَيْنَ ٱلْأَخْيَارِ,"And they were with Me amongst those I chose for My obedience and worship, and whom I selected to bear My message and convey it to the people."
"And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. Every one of them is among the best.",47,38,وَٱذْكُرْ إِسْمَٰعِيلَ وَٱلْيَسَعَ وَذَا ٱلْكِفْلِ وَكُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلْأَخْيَارِ,"O Prophet, remember Ishmael, the son of Abraham, and remember Elisha, and remember Dhul-Kifl, and praise them well as they deserve it. And all of these were amongst the chosen and selected in Allah’s sight."
This is a commemoration. Surely for those who take heed for themselves is an excellent place of return --,48,38,هَٰذَا ذِكْرٌ وَإِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ لَحُسْنَ مَـَٔابٍ,This is a reminder of these people through good praise in the Qur’ān. And for the Mindful through carrying out the orders of Allah and refraining from His prohibitions is a good return in the abode of the Afterlife.
"Gardens of Eden with gates open wide to them,",49,38,جَنَّٰتِ عَدْنٍ مُّفَتَّحَةً لَّهُمُ ٱلْأَبْوَٰبُ,"This good return is gardens of residence they will enter on the Day of Judgment, whose doors will be opened to welcome them."
"Where they will take their ease, calling for fruits in plenty, and for wine,",50,38,مُتَّكِـِٔينَ فِيهَا يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِفَٰكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ وَشَرَابٍ,"Reclining on couches which will be adorned for them. They will ask their attendants to present to them the many different types of fruit they will desire and the drinks they will desire, such as wine and so forth."
"With companions of modest look, the same in age, by their side.",51,38,وَعِندَهُمْ قَٰصِرَٰتُ ٱلطَّرْفِ أَتْرَابٌ,"And with them will be women, all of similar age, whose gaze will be limited only to their husbands."
This is what is promised you for the Day of Reckoning.,52,38,هَٰذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"O Alah-conscious people, this is the pleasant reward you are being promised on the day of judgment for your good deeds you used to do in the world."
This is surely Our provision never-ending.,53,38,إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَرِزْقُنَا مَا لَهُۥ مِن نَّفَادٍ,"This reward I have mentioned is My provision I will give to the Alah-conscious on the Day of Judgment, and it is continuous provision which will not pause or end."
"This (for the virtuous); but for the transgressors the evil destination,",54,38,هَٰذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّٰغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَٔابٍ,"This that I mentioned is the reward of the Mindful. And those who trespass the limits of Allah through disbelief and sins will have a reward different to that of the Mindful, so for them is a bad return they shall return to on the day of judgment."
"Hell, in which they will burn. How vile a resting place!",55,38,جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,"This reward is hell which will surround them, and they will suffer its heat and flames. From it they will have a spread, so what an evil spread is theirs."
"There will be boiling water for them and cold, clammy, fetid drink to taste,",56,38,هَٰذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ,"This punishment is extremely hot water, and pus which will flow from the bodies of the people of hell being punished in it, so they should taste it as it is their drink. However it is a drink which does not quench thirst."
And other similar torments.,57,38,وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِۦٓ أَزْوَٰجٌ,And they will have another punishment like this punishment. They will have a number of various punishments they will be punished with in the Afterlife.
Here is a multitude rushing headlong with you. There is no welcome for them. They will roast in the fire.,58,38,هَٰذَا فَوْجٌ مُّقْتَحِمٌ مَّعَكُمْ لَا مَرْحَبًۢا بِهِمْ إِنَّهُمْ صَالُوا۟ ٱلنَّارِ,"And when the people of hellfire will enter, they will dispute with one another, cursing and disassociating from one another. When it will be said to those already in the fire: “This is a new group of those that will inhabit the fire with you, they will respond:” “May they not be welcome, they will suffer the punishment like we are suffering”"
"They will say: ""In fact, it is you who will have no welcome. It is you who brought this upon us. What an evil place of rest!""",59,38,قَالُوا۟ بَلْ أَنتُمْ لَا مَرْحَبًۢا بِكُمْ أَنتُمْ قَدَّمْتُمُوهُ لَنَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرَارُ,"The group of followers will say to their leaders who were followed: “But rather you, O leaders who were followed, no welcome to you, as you are what caused us this painful punishment by misguiding us and leading us astray”. What a terrible settlement this is, the settlement of hell fire for them all."
"They will say: ""O Lord, give him who has brought this upon us two times more the torment of Hell;""",60,38,قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَا مَن قَدَّمَ لَنَا هَٰذَا فَزِدْهُ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا فِى ٱلنَّارِ,"The followers will say: “Our Lord, whoever lead us astray from the guidance after it came to us, double his punishment in the fire”."
"And will add: ""O what has happened to us that we do not see the men we counted among the wicked.",61,38,وَقَالُوا۟ مَا لَنَا لَا نَرَىٰ رِجَالًا كُنَّا نَعُدُّهُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَشْرَارِ,And the arrogant transgressors will say: “Why do we not see with us in the fire men we used to consider in the world amongst the wretched who deserved punishment?
"Did we laugh at them (for nothing), or our eyes fail to pick them out?""",62,38,أَتَّخَذْنَٰهُمْ سِخْرِيًّا أَمْ زَاغَتْ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْأَبْصَٰرُ,"Was our mocking them a mistake and so they did not deserve to be punished, or was our mocking them right, and they have entered the fire but we have not seen them yet?”"
This contending of the inmates of Hell will surely be real.,63,38,إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ لَحَقٌّ تَخَاصُمُ أَهْلِ ٱلنَّارِ,"This which has been mentioned to you, namely the arguments of the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment, is the truth in which there is no dispute or doubt."
"Say: ""I am only a warner, and there is no other god but God, the one, the omnipotent,",64,38,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ مُنذِرٌ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَٰحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,"O Muhammad, say to the disbelievers from your people: “I am only a warner to you of Allah’s punishment, lest it fall upon you due to disbelief and denying His messengers. And there is no god who deserves to be worshipped besides Allah, as He is unique in His greatness, qualities and names, and He is the Subduer who has subdued everything. So everything submits to Him."
"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, all-mighty, all-forgiving.""",65,38,رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفَّٰرُ,"And He is the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth and Lord of whatever is in between them. And He is Mighty in His kingdom, with nobody to overpower Him, and He is Forgiving of the sins of His servants who repent to Him”."
"Say: ""This is a momentous message,",66,38,قُلْ هُوَ نَبَؤٌا۟ عَظِيمٌ,"O Messenger, say to these deniers: “The Qur’ān is a news of great status."
To which you pay no heed.,67,38,أَنتُمْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضُونَ,You are turning away from this news of great status; you do not turn towards it.
I had no knowledge of the higher Assembly when they discussed it among themselves.,68,38,مَا كَانَ لِىَ مِنْ عِلْمٍۭ بِٱلْمَلَإِ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰٓ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"I do not have knowledge of the discussion between the angels regarding the creation of Adam, if Allah had not revealed to me and taught me."
Only this has been revealed to me that I am a distinct warner.,69,38,إِن يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ إِلَّآ أَنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Allah only reveals to me what He reveals, and I am a clear warner to you of His punishment”."
"When your Lord said to the angels: ""I am going to create a man from clay;",70,38,إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنِّى خَٰلِقٌۢ بَشَرًا مِّن طِينٍ,"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: “I am going to create a man from clay, and he is Adam (peace be upon him)."
"And when I have made him and have breathed into him of My spirit. Fall down in homage before him.""",71,38,فَإِذَا سَوَّيْتُهُۥ وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِى فَقَعُوا۟ لَهُۥ سَٰجِدِينَ,"So once I have proportioned his form, made his appearance right and blown My spirit into him, prostrate to him”."
"Then the angels bowed before him in a body,",72,38,فَسَجَدَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ,"So the angels obeyed the command of their Lord, so all of them prostrated by way of greeting and honour, and none of them remained except that they prostrated to Adam."
Except Iblis. He was filled with pride and turned an unbeliever.,73,38,إِلَّآ إِبْلِيسَ ٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Besides Iblis who was too arrogant to prostrate. And through his being arrogant to the command of his Lord, he was from the disbelievers."
"Said (God): ""O Iblis, what hindered you from adoring what I created by My own authority? Are you too proud, or too high and mighty?""",74,38,قَالَ يَٰٓإِبْلِيسُ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَن تَسْجُدَ لِمَا خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَىَّ أَسْتَكْبَرْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْعَالِينَ,"Allah said: “O Iblis, what stopped you from prostrating to Adam whom I created with My hands? Did pride stop you from prostrating or were you arrogant and haughty over your Lord from before?”"
"He said: ""I am better than he. You created me from fire, and him from clay.""",75,38,قَالَ أَنَا۠ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِى مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُۥ مِن طِينٍ,Iblis said: “I am better than Adam. You created me from fire and you created him from clay. And fire is a more noble substance than clay”.
"(God) said: ""Then go hence, ostracised.",76,38,قَالَ فَٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّكَ رَجِيمٌ,"Allah said to Iblis: “Get out of Paradise, because you are accursed and reviled."
"Upon you will be My damnation till the Day of Doom.""",77,38,وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكَ لَعْنَتِىٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,"And you are to be rejected from Paradise until the day of recompense, which is the day of judgment”."
"He said: ""O Lord, give me respite till the day the dead rise from their graves.""",78,38,قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرْنِىٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,Iblis said: “Give me respite and do not make me die until the day You raise Your servants”.
"(God) said: ""You have the respite",79,38,قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ,Allah said: “You are amongst those given respite.
"Till the appointed day.""",80,38,إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْوَقْتِ ٱلْمَعْلُومِ,Until the day of the known time which is fixed for your destruction”.
"He said: ""By Your authority, I will lead them astray,",81,38,قَالَ فَبِعِزَّتِكَ لَأُغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,Iblis said: “I swear by Your power and domination that I shall misguide all of the children of Adam.
"Other than the chosen ones among Your creatures.""",82,38,إِلَّا عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,Except whom You protect from my misguiding and You have chosen to worship You alone”.
"(God) said: ""This is right by Me, and what I say is right.",83,38,قَالَ فَٱلْحَقُّ وَٱلْحَقَّ أَقُولُ,Allah said: “The truth is from Me and the truth is what I say. I do not say anything besides it.
"I will fill up Hell with you together with those who follow you.""",84,38,لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكَ وَمِمَّن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"On the Day of Judgment, I shall fill hell with you and your children, O Iblis, and those from the children of Adam who follow you in your disbelief, all of you”."
"Say: ""I do not ask any compensation of you for it, nor am I a specious pretender.",85,38,قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: “I do not ask you for any reward for the advice I convey to you, and I am not of the pretentious by bringing more than what I have been ordered with."
This is only a warning for mankind.,86,38,إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,The Qur’ān is only a reminder to those who are accountable amongst men and jinns.
"You will come to know its truth in time.""",87,38,وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ نَبَأَهُۥ بَعْدَ حِينٍۭ,"And you will come to know the news of this Qur’ān and that it is true, after a short time when you die”."
"THE REVELATION OF this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.",0,39,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"The revelation of the Qur’ān is from Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, the Wise in His creating, planning and legislating. It is not revealed from anyone besides Him."
We have revealed to you the Scripture with exactitude; so worship God with devotion all exclusive for Him.,1,39,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَٱعْبُدِ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ,"O Messenger, I revealed the Qur’ān to you which comprises the truth, so all of its news are true and all of its rulings are just. So worship Allah, declaring Him to be One, directing all of your acts of worship to only Him."
"Remember that devotion is exclusively for God. Those who have taken protectors other than Him, say: ""We worship them that they may bring us nearer to God."" Surely God will judge between them in what they are differing about. Verily God does not show the way to an ungrateful liar.",2,39,أَلَا لِلَّهِ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْخَالِصُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِى مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى مَنْ هُوَ كَٰذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ,"Definitely, for Allah is the religion pure of impurities. And those who have taken friends besides Allah, such as idols which they worship besides Allah, presenting an excuse for worshipping them by saying: “We do not worship these except so that they bring us closer to Allah in status, present our needs to Him and intercede on our behalf with Him”. Allah will decide between the monotheist believers and the disbelievers who associate partners with Allah on the day of judgment regarding the oneness of Allah they used to differ in. Allah does not place guidance in the hearts of those who lie against Allah by attributing an associate with Him and who denies Allah’s favours upon him."
"Had God pleased to take a son, He could have chosen whom He liked from among those He has created. Glory be to Him. He is God, the one, the omnipotent.",3,39,لَّوْ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا لَّٱصْطَفَىٰ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَٰحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,"If Allah wanted to take a son, as the idolaters claim, and Allah is far above from what they say - He would have chosen whom He wants from His creation and taken him as a child. Pure and exalted is He from what these idolaters say. He is One in His essence, attributes and actions, having no partner in them, Subduer of all His creation."
"He has created the heavens and the earth with precision. He folds the day up over the night, and folds the night up over the day. He has subjugated the sun and moon, (so that) each runs its appointed course. Is He not all-mighty and forgiving?",4,39,خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ يُكَوِّرُ ٱلَّيْلَ عَلَى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ ٱلنَّهَارَ عَلَى ٱلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى أَلَا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفَّٰرُ,"He created the heavens and He created the earth with complete wisdom, not in vain as the unjust say. He enters the night into the day and the day into the night, so when one of them comes the other disappears. And He has made the sun and the moon subservient, each one orbits to a fixed time, which is the end of this life. Definitely, He is the Mighty who takes retribution from His enemies and nobody can overpower Him, Forgiving of the sins of His servants who repent."
"He created you from a single cell, then from it created its mate; arid provided eight varieties of cattle for you. He formed you in the mother's womb, formation after formation in three (veils of) darkness. He is God your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is no god other than He. How then can you turn away?",5,39,خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَأَنزَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ ثَمَٰنِيَةَ أَزْوَٰجٍ يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ خَلْقًا مِّنۢ بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِى ظُلُمَٰتٍ ثَلَٰثٍ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,"O people, your Lord created you from one soul which is Adam, then He created from Adam his wife Eve. And He created for you eight kinds of animal for your benefit; from camels, cows, sheep and goats, from each type the male and the female. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, stage after stage, in the darkness of the stomach, womb and placenta. He who creates all of that is Allah your Lord. To Him alone belongs the kingdom. There is no true god besides Him, so how do you turn from His worship to worshipping those who create nothing but are created?"
"If you are ungrateful, then remember! God is independent of you, and He does not favour ingratitude on the part of His creatures. If you are grateful He will be pleased with you. For no one who carries a burden bears another's load; and your returning is to your Lord, when He will tell you what you used to do. Surely He knows what is in the hearts.",6,39,إِن تَكْفُرُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِىٌّ عَنكُمْ وَلَا يَرْضَىٰ لِعِبَادِهِ ٱلْكُفْرَ وَإِن تَشْكُرُوا۟ يَرْضَهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُم مَّرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"O people, if you disbelieve in your Lord, then Allah is Self-Sufficient and in no need of your faith. Your disbelief does not harm Him. The harm of your disbelief only returns back to you. And He is not pleased for His servants to disbelieve in Him nor does He order them to disbelieve, because Allah does not order indecency and wrong. And if you thank Allah for His favours and believe in Him, He will be pleased with your gratitude and reward you for it. And no soul will carry the sin of another soul, but every soul will be held back by its own deeds. Then to your Lord alone is your return on the Day of Judgment, then He will inform you of what you used to do in the world and reward you for your actions. He is Knowing of what is in the hearts of His servants; nothing of what is in them is hidden from Him."
"When man is afflicted with adversity he turns to his Lord, and prays to Him. But when He bestows His favour on him, he forgets what he prayed for before, and sets up others as compeers of God to mislead (people) from His way. Say: ""Take advantage of your denying for a while: You will be among the inmates of Hell.""",7,39,وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَا رَبَّهُۥ مُنِيبًا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلَهُۥ نِعْمَةً مِّنْهُ نَسِىَ مَا كَانَ يَدْعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ مِن قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا لِّيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ قُلْ تَمَتَّعْ بِكُفْرِكَ قَلِيلًا إِنَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلنَّارِ,"And when the disbeliever is afflicted by difficulty, such as illness, loss of wealth or fear of drowning, he calls upon his Lord to remove the difficulty which is upon him, turning to Him alone. Then when he grants him a favour by removing the difficulty which afflicted him, he leaves whom he used to beseech before, which is Allah, and he makes for Allah associates which he worships besides Him. O Messenger, say to one whose condition this is: “Enjoy your disbelief for as long as you live, which is a short time, as you are amongst the people of the fire who will be inseparable from it on the Day of Judgment, like a companion is inseparable from his companion”."
"Can one who prays in the watches of the night, bowing in homage or standing attentive, fearful of the life to come, and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (be like one who does not)? Say: ""Can those who know, and those who do not know, be equal? Only they think who are wise.""",8,39,أَمَّنْ هُوَ قَٰنِتٌ ءَانَآءَ ٱلَّيْلِ سَاجِدًا وَقَآئِمًا يَحْذَرُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ وَيَرْجُوا۟ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّهِۦ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"Is one who is obedient to Allah, spending the time at night in prostration to his Lord and standing for Him, fearing the punishment of the Afterlife and hoping in the mercy of his Lord better or that disbeliever who worships Allah in hardship but disbelieves in Him in ease and ascribes parters with Him? O Messenger, say: “Are those who know what Allah has made obligatory upon them due to their understanding of Allah and those who do not know any of this equal?” Only people of sound intelligence recognise the difference between the two."
"Tell them: ""O my creatures who have come to belief, have fear of displeasing your Lord. There is good for those who do good in this world, and productive is God's earth. Only those who persevere will get their reward measureless.""",9,39,قُلْ يَٰعِبَادِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ فِى هَٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ وَأَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَٰسِعَةٌ إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى ٱلصَّٰبِرُونَ أَجْرَهُم بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"O Messenger, say to my servants who have faith in Me and My messengers: “Be mindful of your Lord by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions. For those amongst you who did good actions in the world is good in this world through divine assistance, health and provision, and in the Afterlife through Paradise. And the land of Allah is vast, so migrate therein until you find a place in which you can worship Allah without anything stopping you. The patient will be given their reward on the day of judgment without any counting or limit, due to its abundance and different types”."
"Say: ""I am commanded to worship God with obedience all-exclusive for Him;",10,39,قُلْ إِنِّىٓ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ,"Say, O Messenger: Allah has instructed me to worship Him alone, dedicating my worship to Him. He has instructed me with this and He also instructed those who follow me."
"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit.""",11,39,وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,He has instructed me to be the first of those who surrender and submit to Him from this nation.
"Say: ""If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an evil Day.""",12,39,قُلْ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّى عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"Say, O Messenger: I fear, if I go against Allah and do not follow him, the punishment of a great day, which is the day of resurrection."
"Say: ""I worship God with devotion all-exclusive for Him.",13,39,قُلِ ٱللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُۥ دِينِى,"Say, O Messenger: I worship Allah alone dedicating my worship to Him. I do not worship others with Him."
"You may worship what you will apart from Him."" Say: ""Surely the greatest losers will be those who will lose their own selves and their people on the Day of Resurrection."" Remember, this will be an all-too-evident loss.",14,39,فَٱعْبُدُوا۟ مَا شِئْتُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَلَا ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْخُسْرَانُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"So you, O idolaters, worship whatever idols you wish besides Him (this instruction is a threat). Say, O Messenger:.the true losers are those who will lose themselves and their family members, whom they will not meet in the Hereafter due to them being separated in Paradise and the fire together with them. Thus they will never meet. That is indeed, and undoubtedly the obvious loss."
"Above them will be a covering of fire, below them a cloud (of flames). With this does God warn His creatures: ""O My creatures, fear Me.""",15,39,لَهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَمِن تَحْتِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ ذَٰلِكَ يُخَوِّفُ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ عِبَادَهُۥ يَٰعِبَادِ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"They will have the fire, extreme heat and smoke from above and beneath them there will be smoke, flames and heat. That punishment is what Allah warns His servants of. O My servants, so fear Me by fulfilling My instructions and avoiding My prohibitions."
There are happy tidings for those who keep away from the worship of false gods and turn to God in repentance. Give glad tidings to My creatures.,16,39,وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱجْتَنَبُوا۟ ٱلطَّٰغُوتَ أَن يَعْبُدُوهَا وَأَنَابُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ لَهُمُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ فَبَشِّرْ عِبَادِ,"Those who avoid the worship of idols, and anything else that is worshipped besides Allah, and return to Allah in repentance, they will have the good news of Paradise when they pass away, in the grave and on the day of resurrection. So give good news, O Messenger, to My servants."
"Those who listen to the Word and then follow the best it contains, are the ones who have been guided by God, and are men of wisdom.",17,39,ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَمِعُونَ ٱلْقَوْلَ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ أَحْسَنَهُۥٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمْ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"Those who listen to what is said, distinguish between good and evil, and follow the best speech because of the benefit it contains. Those who possess these attributes are the ones whom Allah has given guidance and they are the ones who have sound intellect."
Can he against whom the sentence of punishment has been justified (be rescued)? Can you save him who is in the Fire?,18,39,أَفَمَنْ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ أَفَأَنتَ تُنقِذُ مَن فِى ٱلنَّارِ,"Those for whom the word of punishment is binding due to their persistence in their disbelief and deviation, you, O Messenger, have no means to guide them. Are you, O Messenger, able to rescue such people from the Fire?"
"But for those who fear displeasing their Lord there are lofty mansions built above mansions, with rivers rippling past below them: A promise of God; (and) God does not go back on His promise.",19,39,لَٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ غُرَفٌ مِّن فَوْقِهَا غُرَفٌ مَّبْنِيَّةٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ لَا يُخْلِفُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"But those who are mindful of their Lord, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, they will have lofty dwellings, one above the other, underneath which rivers flow. Allah has made a firm promise of this to them and Allah does not break His promise. He is far above that."
"Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, then makes it flow in rills on the earth, and brings forth corn from it which, having passed through changes of shade and colour, comes to ripen, and you see it autumnal yellow; then He reduces it to chaff. There are indeed lessons in this for those who are wise.",20,39,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَلَكَهُۥ يَنَٰبِيعَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يُخْرِجُ بِهِۦ زَرْعًا مُّخْتَلِفًا أَلْوَٰنُهُۥ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَىٰهُ مُصْفَرًّا ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُۥ حُطَٰمًا إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,"You are well aware, by having seen, that Allah sent down rain water from the sky, entered it into the earth and then brought it out as springs and rivers. Then with this water He produces crops of various colours. Then these crops become dry and you - who are witnessing this - see them turning yellow after having been green. Then, after they become dry, He makes them into fragmented pieces. In what has been mentioned there is a reminder for those who have hearts that are alive."
Will he whose breast has been opened up to peace (not be) in luminescence from his Lord? Alas for those whose hearts have been hardened to God's remembrance! They wander (astray) in clear error.,21,39,أَفَمَن شَرَحَ ٱللَّهُ صَدْرَهُۥ لِلْإِسْلَٰمِ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْقَٰسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُم مِّن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Then is the person whose heart Allah has opened to Islam and he is guided to it with insight from his Lord, like the one whose heart is hardened against Allah’s remembrance? They can never be equal. Salvation is for those who are guided and loss is for those whose hearts are hardened against Allah’s remembrance. Such people are in clear misguidance from the truth."
"God has sent down the very best discourse, the Book conformable in its juxtapositions, which makes all of those who fear their Lord, shudder. So their hearts and bodies become receptive to the remembrance of God. This is the guidance of God with which He guides whosoever He will; but whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.",22,39,ٱللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْحَدِيثِ كِتَٰبًا مُّتَشَٰبِهًا مَّثَانِىَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْ هَادٍ,"Allah sent down to His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Qur’ān which is the best speech. He sent it down in a manner that part of it resembles other parts in their truthfulness, beauty and consistency without disagreement. It contains numerous stories and rulings, promises and threats, attributes of the people of truth, attributes of the people of falsehood etc. The skins of those who are in awe of their Lord tremble when they hear the threats and warnings it contains. Then their skins and their hearts soften to Allah’s remembrance when they hear the hope and good news it contains. What has been mentioned, about the Qur’ān and its effect, is Allah’s guidance by which He guides whoever He wills. Those whom Allah leaves astray and does not guide, have no one to guide them."
"Can he who will have to shield himself against the torment of the Day of Resurrection (be the same as one at peace)? The evil-doers will be told: ""So taste what you earned.""",23,39,أَفَمَن يَتَّقِى بِوَجْهِهِۦ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَقِيلَ لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ ذُوقُوا۟ مَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,"Is the person whom Allah guided, blessed in the world and entered him into Paradise in the Hereafter equal to the person who disbelieved and died as a disbeliever, and as a result was entered into the Fire with his hands and feet tied, unable to protect himself against the Fire except by his face that he falls on?! Those who wronged themselves by disbelief and sins will be told by way of reproach: Taste the disbelief and sins that you used to earn, for this is your recompense."
"Those before them had denied, then punishment had overtaken them is from a quarter they did not suspect.",24,39,كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَىٰهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"The nations that were before these idolaters also denied, and thus the punishment came to them suddenly from where they did not perceive so as to prepare for it by repentance."
"Then God made them taste of disgrace in this life; and the torment of the life to come is greater, if they understand.",25,39,فَأَذَاقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخِزْىَ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"By this punishment Allah made them taste humiliation, disgrace and shame in the worldly life. The punishment of the Hereafter that awaits them is worse and more severe if they only knew."
We have given examples of every kind for men in this Qur'an so that they may contemplate:,26,39,وَلَقَدْ ضَرَبْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِى هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"In this Qur’ān revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) I have given people various examples of good and evil, truth and falsehood, faith and disbelief etc. in the hope that they will take a lesson from these examples and act on the truth leaving out falsehood."
"A clear discourse which expounds all things without any obliquity, so that they may take heed for themselves.",27,39,قُرْءَانًا عَرَبِيًّا غَيْرَ ذِى عِوَجٍ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"I made it a Qur’ān in the Arabic language, without any defect, deviation or confusion, in the hope that they will become mindful of Allah, by following His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"God advances the example of a man who is owned (as slave in common) by a number of men at loggerheads, and another man who is owned by only one. Are these two alike in attribute? God be praised; yet many of them do not know.",28,39,ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلًا فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ مُتَشَٰكِسُونَ وَرَجُلًا سَلَمًا لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah gave the example of an idolater and a monotheist as that of a man owned by disputing partners - if he pleases some he angers others and he is thus confused and disturbed; and of a man who is devoted to one man alone who owns him and whose intentions he knows - he is thus comfortable and calm. These two men are not the same. Praise be to Allah, but most of them do not know and therefore they ascribe others as partners to Allah."
"Verily you will die, and so will they.",29,39,إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ,"You, O Messenger, will certainly pass away and they will too."
Then on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute before your Lord.,30,39,ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ تَخْتَصِمُونَ,"Then you, O people, on the Day of Resurrection will dispute amongst yourselves before your Lord, over that which you disagree with one another, and it will become clear who is right and who is wrong."
"Who does greater wrong than he who tells a lie against God, and denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there no place for unbelievers in Hell?",31,39,فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَبَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَذَّبَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ إِذْ جَآءَهُۥٓ أَلَيْسَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"There is no one more wrong than the person who attributes to Allah what is not appropriate for Him, such as a partner, spouse or child, and who denies the Qur’ān. There is no one more wrong than the person who rejects the truth that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) brought. Is there not in the Fire an abode and home for those who reject Allah and what His Messenger brought? Indeed, there is an abode and home for them there."
"He who brings the truth and verifies it, -- such are the people who are God-fearing.",32,39,وَٱلَّذِى جَآءَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ وَصَدَّقَ بِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,"The prophets and those who brought truth in speech and action, and those who had faith in it, acting according to it, they are the ones who are truly God fearing, who fulfil the instruction of their Lord and avoid His prohibition."
"They shall have what they wish from their Lord. This is the recompense for the good,",33,39,لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ ذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,They will have all the everlasting pleasures they wish for by their Lord. That is the reward of those who do good deeds sincerely for their Creator and they spread good amongst His servants.
That God may absolve them of their sins and reward them for the best that they had done.,34,39,لِيُكَفِّرَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ أَسْوَأَ ٱلَّذِى عَمِلُوا۟ وَيَجْزِيَهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ ٱلَّذِى كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"So that Allah erases from them the worst sins that they used to do in the world, as they had repented from them and had turned towards their Lord, and rewards them according to the best deeds that they used to do."
Is not God sufficient for His devotee? Still they frighten you with others apart from Him. Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.,35,39,أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُۥ وَيُخَوِّفُونَكَ بِٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِۦ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْ هَادٍ,"Is Allah not sufficient for His servant, Muhammad (peace be upon him), in his religious and worldly matters and to ward off his enemy? Indeed, He is sufficient. They frighten you, O Messenger, because of their ignorance and foolishness, with the idols that they worship besides Allah, that they will harm you. Those whom Allah abandons and does not bless with guidance, will have no one to guide them."
"And none can lead him astray who has been guided by God. Is not God all-mighty, the lord of retribution?",36,39,وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِن مُّضِلٍّ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِعَزِيزٍ ذِى ٱنتِقَامٍ,"Whoever Allah blesses with guidance, there will be no one able to mislead them. Is Allah not Mighty, whom no one can challenge, and One who takes retribution from those who reject and go against Him? Indeed, He is Mighty and one who takes retribution."
"If you ask them, ""Who created the heavens and the earth?"" they will answer: ""God."" Say: ""Then just think. Can those whom you worship apart from God remove the distress God is pleased to visit upon me, or withhold a blessing God is pleased to favour me with?' Say: ""God is all-sufficient for me. The trusting place their trust in Him.""",37,39,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَنِىَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ هَلْ هُنَّ كَٰشِفَٰتُ ضُرِّهِۦٓ أَوْ أَرَادَنِى بِرَحْمَةٍ هَلْ هُنَّ مُمْسِكَٰتُ رَحْمَتِهِۦ قُلْ حَسْبِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ يَتَوَكَّلُ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,"O Messenger! If you ask these idolaters, “Who created the heavens and who created the earth?” they will say, “Allah created them.” Say to them, to show them the inability of their gods: Tell me about these idols that you worship besides Allah. If Allah willed to harm me, do they have the power to remove that harm from me? Or if my Lord wished to grant me mercy from Him, are they able to stop His mercy from me? Say to them: Allah alone is enough for me. It is on Him that I rely in all my affairs. it is on Him alone those who want to place their reliance entrust their affairs to."
"Say: ""O people, act as best you can on your part, I am acting too. You will come to know in time",38,39,قُلْ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّى عَٰمِلٌ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: O my people, continue to act in that state of ascribing partners to Allah that you have chosen, and I will continue to act on what my Lord has instructed me, by calling towards His Oneness and by devoting my worship to Him. Soon you will come to know the outcome of each path."
"Who suffers the shameful punishment, and on whom falls the everlasting torment.",39,39,مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَيَحِلُّ عَلَيْهِ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,"Soon you will come to know who will be punished in this world in a way that disgraces and humiliates them, and upon whom an everlasting permanent punishment will come in the Hereafter."
"We have Sent down this Book to you with the truth for all mankind. So, he who comes to guidance does so for himself, and he who goes astray does so for his own loss; on you does not lie their guardianship.",40,39,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ لِلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَلِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ,"I sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’ān for people with the truth for you to warn them. Whoever follows guidance then the benefit of his guidance is only for his own self. Allah does not benefit from his guidance as He is in no need of it. Whoever strays then the harm of his straying is to his own detriment. Allah is not harmed by his straying. You are not in charge of them so as to force guidance on them. Your duty is only to convey to them what you have been instructed to convey."
"God gathers up the souls of those who die, and of those who do not die, in their sleep; then He keeps back those ordained for death, and sends the others back for an appointed term. Surely there are signs in this for those who reflect.",41,39,ٱللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلْأَنفُسَ حِينَ مَوْتِهَا وَٱلَّتِى لَمْ تَمُتْ فِى مَنَامِهَا فَيُمْسِكُ ٱلَّتِى قَضَىٰ عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَوْتَ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلْأُخْرَىٰٓ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"Allah is the one who takes away the souls when their term ends. He also takes the souls whose term has not ended when they sleep. He then withholds those for whom He has decreed death and releases those for whom He has not decreed death until a time that is fixed in His knowledge, (may He be glorified). In this taking away, release, giving of death and life there are indications for a people who reflect on the fact that the one who does this is able to resurrect people after their death for reckoning and recompense."
"Have they appointed intercessors other than God? Say: ""Even though they have no power in the least, nor do they understand?""",42,39,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ شُفَعَآءَ قُلْ أَوَلَوْ كَانُوا۟ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"The idolaters took their idols as intercessors, having hope of benefit in them instead of Allah. Say to them, O Messenger: Do you take them as intercessors even though they have no power to do anything for you or for themselves and they do not have understanding? They are lifeless objects that cannot speak, hear, see, benefit or harm."
"Say: ""God's is the intercession entirely; His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then to Him you will return.""",43,39,قُل لِّلَّهِ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةُ جَمِيعًا لَّهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Say - O Messenger, to these idolaters: All intercession belongs to Allah alone. No one can intercede before Him except with His permission and the intercession can only be for those whom He approves. The control of the heavens and the control of the earth belongs to Him alone. Then to Him alone you will return on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning and recompense, and He will give you the requital of your actions."
"When God alone is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come, are filled with resentment. But when others are mentioned apart from God, they begin to rejoice.",44,39,وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ ٱشْمَأَزَّتْ قُلُوبُ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,"Whenever Allah is mentioned on His own, the hearts of the idolaters who do not believe in the Hereafter and the resurrection, reckoning and recompense that will take place therein, become averse. But when the idols that they worship other than Allah are mentioned they become happy and joyful."
"Say: ""O God, the originator of the heavens and the earth, the knower of the unknown and the known, You alone will judge between Your creatures for things they differed about.""",45,39,قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ عَٰلِمَ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ أَنتَ تَحْكُمُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِى مَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Say, O Messenger: O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth without any precedent, Knower of what is absent and what is present! Nothing of that is hidden from You. You alone will decide between Your servants on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to differ in the world, and it will become clear who is right and who is wrong and who is fortunate and who is not."
"Even if the sinners possessed whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and as much more, they would offer it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection; yet what they did not even imagine would appear to them from God;",46,39,وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُۥ مَعَهُۥ لَٱفْتَدَوْا۟ بِهِۦ مِن سُوٓءِ ٱلْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَبَدَا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ يَحْتَسِبُونَ,"If those who wronged themselves, by worshipping other than Allah and committing sins, could have all of the wealth and treasures on this earth to ransom themselves from the severe punishment on the day of resurrection, they would do so. However even if they did, the ransom would not be accepted from them. Rather they will face from Allah various types of torment they never used to expect"
And the evil of what they had earned would become visible to them; and what they used to mock would surround them from all sides.,47,39,وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتُ مَا كَسَبُوا۟ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"The evils of the idolatry and sins that they committed will appear to them and the punishment that they were warned of in the world, which they mocked at, will surround them."
"When a man is in trouble, he prays to God; but when We bestow a favour on him he says: ""It has come to me through my acumen."" In fact, this is an illusion, but most men do not know.",48,39,فَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَٰهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُۥ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍۭ بَلْ هِىَ فِتْنَةٌ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"When a disbelieving man is afflicted by sickness, poverty etc. he calls out to Me to remove his affliction. Then when I bless him with health or wealth, the disbeliever says: Allah has only given me this because He knows that I deserve it. Actually it is a test and a means of luring him to his destruction. But most disbelievers do not know this and they are deceived by the blessings Allah gives them."
"Those before them had also said so, and yet nothing of what they did availed them in the least.",49,39,قَدْ قَالَهَا ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"This statement was made by the disbelievers before them, but the wealth and status they earned was of no use to them at all."
Then the worst of what they had done overtook them. So will the evil deeds of those who are sinners among them recoil back on them. They cannot get the better (of Us).,50,39,فَأَصَابَهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتُ مَا كَسَبُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ سَيُصِيبُهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتُ مَا كَسَبُوا۟ وَمَا هُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,"The recompense for the evils of idolatry and sins that they committed caught up with them. Those who wronged themselves by idolatry and sins, from these who are present, will also be caught up by the recompense for the evils of what they committed just like those in the past. They will not escape from Allah nor defeat Him."
Do they not know that God enhances or restricts the provision of any one He will. Surely there are signs in this for people who believe.,51,39,أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Do these idolaters say this and not know that Allah expands the provision for whoever He wills as a test for him: Is he grateful or ungrateful? And he narrows it for whoever he wills as a test for him: Is he patient or does he become angry with Allah’s decree. In what has been mentioned, about the expansion and narrowing of provision, there are indications of Allah’s planning for a people who believe, because they are the ones who benefit from such indications. The disbelievers on the other hand pass by them without paying any attention to them."
"Say: ""O creatures of God, those of you who have acted against your own interests should not be disheartened of the mercy of God. Surely God forgives all sins. He is all-forgiving and all-merciful.",52,39,قُلْ يَٰعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا۟ مِن رَّحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Say - O Messenger, to My servants who have gone beyond the limit against themselves by ascribing partners to Allah and committing sins: Do not lose hope of Allah’s mercy and of His forgiveness for your sins. Allah forgives all the sins of those who repent to Him. He is the Forgiving towards the sins of those who repent and the Merciful towards them."
Turn towards your Lord and obey Him before the punishment comes upon you when you will not be helped.,53,39,وَأَنِيبُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا۟ لَهُۥ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ,"Return to your Lord by repentance and righteous actions and submit to Him, before the punishment comes to you on the day of resurrection. Then you will not find anyone from your idols and families to help you by rescuing you from the punishment."
"Follow the best of what has been revealed to you by your Lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly and you are caught unawares,",54,39,وَٱتَّبِعُوٓا۟ أَحْسَنَ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بَغْتَةً وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ,"Follow the Qur’ān, which is the best of what your Lord has revealed to His Messenger. Act on its instructions and avoid its prohibitions, before the punishment comes to you suddenly while you are unaware of it so as to prepare for it by repentance."
"Lest a soul should say: ""Alas, I was heedless of God and only laughed;""",55,39,أَن تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يَٰحَسْرَتَىٰ عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطتُ فِى جَنۢبِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن كُنتُ لَمِنَ ٱلسَّٰخِرِينَ,"Act now to avoid the soul's extreme regret when it will declare on the day of resurrection: Alas my grief over my negligence in my duty to Allah by the disbelief and sins committed, and the mocking of the people of faith and obedience in the world."
"Or say: ""If only God had guided me I would have been a man of fear and piety;""",56,39,أَوْ تَقُولَ لَوْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هَدَىٰنِى لَكُنتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Or it will attempt to justify itself through the argument of fate and say: If Allah had guided me I would have been one of those who are mindful of him, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"Or say on seeing the punishment: ""If I could only return I would be among the good.""",57,39,أَوْ تَقُولَ حِينَ تَرَى ٱلْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِى كَرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Or it will say when it will see the punishment, wishing: If only I could return to the world and repent to Allah, and be one of those who do good deeds."
"Why, My revelations had come to you, but you denied them and were filled with pride, and were among the disbelievers.",58,39,بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَتْكَ ءَايَٰتِى فَكَذَّبْتَ بِهَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرْتَ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The reality is different to what you are now asserting by wishing for guidance. My signs came to you and you denied them, being arrogant. You were of those who rejected, disbelieving in Allah, His signs and His messengers."
"If you see those who had imputed lies to God on the Day of Resurrection, black would be their faces (with disgrace). Is there not a place in Hell for the arrogant?",59,39,وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ تَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وُجُوهُهُم مُّسْوَدَّةٌ أَلَيْسَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,"On the day of resurrection, you will see those who told lies about Allah, by attributing a partner and son to Him, their faces blackened, as a sign of their wretchedness. Is there not a place in Hell for those who are too proud to have faith in Allah and His messengers? Indeed, there is a place for them in it."
God would rescue those who fear Him (and guide them) to places of safety. Neither will evil touch them nor regret.,60,39,وَيُنَجِّى ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ بِمَفَازَتِهِمْ لَا يَمَسُّهُمُ ٱلسُّوٓءُ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Allah will save those who were mindful of their Lord, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, from the punishment by entering them into their place of success, which is Paradise. The punishment will not touch them nor will they grieve over the worldly pleasures they missed."
"God is the creator of all things, and He is the guarantor of all things.",61,39,ٱللَّهُ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,"Allah is the creator of everything. There is no creator besides Him. He has charge over everything, He plans its affair and disposes of it as He wills."
He has the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who deny the revelations of God will be losers.,62,39,لَّهُۥ مَقَالِيدُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,To Him alone belong the keys of the treasures of goodness in the heavens and the earth. He grants it to whoever He wills and withholds it from whoever He wills. Those who reject Allah’s signs they are the losers; as they are deprived of faith in the worldly life and they will enter the fire to live there forever in the Hereafter.
"Say: ""O you ignorant people, do you bid me to worship someone other than God?",63,39,قُلْ أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَأْمُرُوٓنِّىٓ أَعْبُدُ أَيُّهَا ٱلْجَٰهِلُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who entice you to worship their idols: Do you instruct me, O you who are ignorant of your Lord, to worship other than Allah?! None deserves to be worshipped except Allah alone, so I will never worship other than Him."
"Surely you have been commanded, as those before you were: ""If you associate (any one with God), wasted will be all your deeds, arid you will perish.""",64,39,وَلَقَدْ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"Allah had revealed to you, O Messenger, and to the messengers before you: If you worship others together with Allah the reward of your good deeds will be void and you will be of the losers in the world due to the loss of your religion and in the Hereafter due to the punishment."
"So, you should worship only God, arid be among the grateful.",65,39,بَلِ ٱللَّهَ فَٱعْبُدْ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"Rather, worship Allah alone and do not ascribe a partner to Him. Be of those who are grateful to Him for the favours that He has given you."
"They do not esteem God as is rightly due to Him. The whole earth would be a fistful of His on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens would be rolled up in His right hand. Too immaculate is He and too high for what they associate with Him!",66,39,وَمَا قَدَرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِۦ وَٱلْأَرْضُ جَمِيعًا قَبْضَتُهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ مَطْوِيَّٰتٌۢ بِيَمِينِهِۦ سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"The idolaters did not show reverence to Allah as He deserves to be revered when they ascribed others of His weak and feeble creation as partners to Him. They were heedless of Allah’s power, one of the manifestations of which is that the earth together with the mountains, trees, rivers, and oceans in it will be in His grasp on the day of resurrection, and that the seven heavens will be folded up in His right hand. He is transcendent, pure and above what the idolaters say and believe."
"When the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will swoon away, except those God please. When the blast is sounded the second time, they will stand up all expectant.",67,39,وَنُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ,"On the day when the angel appointed to blow the trumpet will blow it, everyone in the heavens and the earth will die. Then the angel will blow it a second time for the resurrection, and they will all stand up alive, looking on to see what Allah will do to them."
"The earth will light up with the effulgence of her Lord; and the ledger (of account) will be placed (in each man's hand), and the apostles and the witnesses will be called, and judgement passed between them equitably, and no wrong will be done to them.",68,39,وَأَشْرَقَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ وَجِا۟ىٓءَ بِٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"The earth will light up when the Lord of Might will appear to decide between the servants. The records of deeds of people will be laid open, the prophets will be brought, and the guardian angels who were witness to the actions of people will be brought. Allah will decide between all of them with justice and they will not be wronged on that day. No person’s evil deeds will be increased, or his good deeds decreased."
Each soul will be paid in full for what it had done. He is cognisant of what you do.,69,39,وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"Allah will give each soul its recompense in full, whether its actions were good or evil. Allah knows best what they do. Nothing of their actions, whether good or bad, is hidden from Him and He will give them the recompense of their actions on this day."
"The unbelievers will be driven into Hell in groups till, when they reach it and its doors are opened up, its keepers will say to them: ""Did not apostles of your own come to you reciting your Lord's revelations, warning you of this your day of Doom?"" They will answer: ""Yes;"" but the sentence of punishment was justified against the unbelievers.",70,39,وَسِيقَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ زُمَرًا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءُوهَا فُتِحَتْ أَبْوَٰبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّكُمْ وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَٰذَا قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"The angels will drive those who rejected Allah to the fire in large crowds. When they will come to Hell, the angels appointed as its keepers will open its doors and receive them with reproach by saying to them: Did not messengers from your kind come to you reciting to you the signs of your Lord that were revealed to them, and warning you of meeting the Day of Resurrection because of the severe punishment therein? The disbelievers will say in confession: Indeed, that took place, but the word of punishment is binding on the disbelievers and we were disbelievers."
"""Enter the gates of Hell,"" they will be told, ""and there abide for ever."" How grievous a destination for the haughty!",71,39,قِيلَ ٱدْخُلُوٓا۟ أَبْوَٰبَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا فَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,"It will be said to them, to further humiliate them and so they may lose all hope in Allah's mercy and ever coming out of the fire: Enter the doors of fire to remain therein forever. How terrible and bad is the place of those who were proud and arrogant against the truth."
"Those who were mindful of their duty to their Lord will be driven in groups to Paradise, till they reach it and its gates are opened, and its keepers say to them: ""Peace be on you; you are the joyous. So enter here to live for ever.""",72,39,وَسِيقَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا۟ رَبَّهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْجَنَّةِ زُمَرًا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَٰبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ طِبْتُمْ فَٱدْخُلُوهَا خَٰلِدِينَ,"The angels will gently lead those who were mindful of their Lord, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, to Paradise in large crowds honoured. When they will come to Paradise its doors will be opened for them and the angels appointed to it will say to them: Peace be on you from every difficulty and from everything you dislike. Your hearts and your actions were pure, so enter Paradise to remain there forever."
"They will say: ""All praise be to God Who has fulfilled the promise He had made to us, and bequeathed to us this land for dwelling in the garden wheresoever we like."" How excellent the recompense for those who act!",73,39,وَقَالُوا۟ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُۥ وَأَوْرَثَنَا ٱلْأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَآءُ فَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَٰمِلِينَ,"The believers will say when they enter Paradise: Praise be to Allah who was true to the promise that He made to us on the tongues of His messengers. He had promised to enter us into Paradise. He has given us the land of Paradise, in which we can live wherever we want to. How excellent is the reward of those who worked by doing righteous actions seeking the pleasure of their Lord!"
"You will see the angels hover round the Throne, singing the praises of their Lord; and justice will be done between them equitably, and it would be said: ""All praise to God the Lord of all the worlds.""",74,39,وَتَرَى ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ حَآفِّينَ مِنْ حَوْلِ ٱلْعَرْشِ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"The angels on that witnessed day will surround the throne, declaring Allah’s transcendence over what is not appropriate for Him as the disbelievers say. Allah will pass judgement between all creation with justice and will honour those whom He honours and punish those whom He punishes. It will be said: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all created things for the judgement that He passed of mercy for His believing servants and punishment for His disbelieving servants."
HA MIM.,0,40,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"The revelation of this Book is from God the all-mighty and all-knowing,",1,40,تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,"The revelation of the Qur’ān sent down to His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him), is from Allah, the Mighty whom none can overpower, the Knower of the interests of His servants."
"Forgiver of trespasses, acceptor of repentance, severe of retribution, lord of power. There is no god but He. Towards Him is your destination.",2,40,غَافِرِ ٱلذَّنۢبِ وَقَابِلِ ٱلتَّوْبِ شَدِيدِ ٱلْعِقَابِ ذِى ٱلطَّوْلِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ إِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Forgiver of the sins of the sinful, Accepter of the repentance of those of His servants who turn to Him, Severe in retribution against those who do not repent from their sins, One of bounty and grace. There is no being deserving of worship besides Him. To Him alone is the return of the servants on the Day of Resurrection and He will give them the recompense they deserve."
Only the unbelievers dispute the revelations of God. So do not let their activities in the land deceive you.,3,40,مَا يُجَٰدِلُ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَلَا يَغْرُرْكَ تَقَلُّبُهُمْ فِى ٱلْبِلَٰدِ,No one disputes about Allah’s signs that indicate to His Oneness and the truthfulness of His messengers except those who reject Allah due to their deficient intellects. Do not grieve over them and do not let the abundant provision and favours that they enjoy deceive you. Their being given respite is a means of gradually luring them into their own destruction.
"The people of Noah had denied before them, and many factions after them. Every nation has intrigued against its apostle and afflicted him, and argued with false arguments to condemn the truth. Then I seized them. How was then My retribution!",4,40,كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَٱلْأَحْزَابُ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ وَهَمَّتْ كُلُّ أُمَّةٍۭ بِرَسُولِهِمْ لِيَأْخُذُوهُ وَجَٰدَلُوا۟ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُوا۟ بِهِ ٱلْحَقَّ فَأَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ,"Before them, the people of Noah denied, as did the confederates after Noah, including 'Ad, Thamud, the people of Lot, the people of Madyan all denied. Pharaoh also denied. Every nation plotted against their Messenger, to capture and kill him. They argued with the falsehood that they had, to remove the truth with it. But I seized all those nations. So reflect over how my retribution against them was! It was a severe retribution."
"In this way the sentence of your Lord against the infidels that they would be the inmates of Hell, was justified.",5,40,وَكَذَٰلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ,"Like how Allah decided to destroy those denying nations, the Word of your Lord, O Messenger, is binding against the disbelievers, that they will be the inmates of the Fire."
"The bearers of the Throne, and those around it, sing the praises of their Lord and believe in Him, and seek forgiveness for those who believe: ""O our Lord, Your mercy and knowledge embrace everything; so forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path; and preserve them from the torment of Hell.",6,40,ٱلَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ ٱلْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُۥ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ رَبَّنَا وَسِعْتَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ رَّحْمَةً وَعِلْمًا فَٱغْفِرْ لِلَّذِينَ تَابُوا۟ وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ سَبِيلَكَ وَقِهِمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"The angels who carry the throne of your Lord, O Messenger, and those who are around it, declare the transcendence of their Lord from that which is not proper for Him, they believe in him, and seek forgiveness for those who have faith in Allah, saying in their supplication: Our Lord, Your knowledge and mercy encompass everything, so forgive those who repent from their sins and follow Your religion and protect them from being touched by the fire."
"Admit them, O Lord, to the garden of Eden which You promised them, and those of their fathers, spouses and progeny who are upright. You are truly all-mighty and all-wise.",7,40,رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّٰتِ عَدْنٍ ٱلَّتِى وَعَدتَّهُمْ وَمَن صَلَحَ مِنْ ءَابَآئِهِمْ وَأَزْوَٰجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّٰتِهِمْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"The angels will say: “Our Lord, enter the believers into gardens of eternity which You promised You will enter them into, and enter those whose actions are good amongst their fathers, wives and children. It is you who are the Mighty with nobody to overpower You, Wise in your decreeing and planning."
"Protect them from evil; and whosoever You preserve from evil on that Day shall have surely received Your mercy. This will be the great triumph.""",8,40,وَقِهِمُ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ وَمَن تَقِ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَقَدْ رَحِمْتَهُۥ وَذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"And save them from their bad actions, so do not punish them as a result. Whomever You protect from punishment for his bad actions, then You have had mercy on him. This mercy by entry into Paradise is the great success which no success can compare with”."
"Those who disbelieve will certainly be told: ""God's displeasure was greater than your disgust of your selves when you were called to belief and refused to believe.""",9,40,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يُنَادَوْنَ لَمَقْتُ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلْإِيمَٰنِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah and His messengers will be addressed on the day of judgment when they enter the fire, whilst they will hate and curse themselves: “Allah's contempt for you when used to be called to believing in Allah, but you would disbelieve in Him, taking dieties besides Him, is greater than your own contempt for yourselves when being thrown into the fire.”"
"They say: ""O Lord, twice You made us die, and twice You made us live. We admit our sins. Is there still a way out for us?""",10,40,قَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَٱعْتَرَفْنَا بِذُنُوبِنَا فَهَلْ إِلَىٰ خُرُوجٍ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,"The disbelievers will say, confessing their sins when their confession will not benefit: “Our Lord, You made us lifeless twice when we were non-existent then You created us, then you gave us death after that creation, and You gave us life twice by creating us from non-existence and by restoring us for the resurrection. We have admitted our sins we earned, so is there any route we can take to exit from the fire, so we can return to life to correct our actions so You become pleased with us?”"
"This has come upon you because when God alone was invoked you disbelieved; but when partners were associated with Him, you believed. But judgement belongs to God, the all-high and supreme.",11,40,ذَٰلِكُم بِأَنَّهُۥٓ إِذَا دُعِىَ ٱللَّهُ وَحْدَهُۥ كَفَرْتُمْ وَإِن يُشْرَكْ بِهِۦ تُؤْمِنُوا۟ فَٱلْحُكْمُ لِلَّهِ ٱلْعَلِىِّ ٱلْكَبِيرِ,"That punishment which you are punished with is because when Allah was called upon and no partner was associated with Him, you disbelieved in Him and made partners for Him. And when partners were worshipped alongside Allah, you believed. So the judgment is with Allah alone, High with His essence, decree and domination, the Great."
"It is He who shows you His signs, and sends you food from the heavens. Yet none takes a warning except him who turns to Him.",12,40,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُرِيكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَيُنَزِّلُ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ رِزْقًا وَمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ إِلَّا مَن يُنِيبُ,"Allah is the one who shows you signs in the horizons and your own selves, to prove to you His power and His oneness, and He sends down for you rainwater from the skies so it becomes a cause for the provision you are given, such as plants, crops and so forth. And nobody takes lessons from the signs of Allah except one who turns to Him, sincerely repenting."
"So call on God with exclusive obedience, howsoever the unbelievers may dislike it.",13,40,فَٱدْعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"So call upon Allah, O believers, being sincere to Him in worship and supplication, without associating partners with Him, even though the disbelievers dislike that and it angers them."
"Most exalted of position, Lord of power, He directs inspiration by His command to any of His creatures as He will, to warn (men) of the Day of Meeting,",14,40,رَفِيعُ ٱلدَّرَجَٰتِ ذُو ٱلْعَرْشِ يُلْقِى ٱلرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِۦ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ ٱلتَّلَاقِ,"So He is worthy of supplication and obedience being made sincere for Him, as He is elevated in ranks, separate from all of His creation. And He is the Lord of the Great Throne. He sends revelation upon whomever He wants from His servants, so that they become alive and make others alive, and so that they warn people of the day of judgment in which the first and last will meet one another."
"The day when they will come out (of their graves), with nothing of them hidden from God. Whose then will be the kingdom? -- God's, the one, the omnipotent.",15,40,يَوْمَ هُم بَٰرِزُونَ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَىْءٌ لِّمَنِ ٱلْمُلْكُ ٱلْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْوَٰحِدِ ٱلْقَهَّارِ,"The day in which they will be apparent having gathered on one plain. Nothing of theirs will be hidden from Allah, nothing of theirs will be hidden from Allah, everything from their own self, their actions, and their reward will be made apparent. He will ask: “For whom is the kingdom today?” There will be only be one answer at this time: the kingdom is for Allah, the One in His essence, qualities and actions, the Prevailing one who has dominated everything and for whom everything has submitted."
Each soul will be recompensed that Day for what it had earned. There will be no depriving on that Day. Surely God is swift at reckoning.,16,40,ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ لَا ظُلْمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Today, every soul will be rewarded for the action it earned: if it was good, then the reward will be good, and if it was bad, then it will be bad. There will be no injustice on this day, because the judge is Allah who is Just. Allah is swift in taking account of His servants, due to His knowledge encompassing them."
"Warn them of the coming day inevitable, when hearts would jump to the throats, filling them with anguish. The sinners will have neither friend nor intercessor whose (word) will be heeded.",17,40,وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْءَازِفَةِ إِذِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ لَدَى ٱلْحَنَاجِرِ كَٰظِمِينَ مَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنْ حَمِيمٍ وَلَا شَفِيعٍ يُطَاعُ,"O Messenger, warn them of the day of judgment. This day of judgment which has drawn near and is coming, and everything which is coming will soon arrive. When the hearts will rise, due to its intense horror, until they reach the throats, They will all be silent, with none of them speaking except whom the Merciful gives permission to. Those who wronged themselves through idolatry and sins will not have any friend, relative or an intercessor who will listen, even if he had the ability to intercede."
"Known to Him is the treachery of the eye, and what the breasts conceal.",18,40,يَعْلَمُ خَآئِنَةَ ٱلْأَعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِى ٱلصُّدُورُ,He knows what the eyes of the lookers secretly glance at and He knows what the hearts conceal. None of that is hidden from Him.
"God decides with justice. But those they call apart from Him can not adjudge in the least. Verily God is all-hearing, all-perceiving.",19,40,وَٱللَّهُ يَقْضِى بِٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ لَا يَقْضُونَ بِشَىْءٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,"Allah judges with justice, so He does not wrong anyone by decreasing His good actions or increasing His bad actions. And those whom the idolaters worship besides Allah cannot judge with anything, because they do not possess anything. Allah is Hearing of the sayings of His servants, Seeing their intentions and actions, and He shall reward them for that."
"Have they not travelled on the earth that they could see what happened to those before them? They were greater in strength than they, and have left behind them traces on the earth. Yet they were seized by God for their sins, and had none to protect them against God.",20,40,أَوَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُوا۟ هُمْ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَءَاثَارًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ,"Have these idolaters not travelled on earth, so that they can ponder how the outcome was of the nations before them who denied, as it was a bad end? Those nations were stronger than they are, and they left an impression on earth by buildings which these people have not left, but Allah destroyed them because of their sins, and they had nobody to protect them from the punishment of Allah."
"This was so because their apostles came with clear proofs to them, but they refused to believe. So they were seized by God. Surely God is powerful, unrelenting in retribution.",21,40,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَكَفَرُوا۟ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّهُۥ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"That punishment which befell them only befell them because their messengers used to come to them with clear proof and evident miracles, but they disbelieved in Allah and denied His messengers. Allah seized them, despite their strength, and destroyed them. He is Powerful, severe in punishing those who disbelieve in Him and deny His messengers."
We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority,22,40,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,I sent Moses with My clear signs and decisive proof.
"To Pharaoh, Haman and Qarun. But they said: ""He is only a deceiving sorcerer.""",23,40,إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَٰمَٰنَ وَقَٰرُونَ فَقَالُوا۟ سَٰحِرٌ كَذَّابٌ,"To Pharaoh, his minister Haman, and Qarun, and so they said: “Moses is a magician and a liar in his claim to be a messenger”."
"And when he brought the truth to them from Us, they said: ""Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women."" But the unbelievers' stratagem is bound to fail.",24,40,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُوا۟ ٱقْتُلُوٓا۟ أَبْنَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ وَٱسْتَحْيُوا۟ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَمَا كَيْدُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ,"Then when Moses came to them with the proof to show his truthfulness, Pharaoh said: “Kill the sons of those who have believed in Moses and keep their women alive, to disgrace them”. And the plot of the disbelievers to attempt to reduce the number of believers will only perish not being successful."
"""Let me kill Moses,"" the Pharaoh said, ""and let him call to his Lord. I fear that he will change your faith and spread corruption in the land.""",25,40,وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ذَرُونِىٓ أَقْتُلْ مُوسَىٰ وَلْيَدْعُ رَبَّهُۥٓ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ أَن يُبَدِّلَ دِينَكُمْ أَوْ أَن يُظْهِرَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلْفَسَادَ,"Pharaoh said: “Leave me to kill Moses, as a punishment for him, and let him call upon his Lord to save him from me. I do not care if he calls upon His Lord. I fear he will change your religion which you follow or corruption will appear on earth by killing and destruction”."
"Moses said: ""I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every insolent imposter who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.""",26,40,وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰٓ إِنِّى عُذْتُ بِرَبِّى وَرَبِّكُم مِّن كُلِّ مُتَكَبِّرٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Moses (peace be upon him) said: “I have sought the protection of my Lord and your Lord against every person who is arrogant to accepting and having faith in the truth, not believing in the resurrection, accounting and punishment."
"A believer from the House of Pharaoh who had kept his faith to himself, said: ""Will you kill a man because he says: 'My Lord is God,' when he has brought clear signs from his Lord to you? If he is a liar his lie will recoil back on him; but in case he speaks the truth, then what he predicts will befall you. Surely God does not show the way to the shameful liar.",27,40,وَقَالَ رَجُلٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَكْتُمُ إِيمَٰنَهُۥٓ أَتَقْتُلُونَ رَجُلًا أَن يَقُولَ رَبِّىَ ٱللَّهُ وَقَدْ جَآءَكُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ وَإِن يَكُ كَٰذِبًا فَعَلَيْهِ كَذِبُهُۥ وَإِن يَكُ صَادِقًا يُصِبْكُم بَعْضُ ٱلَّذِى يَعِدُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى مَنْ هُوَ مُسْرِفٌ كَذَّابٌ,"A believing man from the family of Pharoah, who was hiding his faith from his people said, criticising them for deciding to kill Moses: “Are you going to kill a man without any crime, besides him saying: ‘My Lord is Allah’, despite the fact he brought you miracles and proof to show the truthfulness of his claim to be a messenger from his Lord? If he really is a liar, his lying will turn against him, but if he is truthful, some of the punishment he is promising will quickly befall you. Allah does not guide to the truth one who trespasses His limits and who lies against Allah and His messengers."
"O my people, authority is yours today being the most powerful in the land; but who will save us from the scourge of God if it fall upon us?"" ""I show you,"" said the Pharaoh, ""only what I see (is right), and guide you but to the right path.""",28,40,يَٰقَوْمِ لَكُمُ ٱلْمُلْكُ ٱلْيَوْمَ ظَٰهِرِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَمَن يَنصُرُنَا مِنۢ بَأْسِ ٱللَّهِ إِن جَآءَنَا قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ مَآ أُرِيكُمْ إِلَّا مَآ أَرَىٰ وَمَآ أَهْدِيكُمْ إِلَّا سَبِيلَ ٱلرَّشَادِ,"O people, for you is the kingdom today, dominating in the land of Egypt. So who will save us from Allah’s punishment if it comes to us due to killing Moses?” Pharaoh said: “The opinion is my opinion and the judgment is my judgment. And I have decided to kill Moses, to remove evil and corruption. I only guide you to what is right and correct.”"
"But the man of belief said: ""O my people, what I fear for you is the like of what befell the communities (of old).",29,40,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَامَنَ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُم مِّثْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْأَحْزَابِ,"And the one who brought faith said, advising his people: “I fear for you, if you kill Moses unjustly and oppressively, a punishment like the punishment of the groups that united against their prophets previously, then Allah destroyed them."
"Like the people of Noah, 'Ad and Thamud, and those that came after them. God does not want to be unjust to His creatures.",30,40,مِثْلَ دَأْبِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ظُلْمًا لِّلْعِبَادِ,"Like those who disbelieved and denied the messengers, such as the people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, and those who came after them. Allah destroyed them due to their disbelief and denial of their messengers. And Allah does not intend to oppress the servants. He only punishes them due to their sins."
"O my people, what I fear for you is the day of gathering, crying and calling,",31,40,وَيَٰقَوْمِ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلتَّنَادِ,"O people, I fear for you the day of judgment. That day when people will call one another, calling their relatives or those of status, thinking that they can benefit them in this frightening place."
"The day you will turn your backs and flee, with none to defend you against God. Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.",32,40,يَوْمَ تُوَلُّونَ مُدْبِرِينَ مَا لَكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْ هَادٍ,"The day you will turn away, running out of fear from the fire. You will not have any protector to protect you from Allah’s punishment. Whomever Allah abandons and does not place faith in his heart then there no one who can guide him."
"Joseph had indeed come to you before with clear proofs, but you did not cease to doubt what he had brought until he died, when you said: 'God will not send a prophet after him.' That is how God leads the waster, the sceptic astray.",33,40,وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ يُوسُفُ مِن قَبْلُ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا زِلْتُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّا جَآءَكُم بِهِۦ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا هَلَكَ قُلْتُمْ لَن يَبْعَثَ ٱللَّهُ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ رَسُولًا كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَنْ هُوَ مُسْرِفٌ مُّرْتَابٌ,"Joseph came to you before Moses with clear proof for the oneness of Allah, but you remained in doubt and denial of what he brought, until when he died you increased in doubt and uncertainty, and you said: “Allah will never send a messenger after him”. Just as you are misguided from the truth, Allah leads astray every person who trespasses the limits of Allah and doubts His oneness."
"Those who dispute God's revelations, with no authority having come to them, (are) greatly odious in the sight of God, and the sight of those who believe. That is how God seals every proud and perverse heart.""",34,40,ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ سُلْطَٰنٍ أَتَىٰهُمْ كَبُرَ مَقْتًا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعِندَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كَذَٰلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ قَلْبِ مُتَكَبِّرٍ جَبَّارٍ,"Those who argue about the verses of Allah to refute them without any proof or evidence that has come to them, their argument is greatly hated in the eyes of Allah and in the eyes of those who brought faith in Allah and His messengers. Just as Allah sealed the hearts of these who argue about our verses to refute them, Allah seals the heart of every person who is arrogant to the truth and tyrannical, thus he does not find the path to what is right nor is he guided to good."
"The Pharaoh said: ""O Haman, build me a lofty tower that I may perhaps find the means",35,40,وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ يَٰهَٰمَٰنُ ٱبْنِ لِى صَرْحًا لَّعَلِّىٓ أَبْلُغُ ٱلْأَسْبَٰبَ,"Pharaoh said to his minister Haman: “O Haman, build for me a high building, in the hope I can reach the paths."
"Of reaching the tracts of heaven and look at the god of Moses, though I think that he is a liar."" Thus were the evil deeds of Pharaoh made to look attractive to him, and he was hindered from the path. So the stratagem of Pharaoh was bound to perish.",36,40,أَسْبَٰبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَىٰٓ إِلَٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّى لَأَظُنُّهُۥ كَٰذِبًا وَكَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوٓءُ عَمَلِهِۦ وَصُدَّ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا كَيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلَّا فِى تَبَابٍ,"In the hope I can reach the paths which lead to the skies, so I can see the god of Moses that he claims is the true god. And I believe Moses is lying in what he claims”. And in this way, Pharoah's bad deeds were adorned for him when he made his request to Haman, and he was turned from the true path to the path of misguidance.And the plot of Pharaoh to make the falsehood he believed dominant and to refute the truth Moses brought, is in complete loss. It will be a vain attempt, ending in failure and eternal wretchedness."
"The man who believed said: ""O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the right path.",37,40,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَامَنَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱتَّبِعُونِ أَهْدِكُمْ سَبِيلَ ٱلرَّشَادِ,"The man who believed from the family of Pharaoh said, advising his people and guiding them to the true path: “O people, follow me; I shall show you and guide you to the correct path and guidance to the truth."

The abode of the Hereafter with the everlasting pleasure it contains is the abode of permanence and residence, so work for it by obeying Allah, and be wary of becoming preoccupied from acting for it due to your worldly life."
"Whoever does evil will be requited in accordance with it; but whoever does right, whether man or woman, and is a believer, will enter Paradise, where they will have provision in abundance.",39,40,مَنْ عَمِلَ سَيِّئَةً فَلَا يُجْزَىٰٓ إِلَّا مِثْلَهَا وَمَنْ عَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ يُرْزَقُونَ فِيهَا بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"Whoever does a bad action, he will never be rewarded except with the like of what he did, without punishment being added to it. And whoever does a good action seeking Allah’s pleasure through it, whether the doer is male or female, provided he is a believer in Allah and His messengers - will enter Paradise on the day of judgment. Allah will grant them provision, through what He has placed in it of fruits and the everlasting pleasure which will never end, without account."
"O my people, what is wrong with me that I am calling you to preservation, while you invite me to the Fire!",40,40,وَيَٰقَوْمِ مَا لِىٓ أَدْعُوكُمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّجَوٰةِ وَتَدْعُونَنِىٓ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"O people, why is it that I call you towards salvation from loss in the worldly life and the Hereafter by bringing faith in Allah and good actions, but you call me to enter the fire by asking me to disbelieve in Allah and disobey Him?"
"You are asking me to disbelieve in God, and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, yet I invite you to the all-mighty, all-forgiving.",41,40,تَدْعُونَنِى لِأَكْفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَأُشْرِكَ بِهِۦ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِهِۦ عِلْمٌ وَأَنَا۠ أَدْعُوكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْغَفَّٰرِ,"You are calling me to your falsehood in the hope that I disbelieve in Allah and worship alongside Him others, the truth of which I have no knowledge of, and I am calling you to have faith in Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, the Prevailing who has subdued everything."
"What you are calling me to is surely not worth the calling in this world or in the next, because our returning is to God; and because the transgressors will be inmates of Hell.",42,40,لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّمَا تَدْعُونَنِىٓ إِلَيْهِ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ دَعْوَةٌ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَا فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ مَرَدَّنَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ هُمْ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ,"Truly, what you call me to have faith in and obey is not fit to be called to in this world or the Hereafter nor does it respond to whoever calls upon it. The return of us all is to Allah alone and those who transgress in disbelief and sins are the people of the fire who will enter it forever on the day of judgment."
"You will remember what I say in time to come; I submit my case to the judgement of God. Surely God keeps an eye on His creatures.""",43,40,فَسَتَذْكُرُونَ مَآ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ وَأُفَوِّضُ أَمْرِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَصِيرٌۢ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"But they rejected his advice, and so he said: “You will remember the advice I gave you and you will regret not accepting it. And I entrust all my affairs over to Allah alone. Allah is Seeing of His servants; nothing of their actions is hidden from Him”."
So God preserved him from the evil they were planning; and a dreadful doom encompassed the people of Pharaoh:,44,40,فَوَقَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ سَيِّـَٔاتِ مَا مَكَرُوا۟ وَحَاقَ بِـَٔالِ فِرْعَوْنَ سُوٓءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"So Allah protected him from their evil plot when they intended to kill him, and the punishment of drowning enveloped the followers of Pharaoh, as Allah destroyed him and all his armies in this world."
"Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. The day the Hour is proclaimed (it will be said:) ""Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment,""",45,40,ٱلنَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوًّا وَعَشِيًّا وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوٓا۟ ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"And after their death they will be exposed to the fire at the beginning and end of the day, and on the day of judgment it will be said: “Enter the followers of Pharaoh into the most severe and greatest punishment, due to the disbelief, denial and preventing others from Allah's way.”"
"As they will noisily argue in the Fire, the weaker ones will say to the arrogant: ""We were your followers, so will you take over some of our share of the fire?""",46,40,وَإِذْ يَتَحَآجُّونَ فِى ٱلنَّارِ فَيَقُولُ ٱلضُّعَفَٰٓؤُا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّغْنُونَ عَنَّا نَصِيبًا مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ,"O Messenger, remember when the followers and the leaders from the people of hell will argue, so the oppressed followers will say to the arrogant leaders: “We were your followers in misguidance in the world, so are you going to relieve us of some of Allah’s punishment by bearing it on our behalf?”"
"The arrogant will answer: ""All of us are in it. Surely God has judged between His creatures.""",47,40,قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُلٌّ فِيهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ حَكَمَ بَيْنَ ٱلْعِبَادِ,"The arrogant leaders will say: “We are in the fire, regardless of whether we were followers or leaders. None of us will bear a part of the punishment of the Hereafter. Allah has decided between the servants, so He has given everyone the punishment they deserve”."
"Those in the Fire will say to the warders of Hell: ""Ask your Lord to reduce the punishment by a day for us.""",48,40,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى ٱلنَّارِ لِخَزَنَةِ جَهَنَّمَ ٱدْعُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ يُخَفِّفْ عَنَّا يَوْمًا مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"Those being punished in the fire from the followers and leaders will say to the keepers of hell, once they have lost hope in leaving the fire and returning to the worldly life to repent: “Call upon your Lord to lessen from us one day of this everlasting punishment”."
"They will say: ""Did not your apostles come to you with clear proofs?"" They will answer: ""Indeed, they did."" ""Then pray,"" will (the warders) say. But the praying of unbelievers will be all in vain.",49,40,قَالُوٓا۟ أَوَلَمْ تَكُ تَأْتِيكُمْ رُسُلُكُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ قَالُوا۟ فَٱدْعُوا۟ وَمَا دُعَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ,"The keepers of hell will say in response to the disbelievers: “Did your messengers not come to you with clear proof and evidence?” The disbelievers will say: “Indeed, they used to come to us with clear proof and evidence”. The keepers will say to mock them: “You call, for we are not going to intercede for the disbelievers. But the call of the disbelievers is not but in error and waste, as it will not be accepted from them due to their disbelief”."
"We will certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, in this world, and on the day the witnesses take their stand,",50,40,إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ ٱلْأَشْهَٰدُ,"I will make My messengers and those who believe in what they brought victorious in this world by making their proof manifest and by supporting them against their enemies. And I shall make them victorious on the day of judgement by entering them into Paradise and punishing their disputants in this world by entering them into the fire. This is after the people of truth from the prophets, angels bear witness regarding the message being conveyed and the denial of the disbelieving nations."
"The day upon which their excuses will not benefit the evil-doers, and the condemnation and evil abode will be theirs.",51,40,يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلَهُمُ ٱللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوٓءُ ٱلدَّارِ,"On the day when no excuse will benefit those who wronged themselves by disbelief and sin, and they will be distanced on that day from Allah's mercy, and for them is the evil abode and painful punishment."
"Verily We showed Moses the way, and bequeathed the Book to the children of Israel,",52,40,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَأَوْرَثْنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ,"And I granted Moses miracles and knowledge through which the Israelites would be guided to the truth, and I made the Torah an inherited book amongst the Children of Israel, each generation would pass on it on to the other."
A guidance and reminder for men of wisdom.,53,40,هُدًى وَذِكْرَىٰ لِأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ,As a guidance to the true path and a reminder to the people of sound intellect.
"So persevere; the promise of God is true; and seek forgiveness for your sins, and chant the praises of your Lord evening and morning.",54,40,فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنۢبِكَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْعَشِىِّ وَٱلْإِبْكَٰرِ,"O Messenger, be patient on the denial and harm by your people which you face. Allah’s promise of help and support to you is true without doubt. And seek forgiveness for your sin and glorify the praise of your Lord at the beginning and end of the day."
"Verily those who argue in the matter of God's revelations, without authority having reached them, have nothing but pride in their hearts, and they will not achieve their end. So take refuge in God: Surely He is all-hearing and all-seeing.",55,40,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ سُلْطَٰنٍ أَتَىٰهُمْ إِن فِى صُدُورِهِمْ إِلَّا كِبْرٌ مَّا هُم بِبَٰلِغِيهِ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,"Those who dispute the signs of Allah, striving to refute them without any evidence, do so only because of arrogance to it and a desire for dominance (in this world). They will never achieve their goal of dominance so hold firm, O Messenger, to Allah. It is He who is Hearing of the servants’ statements, Seeing their actions. None of it will escape Him and He will reward them for it."
The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed of greater magnitude than the creation of mankind; but most men do not understand.,56,40,لَخَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"The creation of the heavens and the earth and their greatness and vastness are greater than the creation of mankind, so the one who made them despite their greatness has the power to bring the dead back to life from their graves, to take them to account and reward them. But most people do not know, so they do not consider it nor do they deem it a proof for the resurrection, despite it being so clear."
"The blind and the seeing are surely not alike, nor those who believe and act rightly and those who do evil. Little do you reflect!",57,40,وَمَا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَلَا ٱلْمُسِىٓءُ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"The one who cannot see and the one who can see are not equal, nor are those who have faith in Allah, accept His messengers and do good actions, equal to those who do wrong and have corrupt belief! You do not remember except a little, because if you had remembered you would have known the difference between the two groups so you could strive to be amongst those who have faith and did good deeds, seeking the pleasure of Allah."
The Hour will certainly come; there is no mystery about it; but most men do not believe.,58,40,إِنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لَءَاتِيَةٌ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"The Hour in which Allah will raise the dead for reckoning and reward is definitely coming, without doubt, but most people do not believe it is coming. That is why they do not prepare for it through faith and good actions."
"Your Lord has said: ""Call to Me that I may answer your call. Surely those who disdain worshipping Me will enter Hell, disgraced.""",59,40,وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ٱدْعُونِىٓ أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ,"O people, your Lord said: “Call upon Me alone and worship Me alone, and do not associate any partner with Me. Those who are too arrogant in worshipping Me alone will enter the fire on the Day of Judgment, low and disgraced”."
"It is God who made the night for you to rest, the day to make things visible. Indeed God is gracious to men, but most men are not grateful.",60,40,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيْلَ لِتَسْكُنُوا۟ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَارَ مُبْصِرًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah is the One who has made the night dark for you, so you can find peace in it and rest, and He made the day bright and clear so that you can work in it. Allah is full of great grace to the people when He granted them His apparent and hidden blessings, but most people do not thank Him for what He has blessed them with."
"He is God your Lord, creator of everything. There is no god but He. How then do you turn away (from Him)?",61,40,ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ لَّآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,"That Allah who graciously gave you His favours is the Creator of everything, so there is no creator besides Him. There is no true god besides Him. So how do you turn away from His worship towards worshipping others who do not possess any benefit or harm?"
Only they are turned away thus who deny the signs of God.,62,40,كَذَٰلِكَ يُؤْفَكُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,"Just as these people were turned away from faith in Allah and worshipping Him alone, those who reject Allah’s signs which prove His oneness are turned away in every age and place. So they do not find their way to the truth nor are they divinely guided to it."
"It is God who made the earth a dwelling for you, and the sky a vaulted roof, who fashioned you and gave you excellent form and provided you with clean and wholesome things. He is God, your Lord. So blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.",63,40,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ قَرَارًا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً وَصَوَّرَكُمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُمْ وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O people, Allah is the one who made the earth a suitable place for dwelling/living, and the sky firmly formed above you, prevented from collapsing. And He formed you in the wombs of your mothers, then made perfected your formsyour forms. And He granted you provision from lawful, pleasant foods. He who granted you these blessings is Allah your Lord. So blessed is Allah, Lord of all the creation. There is no Lord besides Him."
"He is the living. There is no god but He. Therefore pray to Him with obedience all-exclusive. Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.",64,40,هُوَ ٱلْحَىُّ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَٱدْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"He is the Living who will not die. There is no true god besides Him. So call upon him in worship and supplication, seeking His pleasure alone, and do not associate any of His creation as partners with Him. All praise is for Allah, Lord of the creation."
"Say: ""I am forbidden to worship those you call apart from God, since clear signs have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.""",65,40,قُلْ إِنِّى نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَمَّا جَآءَنِىَ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ مِن رَّبِّى وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Messenger, say: “Allah has forbidden me from worshipping those whom you worship besides Allah, these idols which do not benefit or harm, when the clear proof and evidence have come to me regarding the falsehood of worshipping them. And Allah has ordered me to submit to Him alone through worship, as He is the Lord of all the creation. There is no Lord besides Him."
"It is He who created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then the embryo; afterwards He brings you forth as a child; then you attain the age of manhood, and then reach old age. But some of you die before you reach the appointed term that you may haply understand.",66,40,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ يُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلًا ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوٓا۟ أَشُدَّكُمْ ثُمَّ لِتَكُونُوا۟ شُيُوخًا وَمِنكُم مَّن يُتَوَفَّىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَلِتَبْلُغُوٓا۟ أَجَلًا مُّسَمًّى وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"He is the one who created Adam from soil, then He created you after him from a sperm-drop, then after a sperm-drop from clotted blood, then after that He takes you out of your mothers’ wombs as small children, then so that you reach the peak of your strength, then so that you grow older until you become elders. And some of you die before that, and so that you reach a fixed time in the knowledge of Allah which you cannot decrease or increase, and so that you benefit from these proof and evidence for His power and oneness."
"It is He who gives you life and death. When He creates a thing, He has only to say: ""Be,"" and it is.",67,40,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ فَإِذَا قَضَىٰٓ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"He alone is the one in whose hand is giving life and He alone is the one in whose hand is giving death. So when He decides a matter, He only says to that matter: “Be” and it becomes."
Have you not seen how those who dispute the signs of God are turned away?,68,40,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ أَنَّىٰ يُصْرَفُونَ,"O Messenger, do you not see those who argue about the signs of Allah, denying them despite them being clear, so you can wonder at their condition whilst they are turning away from the truth despite it being so clear?"
"Those who deny the Book and what We have sent down with Our apostles, will soon come to know",69,40,ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَبِمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا بِهِۦ رُسُلَنَا فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Those who denied the Qur’ān and the truth I sent My messengers with - these deniers will soon learn the outcome of their denial and they shall see the bad ending.
"When, with (iron) collars and chains around their necks, they will be dragged",70,40,إِذِ ٱلْأَغْلَٰلُ فِىٓ أَعْنَٰقِهِمْ وَٱلسَّلَٰسِلُ يُسْحَبُونَ,"They will learn its outcome when the shackles will be on their necks and the chains on their feet, with the angels of hell dragging them."
"Through boiling water, and then burnt in the Fire.",71,40,فِى ٱلْحَمِيمِ ثُمَّ فِى ٱلنَّارِ يُسْجَرُونَ,"They will drag them in hot boiling water, then they will be burnt in the fire."
"They will then be asked: ""Where are they you took as partners",72,40,ثُمَّ قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ,"Then it will be said to them, to scold and rebuke them: “Where are your claimed gods you committed idolatry by worshipping?"
"Apart from God?"" They will answer: ""They have left us in the lurch and fled. In fact it was nothing that we prayed to before."" That is how God sends the unbelievers astray.",73,40,مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَالُوا۟ ضَلُّوا۟ عَنَّا بَل لَّمْ نَكُن نَّدْعُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ شَيْـًٔا كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Besides Allah, from your idols who could not benefit or harm?” The disbelievers will say: “They have disappeared from us, so we cannot see them. In fact, we did not worship anything in the world which deserved to be worshipped”. In the way these people were led astray, Allah leads the disbelievers astray from the truth in every era and place."
"""This is so because you went about exulting wrongfully in the land,"" (will they be told), ""and you were insolent.",74,40,ذَٰلِكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْرَحُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَمْرَحُونَ,It will be said to them: “That punishment which you are suffering is due to your rejoicing over the idolatry you were upon and due to your excess in rejoicing.
"So enter the gates of Hell to abide in it for ever."" How evil the abode of the arrogant!",75,40,ٱدْخُلُوٓا۟ أَبْوَٰبَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا فَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,"Enter the doors of hell, staying therein forever. Wretched is the abode in which those arrogant to the truth will reside”."
"So you persevere with patience (in your mission). The promise of God is true. Whether We show you some of the punishment We have promised them, or gather you up in death, they have to come back to Us.",76,40,فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ,"O Messenger, be patient on the harming and denial of your people. The promise of Allah to help you is true without doubt. So I will either show you in your lifetime some of the punishment I promise them, as occurred in the Battle of Badr, or I will make you die before that. To Me alone they will return on the Day of Judgment, reward them for their actions accordingly, entering them into the fire they will remain in forever."
"Surely We have sent apostles before you, some of whose account We have related to you, and that of some We have not told you. But no apostle was given a miracle unless God dispensed. But when the decree of God comes the sentence is passed with justice; and the lovers of vice and vanity will then come to grief.",77,40,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِّن قَبْلِكَ مِنْهُم مَّن قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِـَٔايَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قُضِىَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,"O Messenger! I have sent many messengers before you to their people, but they rejected them and caused them harm. The messengers were patient upon the rejection and harm they faced. From among these messengers are those whom I have related their stories to you, and those whose stories I have not related. It is not correct for a messenger to bring a sign to his people from his Lord, except if He (may He be glorified) wishes for him to bring it. So, for the disbelievers to demand signs is wrong. When the decree of Allah for victory or judgement in favour of the messengers against their nations happens, the judgement will be made fairly. The disbelievers will then be destroyed and the messengers will be saved. At that point when the judgement is made between the servants, the people of falsehood will lose out by having put themselves in a position of doom by committing disbelief."
It is God who made the cattle for you so that some you ride and some you eat.,78,40,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمَ لِتَرْكَبُوا۟ مِنْهَا وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"Allah is the one who created camels, cows and livestock for you so that you can ride on some of them and consume the meat of some."
"There are advantages for you in them, so that you may satisfy your needs through them, and may be borne upon them and on ships.",79,40,وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَٰفِعُ وَلِتَبْلُغُوا۟ عَلَيْهَا حَاجَةً فِى صُدُورِكُمْ وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ,You have many benefits in these creations as well as ships and other modes of transport which change over time. You can use them to acquire whatever necessities you desire to be fulfilled. And from the most apparent of these needs is transportation across the land and sea.
He shows His signs. How many of God's signs will you then deny?,80,40,وَيُرِيكُمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ فَأَىَّ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ تُنكِرُونَ,"And Allah shows you many of His signs that point to His power and oneness; so which of His signs do you not acknowledge, after it has been established they are His signs?"
"Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them who were far more numerous than they and more strong, and have left behind them traces on the earth. And yet nothing of what they did profited them.",81,40,أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُوٓا۟ أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً وَءَاثَارًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"Do these rejectors not travel the earth and ponder over what the outcome was of the nations who rejected before them, and take heed from it? Those nations were wealthier, stronger and more influential than them in the world, but their actions and strength did not help them at all when the destructive punishment of Allah came."
"For when Our apostles came to them with clear proofs, they boasted and exulted at the knowledge they possessed; but what they used to mock recoiled back on them,",82,40,فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَرِحُوا۟ بِمَا عِندَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"When their messengers brought clear proofs and great miracles to them, they denied them and were happy with the knowledge they had that contradicted whatever their messengers came with. So the very punishment they would mock when warned of by their messengers, came upon them."
"So that when they saw Our might, they said: ""We believe in God the one and single, and reject those we associated (with Him)."" --",83,40,فَلَمَّا رَأَوْا۟ بَأْسَنَا قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَحْدَهُۥ وَكَفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِۦ مُشْرِكِينَ,"Then, when they saw My punishment they began confessing, at a time when no confession would benefit them, saying, “We bring faith upon Allah alone, and reject whatever partners and idols we would worship instead of Him.”"
"But then their affirming served them nothing after they had seen Our torment. This is the law of God that has prevailed among His creatures, Then the unbelievers went to rack and ruin.",84,40,فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَٰنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْا۟ بَأْسَنَا سُنَّتَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِۦ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"So their bringing faith upon seeing the punishment descending upon them, did not benefit them. This is the way of Allah that has been consistent among His servants: that their bringing faith upon seeing the punishment is of no use. The disbelievers doomed themselves at the time when the punishment descended, by having put themselves in a place of destruction because of their disbelief in Allah and not repenting from it before seeing the punishment."
HA MIM.,0,41,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"A revelation from the most benevolent, ever-merciful,",1,41,تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,"This Qur’ān is a revelation from Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful."
"A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand,",2,41,كِتَٰبٌ فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَٰتُهُۥ قُرْءَانًا عَرَبِيًّا لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"It is a book whose verses are perfectly clear; as clear as can be. He has made it an Arabic Qur’ān for a nation that knows, because they are the ones who will benefit from its meanings and contents by achieving guidance towards the truth."
"Announcing happy news and warnings. And yet most of them are averse and do not listen,",3,41,بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا فَأَعْرَضَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ,"It is a giver of glad tidings to the believers of the generous reward Allah has prepared for them, and a warner for the disbelievers of the painful punishment of Allah. But the majority of them turn away from it; they do not listen open-heartedly to its contents."
"And say: ""Our hearts are immured against what you call us to. There is a deafness in our ears, and a veil lies between us and you. So act (your way), we are acting (ours).""",4,41,وَقَالُوا۟ قُلُوبُنَا فِىٓ أَكِنَّةٍ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَآ إِلَيْهِ وَفِىٓ ءَاذَانِنَا وَقْرٌ وَمِنۢ بَيْنِنَا وَبَيْنِكَ حِجَابٌ فَٱعْمَلْ إِنَّنَا عَٰمِلُونَ,"And they say, “our hearts are covered with multiple veils so they do not comprehend what you are calling us to. Our ears are deaf to hearing what you say. There is a veil between you and us; none of your speech reaches us, so you carry on doing as you are on your path, and we will do the same on our path. We will never follow you."
"Say: ""I am a man like you, (but) it is revealed to me that your God is one God, so take the straight path to Him, and ask Him to forgive your sins. Woe to the idolaters",5,41,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَٱسْتَقِيمُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوهُ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to these deniers: “I am only a human just like you are. I receive revelation from Allah that your true deity is only one deity who is Allah, so devote your worship to Him alone and seek forgiveness from Him for your sins. Clear loss is for the idolaters who worship others instead of Allah or ascribe partners with Him."
"Who do not give a due share of their wealth for the welfare of others, and do not believe in the Hereafter.",6,41,ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُم بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,Those who do not pay Zakat on their wealth are on the day of Judgement - with its everlasting blessings and painful torment in it- among the disbelievers.
"But those who believe and do the right, will have a continuing reward.",7,41,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ,"Indeed, those who have faith in Allah and His messengers and do good deeds, for them is an everlasting reward which will never finish: Paradise."
"Say: ""Do you refuse to believe in Him who created the earth in two spans of time, and set up compeers to Him, the Lord of all the worlds?",8,41,قُلْ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْأَرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ وَتَجْعَلُونَ لَهُۥٓ أَندَادًا ذَٰلِكَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters, rebuking them: “Why do you disbelieve in Allah who created the earth in two days: on Sunday and Monday, and you attribute equals to Him whom you worship instead of Him? He is the Lord of all creation.”"
"He placed firm stabilisers rising above its surface, blessed it with plenty and growth, and ingrained the means of growing its food within it, sufficient for all seekers, in four spans.",9,41,وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ مِن فَوْقِهَا وَبَٰرَكَ فِيهَا وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَٰتَهَا فِىٓ أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ,"He created firm mountains on it, which stabilise it and prevent it from shaking. And He proportioned the provisions of the people and animals by the fourth day, following on from the two previous days: Tuesday and Wednesday, equal for whoever wants to ask regarding it."
"Then He turned to the heavens, and it was smoke. So He said to it and the earth: ""Come with willing obedience or perforce."" They said: ""We come willingly.""",10,41,ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَهِىَ دُخَانٌ فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلْأَرْضِ ٱئْتِيَا طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا قَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ,"Then Allah (may He be glorified) resolved to create the sky at a time when it was smoke, saying to it and the earth, “Submit to My command willingly or be forced, it has to be one of the two, They said, “We come willingly; O our Lord! We have no wish except your wish.”"
"Then He created several skies in two spans, and ingrained in each sky its function, decking the nearest heaven with lamps, and guarded it. This has been determined by the mighty and all-knowing.",11,41,فَقَضَىٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَاتٍ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ وَأَوْحَىٰ فِى كُلِّ سَمَآءٍ أَمْرَهَا وَزَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَحِفْظًا ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,"Then Allah completed the creation of the heavens in two days: Thursday and Friday. With that, the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days. Allah inspired in every heaven whatever He would decree concerning it and whatever obedience and worship He would command. Allah also decorated the nearest heaven with stars, and protected it from the satans’ eavesdropping. All that is the decree of the Almighty who no one can overcome, and who is all aware of His creation."
"If even then they turn away, tell them: ""I forewarn you of a terrible punishment like the thunderbolt that fell upon the 'Ad and Thamud.""",12,41,فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا۟ فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَٰعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَٰعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ,"So if these people turn away from bringing faith in what you have brought, then say to them: “I have warned you of a punishment that will fall upon you, like the punishment that fell upon the people of Hud, the ‘Ād, and the people of Saleh, the Thamūd, when they rejected their messengers."
"Their apostles came to them one after the other (saying): ""Do not worship any one but God."" They said: ""If our Lord had pleased He would have sent the angels down. We reject what is sent with you.""",13,41,إِذْ جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلرُّسُلُ مِنۢ بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ قَالُوا۟ لَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّنَا لَأَنزَلَ مَلَٰٓئِكَةً فَإِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"When their messengers came to them, each following the other in bringing one message, instructing them to worship none other than Allah alone. The disbelievers said, “If our Lord wished to send down angels as messengers to us, He would have sent them. Therefore, we reject whatever you have been sent with, because you are humans like we are.”"
"So those who were 'Ad turned insolent unjustly in the land, and said: ""Who is stronger than us?"" Did they not see that God who created them was greater far in power than they? Yet they refused to believe Our signs.",14,41,فَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَقَالُوا۟ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,"As for the people of Hud, the ‘Ād, together with their disbelief in Allah they showed undue arrogance on earth and oppressed those around them. Having been deceived by their own strength, they said, “Who is there that is stronger than us?” There was no one stronger than them, according to their assumption, so Allah replied to them: “Do these people not know and see that the one who created them and gave them the strength that made them rebellious, is stronger than them?” They would reject the signs of Allah that Hud brought to them."
"So We let loose on them a violent wind for several days of distress to make them taste a most disgraceful punishment here in this world, and far more shameful will be the punishment in the Hereafter, and there will be no succour for them.",15,41,فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحًا صَرْصَرًا فِىٓ أَيَّامٍ نَّحِسَاتٍ لِّنُذِيقَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخِزْىِ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَخْزَىٰ وَهُمْ لَا يُنصَرُونَ,"So I sent upon them a wind that had with it a disturbing noise, on days of misfortune for them, due to the punishment which came to them. So that I may make them suffer a punishment of humiliation and disgrace in the world. And indeed, the punishment of the Hereafter that awaits them is more humiliating for them; they will not find anyone to help save them from the punishment."
"As for the (tribe of) Thamud, We tried to guide them, but they preferred blindness to guidance; then they were seized by the torment of a humiliating punishment as requital for their misdeeds;",16,41,وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَٰهُمْ فَٱسْتَحَبُّوا۟ ٱلْعَمَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَٰعِقَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"As for the people of Saleh, the Thamūd, I guided them by making the path of truth clear to them, but they preferred deviance to guidance to the truth, so the humiliating punishment seized them because of the disbelief and sins they would commit."
But We saved those who believed and took heed for themselves.,17,41,وَنَجَّيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ يَتَّقُونَ,And I saved those who had faith in Allah and His messengers and would be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He did not allowed. I saved them from the punishment that came upon their people.
"The day the enemies of God will be gathered at the Fire and the records of their deeds will be distributed,",18,41,وَيَوْمَ يُحْشَرُ أَعْدَآءُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,"And on the day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered towards the hellfire, the Zabāniyah, appointed angels, will thrust each and every one of them into it. They will not be able to escape from it."
So that when they reach it their ears and eyes and persons will testify to what they did.,19,41,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا مَا جَآءُوهَا شَهِدَ عَلَيْهِمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَأَبْصَٰرُهُمْ وَجُلُودُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"When they come to the hellfire they are driven towards and deny the actions they would do in the world, their ears, eyes and skins will testify to their sins and disbelief in the world."
"And they will say to their bodies: ""Why did you testify against us?"" They will answer: ""God, who gave all things power of articulation, made us speak. It is He who created you the first time, and to Him you will return.",20,41,وَقَالُوا۟ لِجُلُودِهِمْ لِمَ شَهِدتُّمْ عَلَيْنَا قَالُوٓا۟ أَنطَقَنَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنطَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ وَهُوَ خَلَقَكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"And the disbelievers will say to their skins, “Why did you testify against us, by stating the things we used to do in the world?” Their skins will say in reply to them, “The one who grants everything the ability to speak, granted us the ability to speak. He is the one who created you initially when you were in the world, and to Him you will return in the Hereafter to give account and be requited.”"
You did not hide your (doings) so that your ears or eyes or persons should not testify against you. In fact you thought that God did not know the things you used to do.,21,41,وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلَآ أَبْصَٰرُكُمْ وَلَا جُلُودُكُمْ وَلَٰكِن ظَنَنتُمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَعْلَمُ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"You did not used to hide when committing sins to a degree that your ears, eyes and skins cannot testify against you, because you did not believe in accountability, punishment or reward after death. Rather, you thought that Allah (may He be glorified) was not aware of many things you did and that it remained hidden from Him, so you were deceived."
"It is this notion you had of your Lord that caused your ruin, and you are lost.""",22,41,وَذَٰلِكُمْ ظَنُّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى ظَنَنتُم بِرَبِّكُمْ أَرْدَىٰكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,"And that very evil thought you thought up concerning your Lord, destroyed you, and so because of it, you became the very ones who lost in the world and the Hereafter."
"Even if they are patient, their abode is Hell; and if they beg for favour, none will favour them.",23,41,فَإِن يَصْبِرُوا۟ فَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُوا۟ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُعْتَبِينَ,"If these people against whom their ears, eyes and skins testified, are to be patient, the hellfire will be their abode and dwelling place they will go to. And if they seek the pleasure of Allah for themselves and entry into Paradise, they will not achieve either of them, ever."
We had assigned to them close companions who made their past and present look attractive to them; and the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them was justified upon them. They were indeed bound to perish.,24,41,وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُوا۟ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ فِىٓ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ خَٰسِرِينَ,"I sent upon these disbelievers, companions from the satans. who would constantly be around them and beautifying disbelief, sins and rejection of the resurrection and requital. the punishment became incumbent upon them as the nations before from the humans and Jinn. Indeed they were the losers, who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Judgement when they enter the fire."
"The disbelievers say: ""Do not listen to this Qur'an, and shout away (its reading); you may haply prevail.""",25,41,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَا تَسْمَعُوا۟ لِهَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَٱلْغَوْا۟ فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ,"When they became helpless in countering evidence with evidence, the disbelievers said, urging one another, “Do not listen to this Qur’ān that Muhammad recites to you and do not submit to it, rather, shout and raise your voices when he recites it to you so that perhaps you can gain the upper hand over him and he stops reciting and calling towards it, then we will be relieved of him.”"
"We shall make the disbelievers taste the severest punishment, and retribute them for the worst that they had done.",26,41,فَلَنُذِيقَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَسْوَأَ ٱلَّذِى كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"So we will definitely make those who disbelieved in Allah and rejected His messengers suffer from a severe punishment on the Day of Judgement. I will definitely requite them with a punishment for the worst of their actions, i.e. ascribing partners with Allah and sins."
"This is the requital for God's enemies: Hell, where they will have their lasting home, as punishment for denying Our revelations.",27,41,ذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ أَعْدَآءِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا دَارُ ٱلْخُلْدِ جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,That aforementioned requital is the requital of those who disbelieved in Him and rejected His messengers; it is the hellfire which they will live forever never to come out of it. It is a requital for their rejection of the verses of Allah and not believing in them despite their clarity and strength in proof.
"Those who disbelieve will say: ""O Lord, show us those among the jinns and men who had led us astray that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject.""",28,41,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ أَرِنَا ٱلَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ نَجْعَلْهُمَا تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِنَا لِيَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْأَسْفَلِينَ,"And those who disbelieved in Allah and rejected His messengers will say, “O our Lord! Show us those humans and Jinn who led us astray: Iblīs who introduced disbelief and inviting towards it and the son of Adam who introduced bloodshed, so that we can put them in the hellfire under our feet; so that they are the lowest of the people and the ones most severely punished.”"
"Surely the angels will come down to those who say, 'Our Lord is God' and then remain steadfast, saying: ""You should have neither fear nor regret, but rejoice in the happy news of Paradise that has been promised you.",29,41,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا۟ وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا۟ وَأَبْشِرُوا۟ بِٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,"Indeed, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah; we do not have any Lord other than Him.” and they are steadfast on fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited, the angels will descend upon them when death nears them, saying to them, “Do not fear death or whatever is to come after it and do not grieve over what you are going to leave behind in the world. Take the glad tidings of Paradise which you were promised in the world for your faith in Allah and your good deeds.”"
"We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter where you will get whatever your hearts desire, and have whatsoever you ask for,",30,41,نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِىٓ أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ,"“We were your friends in the worldly life; we used to correct you and protect you, and we will also be your friends in the Hereafter, so our friendship with you is continuous. In Paradise, you will be able to fulfil whatever your hearts desire and crave, and you will get whatever you seek.”"
"As a gift from the forgiving, ever-merciful (God).""",31,41,نُزُلًا مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ,It is a provision prepared for you by a merciful Lord forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him.
"Whose word is better than his who calls to God and does the right, and says: ""I am of the obedient?""",32,41,وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"There is no one whose speech is better than the one who calls towards the oneness of Allah and acting upon His law, whilst doing good actions that please Him, saying, “Indeed, I am one of those who submit and humble myself to Allah”. Indeed, whoever does all that is the one who is best in speech."
Good and evil are not alike. Repel evil with what is good. Then you will find your erstwhile enemy like a close. affectionate friend.,33,41,وَلَا تَسْتَوِى ٱلْحَسَنَةُ وَلَا ٱلسَّيِّئَةُ ٱدْفَعْ بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا ٱلَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُۥ عَدَٰوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُۥ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ,"Doing good deeds in obedience to Allah that please Him, and doing evil and committing sins which anger Him, are not equal. Counter with good conduct the evil of the one who does bad to you. If you counter his evil by doing good to him, you will soon find the previous enmity you had between you change, and it will be as if he is now an affectionate close friend."
"Only they attain it who forbear, and only a man of great good fortune can achieve it.",34,41,وَمَا يُلَقَّىٰهَآ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَمَا يُلَقَّىٰهَآ إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ,"Only those who are patient upon harm caused to them and difficulties they face from the people, are given the ability to display this praiseworthy character. Only those who are extremely fortunate are granted the ability to do it, because of the abundant goodness and immense benefit there is in it."
"If the Devil incite you to evil, seek refuge in God. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.",35,41,وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ نَزْغٌ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"And if the satan whispers evil to you at any time, hold fast to Allah and seek refuge in Him. He is the Hearing of whatever you say and the Knower of your situation."
"The night and day and the sun and moon are (only) some of His signs. So do not bow before the sun and the moon, but bow in homage to God who created them, if you truly worship Him.",36,41,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِ ٱلَّيْلُ وَٱلنَّهَارُ وَٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ لَا تَسْجُدُوا۟ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,"From the signs of Allah that point towards His greatness and oneness is the night and the day in their coming after one another, and the sun and moon. O people! Do not prostrate to the sun nor the moon; rather, prostrate to Allah alone who created them all, if you truly do worship Him."
But if they become haughty (then remember) that those who are close to your Lord sing His praises night and day and do not grow weary of (doing so).,37,41,فَإِنِ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فَٱلَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُۥ بِٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لَا يَسْـَٔمُونَ,"So if they show arrogance, turning away, not prostating to Allah the Creator, the angels that are with Allah glorify and praise Him (may He be glorified) throughout the day and night anyway, and they do not become bored of worshipping Him."
It is among His signs that the earth you see all barren and desolate begins to stir and sprout when We send down rain upon it. Surely He who gives it life will also give life to the dead. Indeed He has power over everything.,38,41,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓ أَنَّكَ تَرَى ٱلْأَرْضَ خَٰشِعَةً فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَآءَ ٱهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰٓ إِنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"And also from among the signs of Allah that point towards His oneness and power to resurrect, is that you see the earth without any plants on it. Then, when He sends rainwater on it, it begins to move due to the hidden growth of seeds within it and it raises. Indeed, the being who revived this barren earth through growth is the one who will revive the dead and resurrect them to take them to account and requite them. Indeed, He is capable of everything; reviving the earth after it has become barren is not impossible for Him, nor is reviving the dead and resurrecting them from their graves."
"Surely those who slander Our signs are not hidden from Us. Then, is he better who will be cast into Hell, or he who will come out safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you will, He sees whatsoever you do.",39,41,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا لَا يَخْفَوْنَ عَلَيْنَآ أَفَمَن يُلْقَىٰ فِى ٱلنَّارِ خَيْرٌ أَم مَّن يَأْتِىٓ ءَامِنًا يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ مَا شِئْتُمْ إِنَّهُۥ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Indeed, those who deviate from Allah's signs, rejecting or distorting them and turning others away from them are not hidden from us. Allah know who they are. So, is the one who will be thrown into the hellfire more privileged or the one who will come safe from the punishment on the Day of Judgement? O people! Do whatever good or bad you wish; Allah has made good and evil clear to you and He sees whatever you do from it. None of your actions are hidden from Him."
Those who reject the Reminder when it has come to them (should know) that it is a Book inviolate.,40,41,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِٱلذِّكْرِ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَكِتَٰبٌ عَزِيزٌ,"Indeed, those who disbelieved in the Qur’ān when it came to them from Allah will definitely be punished on the Day of Judgement."
Falsehood cannot enter it from any side: It's a revelation from the all-wise and praiseworthy (God).,41,41,لَّا يَأْتِيهِ ٱلْبَٰطِلُ مِنۢ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلَا مِنْ خَلْفِهِۦ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ,"And indeed, it is a noble and protected book. Falsehood in the form of subtraction, addition, change or distortion cannot come to it directly or indirectly. It is a revelation from One who is Wise in His creation, decree and legislation, and praiseworthy in all conditions."
"Nothing is said to you which had not been said to other apostles before you. Surely your Lord is the lord of forgiveness, but also the lord of severe retribution.",42,41,مَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ وَذُو عِقَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"O Messenger! The rejection directed towards you is nothing but the same that has been directed towards the messengers before you, so be patient, because your Lord Forgiving of those of His servants who repent to Him, but one who is painfully punishing of those who insist on their sins and do not repent."
"If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: ""Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly? A foreign tongue and an Arab (audience)?"" Say: ""For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; but for those who do not believe it is a deafness in the ears, and a blindness. They are those one calls to from far away.",43,41,وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَٰهُ قُرْءَانًا أَعْجَمِيًّا لَّقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَٰتُهُۥٓ ءَا۬عْجَمِىٌّ وَعَرَبِىٌّ قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"Had I revealed this Qur’ān in a language other than that of the Arabs, the disbelievers among them would have said, “Why are its verses not made clear to us so that we can understand them?” Can the Qur’ān be in any language other than Arabic, while the one who brings it is an Arab? O Messenger! Say to these people: For those people who bring faith in Allah and believe in His messengers, the Qur’ān is a guidance from deviance and a cure for the ignorance and its consequences in the hearts. As for those who do not have faith in Allah, their ears are deaf and they are blinded from it so they do not understand it. These people are called from a distant place, so how could they hear the voice of the caller?"
Verily We gave Moses the Book; but they began to differ about it. If the Word of your Lord had not preceded it the matter would have been settled between them. They are still in doubt about it and uneasy.,44,41,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَٰبَ فَٱخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,"Verily I gave Moses the Torah and it was disagreed upon. Some believed in it, while others disbelieved in it. Had there not been a promise from Me that there will be judgement passed between the servants on the Day of Judgement in matters they disputed over, judgement would already have been passed upon those who disputed in the Torah. I would have made the ones on the truth clear from those on falsehood and honoured those on the truth whilst disgracing those on falsehood. Indeed, the disbelievers are definitely in suspicious doubts with regards the Qur’ān."
"Whoever does good does so for himself, and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof. Your Lord does no wrong to His creatures.",45,41,مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,"Whoever does good deeds, the benefit of his actions returns to him, because no one’s good deeds benefit Allah. And whoever does bad deeds, the effect of that return to him because no one’s sins harm Allah. Allah will soon requite each person according to what they deserve. O Messenger! Your Lord is not oppressive to His servants; He will never decrease even one good deed of theirs, nor increase an evil one."
"He alone has knowledge of the Hour (of change): No fruit comes Out of its spathe, no female conceives or gives birth, but He has knowledge of it. The day He will call them (and ask): ""Where are the compeers (you ascribed to Me)?"" They will answer: ""We profess to You not one of us can vouch for them.""",46,41,إِلَيْهِ يُرَدُّ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَمَا تَخْرُجُ مِن ثَمَرَٰتٍ مِّنْ أَكْمَامِهَا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنثَىٰ وَلَا تَضَعُ إِلَّا بِعِلْمِهِۦ وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآءِى قَالُوٓا۟ ءَاذَنَّٰكَ مَا مِنَّا مِن شَهِيدٍ,"To Allah alone the knowledge of the hour returns. He alone knows when it will occur. No one besides Him knows this. No fruit emerge from their protective sheath and no female conceives except by His knowledge. Nothing of that escapes Him. On the day when Allah will call the idolaters who used to worship idols together with Him, reproaching them for their worship of those idols: “Where are My partners that you used to worship besides Me and claim they are My partners?” The idolaters will say: We confess before you. There is not one of us who testifies now that you have a partner."
"And those they used to worship will leave them in the lurch, and they will realise there is no escape for them.",47,41,وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَدْعُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَظَنُّوا۟ مَا لَهُم مِّن مَّحِيصٍ,The idols that they used to call on will disappear from them and they will be certain that they will have no escape from Allah’s punishment.
Man never tires of praying for good; but if evil assails him he begins to despair.,48,41,لَّا يَسْـَٔمُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ مِن دُعَآءِ ٱلْخَيْرِ وَإِن مَّسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ فَيَـُٔوسٌ قَنُوطٌ,"Man does not tire of asking for health, wealth, children and other favours. If he is afflicted by poverty, sickness and the like then he becomes extremely despondent of Allah’s mercy."
"If We give him a taste of Our favour after some distress he has known, he says: ""It was my due. I cannot imagine the Hour will come. And even if I go back to my Lord, there will surely still be the best for me with Him."" We shall tell those who do not believe what they used to do, and inflict on them a heavy punishment.",49,41,وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَٰهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَٰذَا لِى وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَآئِمَةً وَلَئِن رُّجِعْتُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّىٓ إِنَّ لِى عِندَهُۥ لَلْحُسْنَىٰ فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِمَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,"If I have to let him taste from Me health, riches and well-being after difficulty and sickness that afflicted him he will certainly say: This is mine, because I am worthy and deserving of it. I do not think the hour will take place. If it is assumed that the hour will take place then I will have the very best by Allah. Just as He favoured me in the world because I was deserving of that, He will favour me in the afterlife. I will certainly tell those who rejected Allah about the disbelief and the sins they did and I will make them taste a punishment of extreme severity."
When We show Our favours to man he moves away and turns aside; but when in trouble he prays a great deal.,50,41,وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى ٱلْإِنسَٰنِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَـَٔا بِجَانِبِهِۦ وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ فَذُو دُعَآءٍ عَرِيضٍ,"When I bless man with the favour of health, well-being and the like, he becomes unmindful of Allah’s remembrance and obedience and turns away in pride. When sickness, poverty and the like afflict him then he becomes one of long supplication to Allah, complaining to Him of what has afflicted him for Him to remove it. He does not thank His Lord when He blesses him and is not patient when He tests him."
"Say: ""Just think. If this is from God and you deny it, who will be in greater error than he who is in open dissent?""",51,41,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ كَفَرْتُم بِهِۦ مَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ هُوَ فِى شِقَاقٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: Tell me, if this Qur’ān was from Allah and then you rejected and disbelieved in it, what will be your condition? Who is more wrong than the person who is stubborn towards the truth despites its appearance and the clarity and strength of its evidence."
"We will show Our signs to them in the horizons of the external world and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it's the truth. Is your Lord not sufficient? He is a witness over all things.",52,41,سَنُرِيهِمْ ءَايَٰتِنَا فِى ٱلْءَافَاقِ وَفِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,I will show them My signs in the heavens and on earth. I will show them My signs within souls so that it will become clear to them without any doubt that this Qur’ān is the truth without any doubt. Is it not enough for these idolaters that the Qur’ān is true by Allah’s testimony that it is from Him? Who can be a greater witness than Allah? If they were seeking the truth they would have sufficed with the testimony of their Lord.
In truth they are in doubt that they will ever face their Lord. Do they not know that He surrounds all things?,53,41,أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ أَلَآ إِنَّهُۥ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّحِيطٌۢ,"Surely, these idolaters doubt the meeting of their Lord on the Day of Judgement as they deny resurrection and they dont believe in the afterlife. Therefore, they do not prepare for it with righteous action. Indeed, Allah’s knowledge and power encompasses everything."
HA MIM.,0,42,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,"This sūrah begins with the disconnected letters, the explanation for which has already preceeded in Sūrah Baqarah."
'Am Sin Qaf.,1,42,عٓسٓقٓ,"This sūrah begins with the disconnected letters, the explanation for which has already preceeded in Sūrah Baqarah."
"So has God, all-mighty and all-wise, been revealing to you and to others before you.",2,42,كَذَٰلِكَ يُوحِىٓ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"The One Who has revealed this Qur’ān to you is Allah. He, (may He be glorified), is the One Who sent revelation to the prophets before you. You are thus not the first to whom Allah sent revelation. He is the Mighty in His decision and the Dominant in His affair."
"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth, belongs to Him. He is all-high and supreme.",3,42,لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Everything in the heavens and on earth belong to Him alone. He created, owns and controls all of it. He is High in His self and in terms of His status and domination, and Majestic in His self."
"The skies are near to bursting asunder above them (for awe of Him), and the angels sing the praises of their Lord, imploring forgiveness for the dwellers of the earth. Is it not that God is forgiving and merciful?",4,42,تَكَادُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِن فَوْقِهِنَّ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَلَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Part of His majesty, (may He be glorified), is that the heavens despite their greatness and height are almost split apart. The angels glorify the praises of their Lord out of submission and in reverence of Him, and they seek forgiveness from Allah for those on earth. Indeed, Allah is the One Who forgives the sins of those servants of His who repent and He is merciful to them."
"Those who have taken protectors other than Him, are watched over by God. It is not for you to be their guardian.",5,42,وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱللَّهُ حَفِيظٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ,"Those who take idols besides Allah whom they align with and worship besides Allah, Allah lies in wait for them. He records their actions and He will recompense them for that. You, O Messenger, are not in charge of them and you will not be questioned about their actions. You are only one who conveys the message."
"We have, therefore, revealed to you the eloquent Qur'an that you may warn the people of the Metropolis, and those who live around it, of the Day of Gathering, of which there is no doubt, (when mankind would be assembled) some in Heaven, some in Hell.",6,42,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ قُرْءَانًا عَرَبِيًّا لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ ٱلْجَمْعِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَرِيقٌ فِى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِى ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"Just as I sent revelation to the prophets before you, O Messenger, I have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’ān so that you may warn Makkah and the Arab towns around it and thereafter the entire mankind, and warn people of the day of resurrection when Allah will gather the earlier ones and the later ones in one plain for reckoning and recompense. There is no doubt in the occurrence of that day, on which people will be divided into two groups: One group will be in Paradise, and these are the believers; and one group will be in the Fire, and these are the disbelievers."
If God had pleased He would have made them one community of belief; but He admits whom He please to His grace; yet the sinners have neither friend nor helper.,7,42,وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَهُمْ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً وَلَٰكِن يُدْخِلُ مَن يَشَآءُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِۦ وَٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ مَا لَهُم مِّن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,"If Allah willed to make them one nation on the religion of Islam He would have done so and entered them all into Paradise. But, His wisdom demanded that He enters whoever He wills into Islam and then enters him into Paradise. Those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins, will have no one to protect them and no helper to rescue them from Allah’s punishment."
"Have they taken others beside Him as protectors? It is God who protects; it is He who gives life to the dead, for He has power over everything.",8,42,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ فَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْوَلِىُّ وَهُوَ يُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Instead, these idolaters have taken allies whom they align with besides Allah. Allah is the true Protector. Others besides Him can bring no benefit nor harm. He gives life to the dead by resurrecting them for reckoning and recompense. He has power over all things and nothing is outside His ability, (may He be glorified)."
"In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgement rests with God. This is God, my Lord; in Him have I placed my trust, if to Him I turn.",9,42,وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّى عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ,"Whatever you, O People, differ in about the principle and secondary matters of your religion, the judgement for that rests with Allah, and His book and the tradition of His Messenger (peace be upon him) must be used as a reference. The One who possesses these attributes is my Lord. It is on Him that I rely in all my affairs and it is to Him that I turn by repenting to Him."
"Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made your consorts from among you, and made pairs of cattle. He multiplies you in this way. There is no other like Him. He is all-hearing and all-seeing.",10,42,فَاطِرُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَمِنَ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ أَزْوَٰجًا يَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِۦ شَىْءٌ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,"Allah is the creator of the heavens and the creator of the earth without any precedent. He made for you from amongst your own kind spouses. He also made for you pairs of camels, cattle and sheep, so that they can multiply for your sake. He creates you through the spouses that He made for you by your marrying one another. He provides livelihood for you through the cattle that He made for you, from their meat and milk. Nothing of His creation resembles Him. He is the One Who hears the statements of His servants, and the One Who sees their actions. Nothing of that escapes Him and He will recompense them for their actions: if good then with good, and if evil then with bad."
He holds the keys of the heavens and the earth. He increases or decreases the provision of any one He will. He has knowledge of everything.,11,42,لَهُۥ مَقَالِيدُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّهُۥ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"To Him alone belong the keys to the treasures of the heavens and the earth. He expands provision for whoever of His servants He wills, as a test to see whether they are grateful or not? He narrows it for whoever of His servants He wills, as a trial to see whether they are patient or become angry with Allah’s decree? He has knowledge of all things. Nothing in which lies the interests of His servants is hidden from Him."
"He has laid down for you the (same) way of life and belief which He had commended to Noah, and which We have enjoined on you, and which We had bequeathed to Abraham, Moses and Jesus, so that they should maintain the order and not be divided among themselves. Heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to. God chooses whom He please for Himself, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him.",12,42,شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا وَصَّىٰ بِهِۦ نُوحًا وَٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا وَصَّيْنَا بِهِۦٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰٓ أَنْ أَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلدِّينَ وَلَا تَتَفَرَّقُوا۟ فِيهِ كَبُرَ عَلَى ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ مَا تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَيْهِ ٱللَّهُ يَجْتَبِىٓ إِلَيْهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِىٓ إِلَيْهِ مَن يُنِيبُ,"He has ordained for you religious matters similar to what I instructed Noah to convey and act on and what I have revealed to you, O Messenger. He has ordained for you similar to what I instructed Abraham, Moses and Jesus to convey and act on. The gist of this is: Uphold the religion and leave out division therein. What you call the idolaters towards, such as the declaring the oneness of Allah and leaving out the worship of others besides Him, is difficult for them. Allah chooses whichever of His servants He wills and guides them to His worship and obedience and He guides to Him those of them who return to Him by repenting from their sins."
"Yet they did not differ about it until knowledge came to them, through rivalries among themselves. If the Word of your Lord, (staying) it for a time ordained, had not preceded it, the matter would have been settled among them. But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.",13,42,وَمَا تَفَرَّقُوٓا۟ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى لَّقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُورِثُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,"The disbelievers and the idolaters only became divided after the proof for the mission of Muhammad (peace be upon him) to them was established. Their division was only on account of rivalry and oppression. Were it not for what had already been in Allah’s knowledge that the punishment will be postponed from them until a time determined in His knowledge, which is the day of resurrection, Allah would have decided between them and punished them quickly on account of their rejection of Allah and denial of His messengers. Those Jews who were made to inherit the Torah, and those Christians who were made to inherit the Gospel, after their predecessors and these idolaters, are in doubt about and deny this Qur’ān which Muhammad (peace be upon him) has brought."
"Yet to that (law) you should call them, and be constant as commanded. Do not follow their passing whims, but say: ""I believe in whatever Scripture God has revealed, and I am commanded to act with equivalence among you. God is our Lord and your Lord. To us our actions, to you your deeds. There is no dispute between you and us. God will gather us all together, and to Him is our returning.""",14,42,فَلِذَٰلِكَ فَٱدْعُ وَٱسْتَقِمْ كَمَآ أُمِرْتَ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَقُلْ ءَامَنتُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن كِتَٰبٍ وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَعْدِلَ بَيْنَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ لَنَآ أَعْمَٰلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَٰلُكُمْ لَا حُجَّةَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Call to this upright religion and remain firm on it as Allah has instructed you. Do not follow their false desires and say them when disputing with them: I have faith in Allah and in the scriptures which Allah sent down to His messengers. Allah has instructed me to judge between you with justice. Allah, the One Whom I worship, is both our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds, whether good or bad and you have your deeds, whether good or bad. There is no quarrel between us after the evidence is apparent and the path is clear. Allah will bring us all together and to Him is the return on the day of resurrection. He will then recompense each one as He deserves and then it will become clear who is true and who is false and who is right and who is wrong."
"As for those who argue in the matter of God after He has been fully acknowledged, their disputing has no force with their Lord. Upon them is (God's) anger, and the punishment for them will be severe.",15,42,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآجُّونَ فِى ٱللَّهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا ٱسْتُجِيبَ لَهُۥ حُجَّتُهُمْ دَاحِضَةٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَلَيْهِمْ غَضَبٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ,"Those who quarrel with invalid arguments about this religion sent down to Muhammad (peace be upon him) after people have responded to his call due to the strength of its proof and have entered into it, the argument of these people who quarrel is void and holds no weight by their Lord and by the believers. It has no effect. On them is Allah’s anger due to their disbelief and rejection of the truth and they will have a severe punishment that awaits them on the day of resurrection."
"It is God who has sent down the Book with the truth, and the Balance. How do you know the Hour is not near?",16,42,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَرِيبٌ,"Allah is the One Who sent down the Qur’ān with the truth, in which there is no doubt. In it He commanded with justice so that people judge by it. The hour that these people deny may be close, and it is known that everything that is coming is close."
"Only they who do not believe in it wish to hasten it; but those who believe are in fear of it, for they know it to be true. Surely those who are in doubt about the Hour are wandering far astray.",17,42,يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا ٱلْحَقُّ أَلَآ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُمَارُونَ فِى ٱلسَّاعَةِ لَفِى ضَلَٰلٍۭ بَعِيدٍ,"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, because they do not believe in reckoning, reward or punishment. But those who have faith in Allah are fearful of it because they do not know their fate after it and they certainly know it to be the truth in which there is no doubt. Indeed, those who dispute about the Hour and doubt its occurrence are in error that is far from the truth."
"God is gracious to His creatures, and bestows favours on whosoever He will. He is all-powerful and all-mighty.",18,42,ٱللَّهُ لَطِيفٌۢ بِعِبَادِهِۦ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْقَوِىُّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ,"Allah is kind towards His servants. He provides for whoever He wills and expands their provision, and He narrows it for whoever He wills out of mercy for them, even though it may appear otherwise. He is the Strong, Whom none can overpower and the Mighty, Who takes retribution from His enemies."
"Whoever desires the fruits of the Hereafter, We shall add to his fruit. As for him who desires the fruits of this world, We shall give to him of these, but he will have no share in the Hereafter.",19,42,مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ نَزِدْ لَهُۥ فِى حَرْثِهِۦ وَمَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِۦ مِنْهَا وَمَا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ مِن نَّصِيبٍ,"Whoever wants the rewards of the afterlife and works for it, I will multiply his reward for him, by multiplying the reward of a good deed by ten times up to seven hundred times or even more. Whoever wants the world alone, I will give him his alotted share in it and he will not have any share in the afterlife as he preferred the world over it."
Have they other associates who have prescribed another law for them which has not been dispensed by God? But for the decisive Word (of God) a sentence would have been passed amongst them. Surely there is a grievous punishment for the ungodly.,20,42,أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَٰٓؤُا۟ شَرَعُوا۟ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَنۢ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةُ ٱلْفَصْلِ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Or do these idolaters have gods besides Allah, who have ordained for them religious matters that Allah did not authorize them to ordain such as ascribing partners to Allah, declaring unlawful what He made lawful and declaring lawful what He made unlawful? Had it not been for the fixed time that Allah had set to decide between those who differ, and that He will postpone them until such time, He would have decided between them. Those who wrong themselves by ascribing partners to Allah and committing sins, will have a painful punishment that awaits them on the day of resurrection."
"You will see the evil-doers full of fear of what they deserve, yet it will come to pass. But those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of Paradise. They will receive what they wish from their Lord; and this will be the greatest favour.",21,42,تَرَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا۟ وَهُوَ وَاقِعٌۢ بِهِمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فِى رَوْضَاتِ ٱلْجَنَّاتِ لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"You, O Messenger, will see those who wrong themselves by ascribing partners to Allah and committing sins fearful of the punishment because of the wrongdoing they did. The punishment will inevitably fall on them. Their mere fear that is devoid of repentance will not be of any use to them. Those who have faith in Allah and in His messengers, and do righteous actions will be in contrast to them. They will be enjoying luxury in gardens of Paradise. They will have whatever type of endless bliss they wish for by their Lord. That is the great bounty which no other bounty can come close to."
"This is the good news that God gives to His creatures who believe and do good. Say: ""I ask no recompense of you for it other than obligations of relationship."" We shall give more excellence to him who acquires excellence. Surely God forgives and accepts (gratitude).",22,42,ذَٰلِكَ ٱلَّذِى يُبَشِّرُ ٱللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ قُل لَّآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا ٱلْمَوَدَّةَ فِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَّزِدْ لَهُۥ فِيهَا حُسْنًا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"That is the good news that Allah gives at the hand of His Messenger to those have faith in Allah and His messengers and do righteous actions. Say, O Messenger: I do not ask of you, for conveying the truth, any reward besides one reward the benefit of which returns to you. That is, you love me because of my blood relationship with you. Whoever does a good deed, I will multiply its reward for him, by multiplying the reward of a good deed by ten times. Allah Forgiving towards the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him, and is grateful for the righteous actions they do seeking His pleasure."
"Do they say he has fabricated a lie about God? He could have sealed your hearts if He pleased; but God blots out the false and vindicates the truth by His dispensations, for He knows the secrets of the hearts.",23,42,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا فَإِن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ وَيَمْحُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَٰطِلَ وَيُحِقُّ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"One of the claims of the idolaters is that they say: Muhammad has invented a lie against his Lord by his claim of being His messenger. One of the things that confirm that the Qur’ān is revelation from Allah is that if He willed He could have made you forget this Qur’ān. But Allah removes falsehood and establishes the truth. This is what occurred to the call of the idolaters, which was removed, and the call of Islam which was established. He knows what is in the hearts of His servants. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"It is He who accepts repentance from His creatures and forgives their trespasses, for He knows what you do.",24,42,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يَقْبَلُ ٱلتَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَعْفُوا۟ عَنِ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ,"He, (may He be glorified), is the One Who accepts the repentance of His servants from disbelief and sins when they repent to Him. He overlooks the wrongdoings that they committed. He knows everything that you do. Nothing of your actions are hidden from Him and He will give you the recompense for them."
"He answers (the prayers) of those who believe and do good, and gives them more of His bounty. But for the unbelievers there is severe punishment.",25,42,وَيَسْتَجِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَيَزِيدُهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِۦ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ,"He responds to the supplication of those who have faith in Allah and His messengers, and gives them more out of His bounty that they did not ask for. Those who reject Allah and His messengers will have a strong punishment awaiting them on the day of resurrection."
If God were to give in abundance to His creatures they would fill the earth with oppression. So He gives according to measure as He will. He knows (what is good for) His creatures. He is all-aware and all-seeing.,26,42,وَلَوْ بَسَطَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِۦ لَبَغَوْا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِن يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَّا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُۥ بِعِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"If Allah had to expand the provision for all of His servants, they would have transgressed on earth by oppression. But He, (may He be glorified), sends down provision to the extent that He wills to expand or narrow it. He is well aware and observant of the states of His servants. He gives for a reason and withholds for a reason also."
"It is He who sends down rain when they had despaired of it, and showers His benevolence. He is the protector worthy of praise.",27,42,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ ٱلْغَيْثَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُوا۟ وَيَنشُرُ رَحْمَتَهُۥ وَهُوَ ٱلْوَلِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"He is the One Who sends down the rain to His servants after they had lost hope of its coming down. He spreads His mercy by causing the earth to sprout after sending down the rain. He is the One Who takes charge of the affairs of His servants, the One Who deserves praise in every state."
"The creation of the heavens and the earth and all the living things dispersed in them, are a sign of His. He has the power to gather them together when He will.",28,42,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَآءُ قَدِيرٌ,"One of the signs of Allah that prove His power and oneness is the creation of the heavens and the creation of the earth, and the wondrous creations that He spread throughout them. He is able to bring them all together for the gathering and recompense whenever He wills. He is not incapable of doing this just as He was not incapable of creating them the first time."
Whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your deeds; yet He forgives much.,29,42,وَمَآ أَصَٰبَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُوا۟ عَن كَثِيرٍ,"Whatever difficulty afflicts you, O people, in yourselves and your wealth it is because of the sins that your hands earned. Allah overlooks many of them and does not take you to task for them."
"You cannot thwart Him on the earth, and have no friend or helper apart from Him.",30,42,وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ,You are not able to save yourselves from your Lord by running away when He wants to punish you. You do not have anyone besides Him to take charge of your affairs nor anyone to help you by removing the punishment if He intends it for you.
Ships sailing in the ocean like ensigns are a sign of His.,31,42,وَمِنْ ءَايَٰتِهِ ٱلْجَوَارِ فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ كَٱلْأَعْلَٰمِ,"From among His signs that prove His power and oneness, are the ships sailing the ocean like mountains in their height and elevation."
"He could stop the wind if He pleased, then they would be stranded on its surface. Surely there are signs in this for every one who perseveres and is grateful.",32,42,إِن يَشَأْ يُسْكِنِ ٱلرِّيحَ فَيَظْلَلْنَ رَوَاكِدَ عَلَىٰ ظَهْرِهِۦٓ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,"If Allah wished to make the wind that moves them still He would have done so, and they will remain fixed on the ocean motionless. In that which has been mentioned about the creation of ships and the subjugation of the winds there are clear signs of Allah’s power for every person who is patient in difficulty and trials, and who is grateful for Allah’s favours to him."
Or He could wreck them for what they have done; yet there is much that He pardons.,33,42,أَوْ يُوبِقْهُنَّ بِمَا كَسَبُوا۟ وَيَعْفُ عَن كَثِيرٍ,"Or if Allah, (may He be glorified), willed to destroy those ships by sending gale-force winds, He would have done so on account of the sins that people earn. He overlooks many of the sins of His servants and does not punish them for those."
Let those who dispute Our signs know that there is no way of escape for them.,34,42,وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا مَا لَهُم مِّن مَّحِيصٍ,"When those ships are destroyed by sending gale-force winds, those who dispute in respect of Allah’s signs, in order to refute them, will know that they have no escape from destruction. Then they will only call on Allah and leave those besides Him."
"Whatsoever you have been given is only this life's merchandise; but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and place their trust in their Lord,",35,42,فَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّن شَىْءٍ فَمَتَٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,"The wealth, fame and children that you have been given, O people, is the enjoyment of this worldly life which will vanish and come to an end. The everlasting bliss is the bliss of Paradise that Allah has prepared for those who have faith in Allah and His messengers and who rely on him alone in all their matters."
"Who avoid the deadly sins, immoral acts, and forgive when they are angered,",36,42,وَٱلَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَٰٓئِرَ ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ وَإِذَا مَا غَضِبُوا۟ هُمْ يَغْفِرُونَ,Those who distance themselves from major and offensive sins and when they are angry at those who offend them by words or deeds they forgive their mistake and do not punish them for it. This pardon is a grace they offer when there is goodness and benefit in it.
"Who obey the commands of their Lord and fulfil their devotional obligations, whose affairs are settled by mutual consultation, who spend of what We have given them,",37,42,وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُوا۟ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأَمْرُهُمْ شُورَىٰ بَيْنَهُمْ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"Those who respond to their Lord, by doing what He instructed and leaving out what He prohibited, and they complete their ritual prayer in the most perfect manner. Those who consult one another in matters of importance to them and who spend from what He have provided for them seeking Allah’s pleasure."
And those who defend themselves when they are wronged.,38,42,وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَابَهُمُ ٱلْبَغْىُ هُمْ يَنتَصِرُونَ,"Those who when afflicted by oppression, they defend themselves, in honour and respect for themselves, if the oppressor is not worthy of pardon. This defence is justified, especially if there is no benefit in pardon."
The retribution of evil is the equal of evil (done); yet those who forgive and rehabilitate will be rewarded by God. Verily He does not like those who do wrong.,39,42,وَجَزَٰٓؤُا۟ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا فَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُهُۥ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Whoever wants to take his right is allowed to do so, but in equal measure without any excess or transgression. Whoever pardons the one who wrongs him and does not take him to task for that wrong, and sets right the relationship with his brother, then his reward is with Allah. He does not love those who do wrong by oppressing people in their selves, wealth, or honour. Rather, He detests them."
"If one avenges himself after he has been wronged, there is no way of blaming him.",40,42,وَلَمَنِ ٱنتَصَرَ بَعْدَ ظُلْمِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مَا عَلَيْهِم مِّن سَبِيلٍ,"For those who defend themselves, there will be no blame as they had taken their right."
"Blame lies on those who oppress, and terrorise the land unjustly. For them there is painful punishment.",41,42,إِنَّمَا ٱلسَّبِيلُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَظْلِمُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَيَبْغُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Blame and retribution will only be for those who oppress people and commit sins on earth. For such people there will be a painful punishment in the Hereafter.
"But he who bears with patience and forgives, surely complies with divine resolve.",42,42,وَلَمَن صَبَرَ وَغَفَرَ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلْأُمُورِ,"As for those who are patient and who overlook the harm caused to them by others, then such patience will bring good for them and for the society. This is a praiseworthy thing and only a person of great fortune is blessed with this."
"He whom God leads astray has no one except God to protect him. You should see the sinners when they face the punishment. They will say: ""Isn't there a way of going back?""",43,42,وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِن وَلِىٍّ مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ وَتَرَى ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ لَمَّا رَأَوُا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ يَقُولُونَ هَلْ إِلَىٰ مَرَدٍّ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,"Those whom Allah does not bless with guidance and lets them stray from the truth, they will have no one to take charge of their affairs after Him. You will see those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins, when they will see the punishment on the day of resurrection, longingly saying: If only we are able to return to the world and repent to Allah."
"You should see them brought before the Fire, abject in disgrace, looking stealthily. And those who believe will say: ""They who forfeit their souls and families on the Day of Resurrection will really be losers."" Is it not that sinners will suffer a lasting torment?",44,42,وَتَرَىٰهُمْ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا خَٰشِعِينَ مِنَ ٱلذُّلِّ يَنظُرُونَ مِن طَرْفٍ خَفِىٍّ وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَلَآ إِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ فِى عَذَابٍ مُّقِيمٍ,"You will see, O Messenger, these wrongdoers when they are exposed to the fire, whilst they are humiliated and disgraced, looking at people surreptitiously due to their extreme fear for it. Those who had faith in Allah and His messengers will say: The true losers are those who lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection on account of the punishment of Allah that they received. Indeed, those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins will be in a lasting punishment that will never end."
They will have no protector to help them other than God. He whom God allows to go astray has no way.,45,42,وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ يَنصُرُونَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِن سَبِيلٍ,"They will have no allies to help them by rescuing them from Allah’s punishment on the day of resurrection. Those whom Allah does not bless with the truth and lets them go astray, will never have any path that leads them to guidance to the truth."
Hearken to your Lord before the Day arrives from God that will not be averted. You will have no place of refuge then nor time for denying.,46,42,ٱسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِرَبِّكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لَّا مَرَدَّ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَكُم مِّن مَّلْجَإٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن نَّكِيرٍ,"Respond, O people, to your Lord by rushing to fulfil His instructions and avoid His prohibitions and leaving out procrastination, before the Day of Resurrection comes, which cannot be pushed back when it arrives. You will have no place to take refuge in and you will not be able to deny the sins that you have perpetrated in the world."
"If they turn away (you are not responsible); We have not appointed you a warden over them. Your duty is to deliver the message. When We let man taste of Our favours he begins to exult; but if misfortune befalls him, as a consequence of his own deeds, man is surely then ungrateful.",47,42,فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا۟ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا إِنْ عَلَيْكَ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَإِنَّآ إِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً فَرِحَ بِهَا وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌۢ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَإِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ كَفُورٌ,"If they turn away from what you instruct them, then I have not sent you, O Messenger, as a guardian over them to watch their actions. Your duty is only to convey what I have instructed you to convey and their reckoning is left to Allah. When I give man a taste of My mercy of riches, health etc. he rejoices in it. But when a trial of difficulty befalls them on account of their sins, their nature is to be ungrateful for Allah’s favours and become angry at what Allah had in His wisdom decreed."
"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatsoever He wills, bestows daughters on whosoever He will, and gives sons to whom He choose.",48,42,لِّلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ يَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ إِنَٰثًا وَيَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ٱلذُّكُورَ,"Or He makes for whoever He wills both males and females and makes whoever He wills barren and childless. He knows what occurs and what will occur in the future. This is on account of the completeness of His knowledge and perfection of His wisdom. Nothing is hidden from Him. He is able to do all things, nothing is outside His ability."
"On some He bestows both sons and daughters, and some He leaves issueless. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.",49,42,أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ ذُكْرَانًا وَإِنَٰثًا وَيَجْعَلُ مَن يَشَآءُ عَقِيمًا إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ,"Or He makes for whoever He wills both males and females and makes whoever He wills barren and childless. He knows what occurs and what will occur in the future. This is on account of the completeness of His knowledge and perfection of His wisdom. Nothing is hidden from Him. He is able to do all things, nothing is outside His ability."
"It is not given to man that God should speak to him except by suggestion or indirectly, or send a messenger to convey by His command whatsoever He please. He is all-high and all-wise.",50,42,وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَّا وَحْيًا أَوْ مِن وَرَآئِ حِجَابٍ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ رَسُولًا فَيُوحِىَ بِإِذْنِهِۦ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ,"It is not correct for a human being that Allah speaks to Him except through revelation that He sends to him, or by direct speech but from behind a veil without seeing Him, or by sending an angel as a messenger such as Gabriel, who then reveals to the human messenger with Allah’s permission what Allah wishes to reveal. He, (may He be glorified), is high in His Self and Attributes, and is wise in His creation, decree and laws."
"So have We revealed to you the Qur'an by Our command. You did not know what the Scripture was before, nor (the laws of) faith. And We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please; and you certainly guide them to the right path,",51,42,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا ٱلْكِتَٰبُ وَلَا ٱلْإِيمَٰنُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلْنَٰهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِى بِهِۦ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِىٓ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Just as I sent revelation to the prophets before you, O Messenger, I revealed to you a Qur’ān from Me. Prior to it you did not know about the heavenly scriptures revealed to the messengers, and you did not know what is faith? But I revealed this Qur’ān as a light by which I guide whomever of My servants I wish. You show people a straight path, which is the religion of Islam."
The path of God to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And will not all things go back to God?,52,42,صِرَٰطِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَلَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ تَصِيرُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"The path of Allah to Whom belongs whatever is in the heaven and whatever is in the earth. He created, owns and controls all of it. Definitely all matters return to Allah alone in their estimation and planning."
HA MIM.,0,43,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"I call to witness the lucent Book,",1,43,وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Allah takes an oath on the Qur’ān which clearly explains the path of guidance towards the truth.
That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand.,2,43,إِنَّا جَعَلْنَٰهُ قُرْءَٰنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"I have revealed it as a Qur’ān in the language of the Arabs, in the hope that you, O people in whose language it was revealed - will comprehend and understand its meanings to transmit it to other nations."
"It is inscribed in the original Book (of Books) with Us, sublime, dispenser of (all) laws.",3,43,وَإِنَّهُۥ فِىٓ أُمِّ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ,"This Qur’ān is in the Preserved Tablet with us in the highest gathering and is high in status, honour and position. It is wise in that the instructions contained in it are not devoid of wisdom, and it is perfect without any contradiction or disagreement."
Should We have withdrawn the Reminder from you as you are a people who exceed the bounds?,4,43,أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ ٱلذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْمًا مُّسْرِفِينَ,"I will not leave out the revelation of the Qur’ān to you and calling you to monotheism because you are engrossed in ascribing partners to Allah and violating His prohibitions. I will not do so, as mercy for you demands otherwise."
"Many a prophet had We sent to the earlier communities,",5,43,وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِىٍّ فِى ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,How many a messenger did I send in previous nations.
But never did a prophet come at whom they did not scoff.,6,43,وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن نَّبِىٍّ إِلَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,Whenever a prophet came to those previous nations from Allah they used to mock at him.
So We destroyed far more powerful (nations) than they. The example of earlier people is there.,7,43,فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشًا وَمَضَىٰ مَثَلُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"I destroyed those who were mightier than those nations, so we not incapable of destroying those who are weaker than them. The description of the destruction of the previous nations has passed in the Qur’ān, such as the Ad, Thamud, nation of Lot and the people of Madyan."
"If you ask them: ""Who created the heavens and the earth?"" they will answer: ""The Mighty and All-knowing created them,""",8,43,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"O Messenger! If you ask these idolaters who deny, “Who created the heavens and who created the earth?” they will say in response to your question, The Mighty whom none can overpower, the Knower of everything, created them."
"He who made the earth a bed for you, and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way;",9,43,ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ مَهْدًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Allah is the One who made the earth for you stable and firm. He made for you in it paths in its mountains and valleys, in the hope that you will be guided by them in your travel."
"Who sent down water in due measure from the sky, then quickened a region that was dead -- So shall We bring you forth --",10,43,وَٱلَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۢ بِقَدَرٍ فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِۦ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتًا كَذَٰلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ,"The one who sends down water from the heavens in proportion to what suffices you, your animals and crops, then revives with it a barren land in which there is no growth. Just as Allah revives that barren land with growth, He will revive you for the resurrection."
"He who created pairs of everything, and fashioned for you boats and beasts on which you ride,",11,43,وَٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْأَزْوَٰجَ كُلَّهَا وَجَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْفُلْكِ وَٱلْأَنْعَٰمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ,And He has made ships and livestock for you which you ride on your travels; boarding the ships over the sea and mounting the livestock over land.
"So that when you sit astride of them and think of the bounties of your Lord, you may say: ""All glory to Him who subjugated these for us. We were incapable of doing so.",12,43,لِتَسْتَوُۥا۟ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِۦ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُوا۟ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا ٱسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُوا۟ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱلَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُۥ مُقْرِنِينَ,"He had created for you all that, in the hope that you settle yourselves on the backs of your mounts during your travels and then remember the blessing of your Lord over you in your hearts, in that He has made them subservient to you when you mount them, saying with your tongues: “The being who made these mounts subservient for us is pure and glorified. We control them, whilst we would not have been able to do so if it had not been for His making them subservient to us.”"
"Surely we have to go back to our Lord.""",13,43,وَإِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ,"“And indeed, we are definitely going to return to our Lord alone for accountability and requital.”"
Yet they make some of His creatures His offspring! Man is surely most ungrateful.,14,43,وَجَعَلُوا۟ لَهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦ جُزْءًا إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ,"The idolaters claim that some of the creations are the offspring of the Creator (may He be glorified), when they said, “The angels are the daughters of Allah”. Indeed, the human who makes these kind of statements is very ungrateful and deviant."
"Or has He taken from those He has created daughters for Himself, and assigned sons to you?",15,43,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَىٰكُم بِٱلْبَنِينَ,"O idolaters! Do you say: “Allah has chosen daughters for Himself from among the things He creates”, whilst He has privileged you with male offspring? What an absurd distribution this is which you claim!"
"Yet when news of (a daughter) they had reserved for Ar-Rahman comes to one of them, his face is blackened (with shame), and he grieves in silence inwardly.",16,43,وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ مَثَلًا ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُۥ مُسْوَدًّا وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"When one of them is given news of the birth of a female whom he attributes to his Lord, his face becomes gloomy out of severe grief and sadness, and he himself becomes full of anger. How then can he attribute to his Lord the very thing that he himself is saddened by when informed of it?"
Can one who has been raised on ornaments and cannot present her case coolly in a dispute (be associated with God?),17,43,أَوَمَن يُنَشَّؤُا۟ فِى ٱلْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى ٱلْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ,Do they attribute to their Lord the one who is brought up in adornment and is unclear in speech when arguing due to its femininity?
"Yet they have made the angels, who are creatures of Ar-Rahman, females. Did they witness their creation? We shall record their testimony, and they will be interrogated.",18,43,وَجَعَلُوا۟ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَٰدُ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ إِنَٰثًا أَشَهِدُوا۟ خَلْقَهُمْ سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَٰدَتُهُمْ وَيُسْـَٔلُونَ,"They also regard as feminine the angels that are in reality the servants of The Merciful. Were they present at the time of Allah created them, so that they would know that they are actually females? The angels will record this statement of theirs and they will be questioned regarding it on the Day of Judgement. And they will be punished for it because of their lies."
"Yet they say: ""If Ar-Rahman had so pleased we would not have worshipped them."" They have no knowledge of it in the least. They only make up lies.",19,43,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ مَا عَبَدْنَٰهُم مَّا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ,"And they say, using divine decree as evidence, “If Allah willed that we did not worship the angels, we would not have worshipped them. So because He willed for it to happen, it proves He was happy with it.” They make this statement out of ignorance; they are only lying."
Did We give them a Scripture before this to which they are holding fast?,20,43,أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمْ كِتَٰبًا مِّن قَبْلِهِۦ فَهُم بِهِۦ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ,"Or, have I given these idolaters a book before the Qur’ān that allows them to worship other than Allah, which they are holding fast to and using as evidence?"
"In fact they say: ""We found our fathers following a certain way, and are guided by their footprints.""",21,43,بَلْ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ,"No! That has not happened. Rather, they are using their blind following as evidence, saying, “Indeed, we found our forefathers before us upon a belief and they used to worship idols. We are continuing in their footsteps in worshipping them.”"
"Thus, We never sent an admonisher to a settlement before you but the decadent among them said. ""We found our fathers following this way, and we are walking in their footsteps.""",22,43,وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلَّا قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ,"And just as these people have lied and used the blind following of their forefathers as evidence, O Messenger, I did not send any messenger to any community before you, except that those living in luxury in that village said, “Indeed, we found our forefathers upon a belief, and we are following in their footsteps”, so your nation is not any different in that regard."
"""Even if I bring you a better guidance,"" he rejoined, ""than the one you found your fathers on?"" Still they said: ""We do not believe in what you have brought.""",23,43,قَٰلَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُم بِأَهْدَىٰ مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"Their messengers said to them, “Will you follow your forefathers even if I brought to you something that was better than the belief they were on?” They said, “Indeed, we reject whatever you and the messengers before you have been sent with.”"
Then We punished them. So look at the fate of those who denied.,24,43,فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"So I took retribution from the nations that rejected the messengers before you and I destroyed them. So ponder over what the outcome of the rejectors was, because their outcome was painful."
"When Abraham said to his father and his people: ""I am rid of what you worship",25,43,وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِۦٓ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ,"O Messenger! Remember when Abraham said to his father and his people: “Indeed, I am innocent of the idols you worship instead of Allah.”"
"Other than Him who created me. He will show me the right way.""",26,43,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُۥ سَيَهْدِينِ,"“Except for Allah who created me, because He will soon guide me to follow the true religion of His and that will benefit me.”"
This is the legacy he left to his descendants so that they may turn (to God).,27,43,وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةًۢ بَاقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِۦ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"And Abraham made this monotheistic statement of his remain in his progeny after him. There remained among them those who would worship Allah alone and not attribute any partners with Him, in the hope that they turn to Allah having repented from ascribing partners with Him and sins."
"In fact, I allowed them and their fathers to enjoy this life till the truth, and the apostle preaching it lucidly, came to them.",28,43,بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَءَابَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ,"I did not hasten the destruction upon these rejecting idolaters. Rather, I let them enjoy remaining in the world and I let their forefathers do the same, until the Qur’ān and a clear Messenger: Muhammad (peace be upon him) came to them."
"Yet when the truth had come to them, they said: ""This is sorcery. We shall never believe in it.""",29,43,وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"And when this Qur’ān came to them, which was the undoubted truth, they said, “This is sorcery which Muhammad intends to bewitch us with. We definitely reject it and will never believe in it.”"
"They also said: ""Why was this Qur'an not sent down to some great man of the two cities?""",30,43,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ,"The rejecting idolaters say, “Why did Allah not reveal this Qur’ān upon one of the two great men of Makkah or Taif: Al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah or ‘Urwah ibn Mas‘ūd Al-Thaqafī, instead of revealing it upon the poor, orphaned Muhammad?”"
"Are they the ones who dispense the favour of your Lord? It is He who apportions the means of livelihood among them in this world, and raises some in position over the others to make some others submissive. The favours of your Lord are better than what they amass.",31,43,أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَتَ رَبِّكَ نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَٰتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا سُخْرِيًّا وَرَحْمَتُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,"O Messenger! Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord, that they can give it to and prevent from it whomsoever they wish? It is I who distributed their provisions between them in the world making some of them rich and some poor, so that they are subservient to each other. The mercy of your Lord to His servants in the afterlife is better than the temporary, mortal things of the world that these people hoard."
"Had it not been that all people would become one community (of unbelievers), We might have given those who disbelieve in Ar-Rahman roofs of silver for their dwellings and (silver) stairs for mounting,",32,43,وَلَوْلَآ أَن يَكُونَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفًا مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ,"Had it not been that humanity was on one creed of disbelief, I would have made in the houses of those who disbelieved in Allah roofs of silver and stairs upon which they could climb."
"And doors (of silver) for their houses, (silver) couches for reclining,",33,43,وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ أَبْوَٰبًا وَسُرُرًا عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِـُٔونَ,"And I would make doors for their houses and give them elevated seats to recline on, as a trial and to gradually lead them into destruction."
And ornaments of gold. But all this would have been nothing but the vanity of this world. The Hereafter with your Lord is for those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path.,34,43,وَزُخْرُفًا وَإِن كُلُّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْءَاخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"I would also give them gold. All that is only the temporary enjoyment of the world; its benefit is little because of its ultimate extinction. However O Messenger, the bounties of the afterlife are better according to your Lord, for those who are mindful of Him by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited."
"We shall attach to him who goes blind to the remembrance of Ar-Rahman a devil as companion, --",35,43,وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُۥ شَيْطَٰنًا فَهُوَ لَهُۥ قَرِينٌ,"And whoever turns away from this Qur’ān that was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), I shall set a satan upon him who will lure him with falsehood and lead him astray; it will remain with him wherever he goes."
"Surely the (devils) obstruct them from the path, though they think they are rightly guided, --",36,43,وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,"Indeed, these satan companions who have been set upon those who turn away from the Qur’ān, prevent them from the religion of Allah. They are unable to fulfil His commands and refrain from things He has not allowed; they think that they are guided to the truth and so they do not repent from their deviance."
"Until when he comes before Us he will say (to the devil): ""Would to God there was a distance of the East and West between you and me, for you were an evil companion!""",37,43,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَنَا قَالَ يَٰلَيْتَ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ ٱلْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرِينُ,"Until when the one who turns away from the remembrance of Allah will come to Him on the Day of Judgement, he will longingly say, “O companion! If only there had been the distance of the east and west between you and I! You were such a disgraceful companion!”"
"But nothing will avail you on that day, for you were unjust, and you will be partners in the punishment.",38,43,وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى ٱلْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ,"Allah will say to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement, “After you have oppressed yourselves by ascribing partners to Me and committing sins, your sharing the punishment will not benefit you in the slightest today, despite you accompanying each other in disbelief and committing sins in the world.”"
"Can you make the deaf to hear, or show the blind, and those lost in clear error, the way?",39,43,أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى ٱلْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"Indeed, these people are deaf from hearing the truth and blind from seeing. O Messenger! Are you then capable of making the deaf hear, guiding the blind, or guiding the one clearly astray from the straight path?"
"We shall punish them whether We take you away,",40,43,فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ,"If I was to take you away by causing you to die before I punish them, I would be taking retribution from them by punishing them in the world and the Hereafter."
Or show you some of what We have promised them. They are certainly well within Our power.,41,43,أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ ٱلَّذِى وَعَدْنَٰهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِم مُّقْتَدِرُونَ,"Or if I was to show you some of the punishment I have prepared for them; indeed, I possess the capability over them and they cannot overpower me in the slightest."
So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. You are truly on the right path.,42,43,فَٱسْتَمْسِكْ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,So O Messenger! Hold fast to whatever your Lord has revealed to you and practice it; you are upon the path of truth in which there is no uncertainty.
It is a (source) of greatness for you and your people. You will surely be questioned about it.,43,43,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَٔلُونَ,"And indeed, this Qur’ān is an honour for you and your nation. You shall soon be questioned on the Day of Judgement regarding bringing faith in it, following its guidance and calling towards it."
Inquire of apostles We had sent before you if We appointed gods to be worshipped other than Ar-Rahman.,44,43,وَسْـَٔلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ,O Messenger! Ask those messengers I sent before you: “Did Allah make deities that were to be worshipped instead of the Merciful?”
"We sent Moses with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles. He said: ""I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds.""",45,43,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَإِي۟هِۦ فَقَالَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Verily, I sent Moses with My signs to Pharaoh and the leaders from his people. He said to them, “Indeed, I am the Messenger of the Lord of all creation.”"
"But when he brought to them Our signs they laughed at them,",46,43,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنْهَا يَضْحَكُونَ,"Then when he brought My signs to them, they began to laugh at them, mockingly."
(Even though) each miracle that We showed them was greater than the other. So We seized them with chastisement so that they may turn back.,47,43,وَمَا نُرِيهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلَّا هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا وَأَخَذْنَٰهُم بِٱلْعَذَابِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"I showed Pharaoh and his leaders proof after proof to establish the authenticity of Moses’ message, each proof was greater in magnitude than the previous one. I seized them with the punishment in the world, in the hope that they turn away from the disbelief they were in, but to no avail."
"But they said: ""O sorcerer, call on your Lord for us in accordance with the compact He has made with you. We shall certainly come to guidance.""",48,43,وَقَالُوا۟ يَٰٓأَيُّهَ ٱلسَّاحِرُ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ إِنَّنَا لَمُهْتَدُونَ,"So when some of the punishment came upon them, they said to Moses (peace be upon him), “O sorcerer! Pray to your Lord for us asking Him to remove this punishment just as He said He would if we believed. If it is removed from us, we will be guided to the truth.”"
Yet no sooner did We take away the affliction from them than they broke their pledge.,49,43,فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ,"Then, when I removed the punishment from them, they began breaking their covenant and not fulfilling it."
"And the Pharaoh said to his people: ""O people, is not mine the kingdom of Egypt and these rivers that flow at my feet? Can you still not comprehend?",50,43,وَنَادَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فِى قَوْمِهِۦ قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَٰذِهِ ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِىٓ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ,"Pharaoh called out among his people, bragging about his kingdom, “O my people! Do I not own the country of Egypt, and these rivers that flow beneath my palaces? Do you not see my kingdom and recognise my greatness?”"
"Am I (not) better than him who is contemptible, and cannot even express himself clearly?",51,43,أَمْ أَنَا۠ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ وَلَا يَكَادُ يُبِينُ,"“Therefore, I am better than the weak, runaway Moses who cannot even speak well.”"
"Why were then no bracelets of gold shed upon him from above, or angels sent down as a retinue with him?""",52,43,فَلَوْلَآ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ,"“Why did Allah who sent him not throw down golden bracelets on him so that it becomes clear that he is His Messenger, or why did the angels not come with him, following one another?”"
"Thus he made light (of the matter) to his people, and they obeyed him. They were certainly wicked.",53,43,فَٱسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُۥ فَأَطَاعُوهُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا فَٰسِقِينَ,"So Pharaoh duped his people and they followed him in deviance. Indeed, they were a nation that came away from the obedience of Allah."
"But when they roused Our anger We inflicted retributive punishment and drowned them all,",54,43,فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا ٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَٰهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"Then, when they angered Me by continuing upon disbelief, I took retribution from them and drowned them all."
And made them a precedent and example for posterity.,55,43,فَجَعَلْنَٰهُمْ سَلَفًا وَمَثَلًا لِّلْءَاخِرِينَ,"So I made Pharaoh and his people an example for those who did actions like theirs, that they would perish just like they did. I also made them a lesson for those who take heed; so that they do not do the same actions as theirs and are then afflicted with whatever came upon them."
"When the example of Mary's son is quoted before them, your people cry out at it,",56,43,وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلًا إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ,"When the idolaters thought that the Jesus the Christians worshipped was included in the statement of Allah the Exalted: {Indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than Allah are the firewood of Hell. You will be coming to [enter] it}, and Allah had prohibited worshipping him just like He had prohibited the worship of idols, your people, O Messenger, began persisting in argument, saying, “We are pleased that our idols are of the same status as Jesus.” So Allah revealed, refuting them, {Indeed, those for whom the best [reward] has preceded from Me - they are from it far removed}."
"And say: ""Are our deities better or he?"" They say this only for disputing. Surely they are a contentious people.",57,43,وَقَالُوٓا۟ ءَأَٰلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلَّا جَدَلًۢا بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ,"And they say, “Are our deities better or is Jesus better?” Ibn Al-Ziba‘rā and others did not draw up this comparison in love of hope in reaching the truth, rather in love of argumentation. They are a nation quarrelsome in nature."
(Jesus) was only a creature whom We favoured and made an example for the children of Israel.,58,43,إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُ مَثَلًا لِّبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ,"Jesus, the son of Mary is nothing but a servant from the servants of Allah whom He favoured with messengership and made him an example for the Israelites. They can use him as proof of the power of Allah because He created him without a father, just like He created Adam without parents."
If We pleased We could have put angels in place of you as trustees on the earth.,59,43,وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُم مَّلَٰٓئِكَةً فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ,"O children of Adam! If I wish to destroy you and make the angels succeed you on earth in your place, they would worship Me and not ascribe partners with me at all."
"He is certainly the sign of the Hour (of change). So have no doubt about it, and listen to me. This is the straight path.",60,43,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلَا تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَٱتَّبِعُونِ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"Indeed, Jesus is a sign from the major signs of the Hour, when he shall descend towards the end of time. So do not doubt the Hour’s occurrence and follow me in whatever I have brought to you from Allah. This thing I have brought is the straight path in which there is no deviance."
Let not Satan misdirect you. He is your open enemy.,61,43,وَلَا يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"And let Satan not turn you away from the straight path through his lure and deception. Indeed, he is an enemy whose enmity is clear."
"When Jesus came with the signs, he said: ""I have come to you with authority, and to explain some thing about which you are at variance. So fear God, and follow me.",62,43,وَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَلِأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,"After Jesus (peace be upon him) brought clear signs of his messengership to his people, he said to them, “I have brought wisdom to you from Allah so that I can make clear to you some matters of your religion you differ in. So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited, and obey me in whatever I command you with and prohibit you from.”"
"Verily God is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is the straight path.""",63,43,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"“Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord; we have no Lord other than Him, so devote your worship to Him alone. This monotheism that I call you towards and devotion of worship to Allah is the straight path in which there is no deviance.”"
But the factions differed among themselves. Woe alas to the sinners for the torment of the grievous Day!,64,43,فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلْأَحْزَابُ مِنۢ بَيْنِهِمْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ,"Then, groups of the Christians disagreed in regards to Jesus. Some of them say, “He is a god”, and some say, “He is the son of God”, and others say, “He and his mother are both gods”, so woe be to those who oppress themselves by attributing godhood to Jesus, or sonship, or saying that he is one of the Trinity! Woe be to them from a painful punishment that awaits them on the Day of Judgement."
"Are they waiting (for any thing) but the Hour (of Doom) which would descend upon them suddenly, and catch them unawares?",65,43,هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا ٱلسَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"These disputing parties in regards to Jesus await nothing except the Hour which will come to them suddenly, whilst they do not even perceive its arrival. If it comes to them whilst they are upon disbelief, then their abode is a painful torment."
"Friends will turn into enemies on that day, except those who fear and follow the straight path.",66,43,ٱلْأَخِلَّآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍۭ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلَّا ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"Those who befriend each other upon disbelief and deviance will be enemies to one another on the Day of Judgement, except for those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited. Their friendship is everlasting and will not break."
"O My creatures, there will be no fear or regret",67,43,يَٰعِبَادِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَلَآ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ,"Allah will say to them: “O My servants! There is no fear upon you today in what you will face, nor will you grieve over what you lost out on from the good of the world.”"
For (those of) you on that day who believed in My revelations and submitted.,68,43,ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَكَانُوا۟ مُسْلِمِينَ,"“Those who believed in the Qur’ān that was revealed upon their Messenger and were submissive to it, fulfilling its commands and refraining from things He did not allow.”"
"(You will) enter the garden, you and your spouses, and be glad.""",69,43,ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَٰجُكُمْ تُحْبَرُونَ,"“Enter Paradise; you and your equals in faith. You will be pleased with the everlasting blessings you will encounter, which shall not finish nor expire.”"
"Golden platters and goblets will be passed around, and everything the heart desires and pleases the eye will be there, where you will abide for ever.",70,43,يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِم بِصِحَافٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَابٍ وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ ٱلْأَنفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ ٱلْأَعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,Their servants will roam among them with golden plates and handleless cups. In Paradise there is whatever the hearts desire and the eyes are delighted with seeing. You will reside in it eternally.
This is the Paradise you will inherit (as meed) for your deeds.,71,43,وَتِلْكَ ٱلْجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِىٓ أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"That Paradise I have described for you is the one I have made you inherit because of your deeds, through My grace."
You will have fruits in abundance there to eat.,72,43,لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَٰكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,"There are many fruits in it for you which shall never finish, from which you can eat."
The sinners will certainly dwell for ever in the torment of Hell.,73,43,إِنَّ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدُونَ,"Indeed, the criminals who commit disbelief and sins will be in the punishment of hell on the Day of Judgement, wherein they shall remain forever."
It will not decrease for them; dumb with despair they will stay in it.,74,43,لَا يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ,The punishment will not be lessened for them. They will lose all hope in the mercy of Allah in it.
"We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.",75,43,وَمَا ظَلَمْنَٰهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا۟ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"I will not oppress them by entering them into the hellfire, rather they oppressed themselves by disbelieving."
"They will call (to the keeper of Hell-gate): ""O Malik, let your Lord decide our fate."" He will answer: ""You are to stay.""",76,43,وَنَادَوْا۟ يَٰمَٰلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ قَالَ إِنَّكُم مَّٰكِثُونَ,"They will call out to Mālik, the gatekeeper of the hellfire, saying: “O Mālik! Our Lord should make us die so that we are relieved of this punishment!” Mālik will answer them saying, “You are to remain forever in the punishment. You will not die, nor will the punishment stop from you.”"
"We have brought to you the truth, but most of you despise the truth.",77,43,لَقَدْ جِئْنَٰكُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَٰرِهُونَ,"Indeed, I brought the undisputed truth to you in the world, but the majority of you disliked the truth."
Have they settled upon a plan? We shall also settle on one.,78,43,أَمْ أَبْرَمُوٓا۟ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ,"So, if they plot against the Prophet (peace be upon him) and hatch an evil plan against him, I will indeed, hatch a plan against them which will be greater than theirs."
"Or do they think We do not hear their secrecies and stealthy consultations? In fact, Our messengers who attend them record everything.",79,43,أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لَا نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَىٰهُم بَلَىٰ وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ,"Or, do they think that I do not hear their secrets that they hide within their hearts, or those that they whisper to one another? Nay! I hear them all, and the angels with them write everything they do."
"Say: ""If Ar-Rahman had a son I would have been the first of worshippers.""",80,43,قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلْعَٰبِدِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to those who attribute daughters to Allah, who is exalted greatly from their statement: “If, hypothetically, Allah had a child, then I would be the first to worship that child.”"
"All too glorious is He, Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of all power, for what they ascribe to Him",81,43,سُبْحَٰنَ رَبِّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"The Lord of the heavens, the earth and the Throne is pure of the statements of attributing partners, wives and children of these idolaters."
Leave them to their vain discoursing and horse-play till they come to meet their promised day (of reckoning).,82,43,فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُوا۟ وَيَلْعَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يُلَٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ,"So O Messenger! Leave them to continue in whatever falsehood they are engrossed in, and let them enjoy until they meet the day which they have been promised. They will soon know the outcome of their actions and regret it."
"He is God in heaven and God on earth, and He is all-wise and all-knowing.",83,43,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَٰهٌ وَفِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَٰهٌ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"He (may He be glorified) is the true deity in the heavens and the true deity on earth. And He is the Wise in His creation, decree and management, and Knower of the conditions of His servants. None of them are hidden from Him."
"Blessed be He, who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. He alone has knowledge of the Hour, and to Him will you return.",84,43,وَتَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِى لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَعِندَهُۥ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,Allah’s goodness and blessings continue to increase - (may He be glorified). To Him alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them. And with Him alone is the knowledge of the Hour in which the Day of Judgement will occur; no one else knows it. And to Him alone will you all return in the afterlife for accountability and requital.
"Those they invoke apart from Him have no power of intercession, except those who testify to the truth and have knowledge.",85,43,وَلَا يَمْلِكُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةَ إِلَّا مَن شَهِدَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Those deities that the idolaters worship instead of Allah are not able to intercede in front of Allah, except those that testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah whilst understanding their testimony, i.e. Jesus, Ezra and the angels."
"If you ask them who created them, they will answer: ""God."" How then can they turn away?",86,43,وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"And if you ask them, “Who created you?” they would definitely say, “Allah created us”, so how can they then turn away from His worship after this acknowledgement?"
"And (the Prophet) will say: ""O Lord, these are certainly a people who do not believe.""",87,43,وَقِيلِهِۦ يَٰرَبِّ إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ قَوْمٌ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"With Allah (may He be glorified) is the knowledge of the complaint of His Messenger when they rejected him, and his statement regarding them: “O my Lord! Indeed, these people are a nation that does not believe in what you sent me to take to them.”"
"Turn away from them and say: ""Peace."" They will come to know soon.",88,43,فَٱصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ وَقُلْ سَلَٰمٌ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"So ignore them, and say to them whatever repels their evil - this was in Makkah - they will soon realise what punishment they will face."
HA MIM.,0,44,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
The perspicuous Book is witness,1,44,وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Allah takes an oath on the Qur’ān which clearly explains the path of guidance towards the truth.
(That) We sent it down one night of blessing -- so that We could warn --,2,44,إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ فِى لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَٰرَكَةٍ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ,"Indeed, I revealed the Qur’ān on the Night of Decree; it is a night of much goodness. Indeed, I warn through this Qur’ān."
On which all affairs are sorted out and decided,3,44,فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ,"On this night every precise matter related to provisions, lifespans etc. are decided which Allah is to make happen that year."
"As commands from Us. It is indeed We who send (messengers),",4,44,أَمْرًا مِّنْ عِندِنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ,"I decide every precise matter of Mine; indeed, I am the one who sends the messengers."
"A mercy from your Lord. Verily He is all-hearing and all-knowing,",5,44,رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"O Messenger! I send the messengers through My mercy for those whom they are sent towards. Indeed, may I be glorified I am the Hearer of the statements of My servants, the Knower of their intentions; none of them are hidden from Me."
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, if you really do believe.",6,44,رَبِّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِينَ,"He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth and whatever lies between them. If you are convinced of that, then bring faith upon my Messenger."
"There is no god other than He, who gives you life and death, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.",7,44,لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,There is no true deity except him. He gives life and causes death; there is no one that does that except Him. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers before you.
Yet they are lost in doubt and play.,8,44,بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ يَلْعَبُونَ,"These idolaters are not convinced of that, rather, they are in doubt about it and distract themselves from it with the falsehood they are in."
"So watch for the day when the sky begins to emit clear smoke,",9,44,فَٱرْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى ٱلسَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,So O Messenger! Wait for their punishment that will come soon: a day when the sky is clearly filled with smoke.
Which would envelope mankind. That would be a grievous affliction.,10,44,يَغْشَى ٱلنَّاسَ هَٰذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"It will cover the people, and will be said to them, “This punishment that has afflicted you is a painful punishment.”"
"""O Lord, take away this torment from us,"" (they will pray); ""we have come to believe.""",11,44,رَّبَّنَا ٱكْشِفْ عَنَّا ٱلْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مُؤْمِنُونَ,"They will then beg their Lord, asking him, “O our Lord! Turn the punishment that you sent upon us, away from us. If you turn it away from us, we will believe in You and in Your Messenger.”"
"How can a warning benefit them? The Apostle who explained all things clearly had come to them,",12,44,أَنَّىٰ لَهُمُ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ,"How can they take heed and repent to their Lord now, when a clear Messenger came to them before, and they knew of his truthfulness and honesty?"
"But they turned away from him, and said: ""He is well-instructed, (but) possessed.""",13,44,ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْا۟ عَنْهُ وَقَالُوا۟ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ,"They turned away from believing in him, and said about him, “He was taught. Other people taught him; he is not a messenger.” They also said, “He is a madman.”"
"If We remove the torment a little, you revert back (to misdeeds).",14,44,إِنَّا كَاشِفُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابِ قَلِيلًا إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ,"Indeed, when I turn the punishment away from them for a short while, they will return to their disbelief and rejection."
"The day that We shall seize them with a grievous hold, We will indeed castigate them.",15,44,يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ ٱلْبَطْشَةَ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰٓ إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ,"O Messenger! Wait for the day when I will seize the disbelievers with the greatest seizing, by entering them into the hellfire on the Day of Judgement wherein they will live forever. I will take retribution from them for their disbelief in Allah and rejecting His messengers."
We had tried the people of Pharaoh before them. A respected prophet had come to them (saying):,16,44,وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَجَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ كَرِيمٌ,"And verily I tested the people of Pharaoh before them, and their noble messenger came to them from Allah calling them towards His oneness and worship. He was Moses (peace be upon him)."
"""Deliver the creatures of God to me. I am the trusted messenger sent to you.",17,44,أَنْ أَدُّوٓا۟ إِلَىَّ عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ إِنِّى لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ,"Moses said to Pharaoh and his people, “Leave the Israelites to me, because they are the servants of Allah; you have no right to take them as slaves. Indeed, I am a messenger to you from Allah, I am trustworthy in conveying what He has commanded me to convey. I will not take anything away from it nor add anything to it.”"
Do not think yourselves to be above God: I have come to you with clear authority.,18,44,وَأَن لَّا تَعْلُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنِّىٓ ءَاتِيكُم بِسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"“And do not show arrogance to Allah by leaving His worship and assuming superiority over His servants. Indeed, I will bring to you a clear proof.”"
I have taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord against your stoning me to death.,19,44,وَإِنِّى عُذْتُ بِرَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ أَن تَرْجُمُونِ,“And I have sought protection in my Lord and your Lord from you killing me by stoning.”
"If you do not believe in me, leave me alone.""",20,44,وَإِن لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا۟ لِى فَٱعْتَزِلُونِ,"“If you do not believe in whatever I have brought, then leave me alone; do not approach me intending harm.”"
"Then he called to his Lord: ""These are a sinful people.""",21,44,فَدَعَا رَبَّهُۥٓ أَنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ قَوْمٌ مُّجْرِمُونَ,"Then Moses supplicated to his Lord: “This nation i.e. Pharaoh and his people, are a criminal nation who deserve a swift punishment.”"
"""Journey by night with My devotees,"" (it was said); ""you will certainly be pursued.",22,44,فَأَسْرِ بِعِبَادِى لَيْلًا إِنَّكُم مُّتَّبَعُونَ,"So Allah commanded Moses to take his people away at night, and informed him that Pharaoh and his people will pursue them."
"(Cross and) leave the sea undisturbed. The (pursuing) hosts will surely be drowned,""",23,44,وَٱتْرُكِ ٱلْبَحْرَ رَهْوًا إِنَّهُمْ جُندٌ مُّغْرَقُونَ,"He also commanded him that when they all cross the sea, to leave it standing as it was, because Pharaoh and his people were to be destroyed by drowning in it."
"How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind,",24,44,كَمْ تَرَكُوا۟ مِن جَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,How many gardens and flowing springs did Pharaoh and his people leave behind!
"And fields and stately mansions,",25,44,وَزُرُوعٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ,And how many farms and beautiful places did they leave behind!
And the comfort they enjoyed.,26,44,وَنَعْمَةٍ كَانُوا۟ فِيهَا فَٰكِهِينَ,"And how many lives of luxuries they used to live, did they leave behind!"
Thus it was; and We passed them on to another people.,27,44,كَذَٰلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَٰهَا قَوْمًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"Whatever has been described to you happened to them, and we made another nation i.e. the Israelites inherit their gardens, springs, farms and structures."
"Neither did the heavens weep for them, nor the earth, nor were they granted respite.",28,44,فَمَا بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُنظَرِينَ,"Neither the heavens nor the earth cried over Pharaoh and his people when they drowned, nor were they given respite to repent."
So We saved the children of Israel from degrading suffering,29,44,وَلَقَدْ نَجَّيْنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْمُهِينِ,"And verily I saved the Israelites from the humiliating punishment, because Pharaoh and his people would kill their children and keep their women alive."
"They (had experienced) under the Pharaoh. He was certainly a tyrant, guilty of excess.",30,44,مِن فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ عَالِيًا مِّنَ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"I saved them from the punishment of Pharaoh. Indeed, he was an arrogant one from those who transgressed the command and religion of Allah."
"And We exalted them over the other people knowingly,",31,44,وَلَقَدِ ٱخْتَرْنَٰهُمْ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"And verily I selected the Israelites knowingly over the people of their time, because of their many Prophets."
And sent them tokens to bring out the best in them.,32,44,وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُم مِّنَ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ مَا فِيهِ بَلَٰٓؤٌا۟ مُّبِينٌ,"And I granted them miracles through which I gave strength to Moses, and in which there was an obvious blessing for them, like the Mann and Salwā and other than them."
Even then they say:,33,44,إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ لَيَقُولُونَ,"Indeed, these rejecting idolaters will say, denying the resurrection:"
"""There is no dying for us but once; and we shall not be raised again.",34,44,إِنْ هِىَ إِلَّا مَوْتَتُنَا ٱلْأُولَىٰ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُنشَرِينَ,"“It is only our first death that we will die; there is no life after that, and we are not going to be resurrected after this death.”"
"So bring our ancestors back, if you are truthful.""",35,44,فَأْتُوا۟ بِـَٔابَآئِنَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"“O Muhammad! If you are truthful in your claim that Allah will resurrect the dead alive for requital and accountability, then bring back to life our forefathers who have died.”"
"Are they better than the people of Tubba, and those who had lived before them, whom We destroyed as they were sinners?",36,44,أَهُمْ خَيْرٌ أَمْ قَوْمُ تُبَّعٍ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ أَهْلَكْنَٰهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ مُجْرِمِينَ,"O Messenger! Are these denying idolaters stronger and more resistant, or the people of Tubba‘ and those after them like the ‘Ād and Thamūd? I destroyed them all. Indeed, they were criminals."
"We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, out of play.",37,44,وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا لَٰعِبِينَ,"And I did not create the heavens, the earth and everything between it in jest and amusement."
We created them with definite purpose; but most of them do not understand.,38,44,مَا خَلَقْنَٰهُمَآ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"I only created it due to a profound wisdom, but the majority of idolaters do not know that."
"The Day of Judgement is your promised day of meeting,",39,44,إِنَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَصْلِ مِيقَٰتُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,The day of judgment in which Allah will decide between the servants is the appointed time for all of the creation in which Allah will gather them.
"The day when friend will help no friend in the least, nor will they be helped,",40,44,يَوْمَ لَا يُغْنِى مَوْلًى عَن مَّوْلًى شَيْـًٔا وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"The day when no relative will benefit his relative or friend benefit his friend nor will they be saved from Allah’s punishment, because authority on that day will be for Allah. Nobody will be able to claim it."
Apart from those to whom God is kind. He is all-mighty and all-merciful.,41,44,إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Except the person Allah has mercy on, for he will benefit from the good action he has sent forward. Allah is the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in His creation, decree and plan."
The tree of Zaqqum will indeed be,42,44,إِنَّ شَجَرَتَ ٱلزَّقُّومِ,The tree of zaqqum which Allah has grown at the bottom of the fire
The food of sinners.,43,44,طَعَامُ ٱلْأَثِيمِ,Is the food of the extremely sinful who will eat of its horrible fruit!
It is like pitch. It will fume in the belly,44,44,كَٱلْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى ٱلْبُطُونِ,"Like black oil, boiling in their stomachs due to its intense heat."
As does boiling water.,45,44,كَغَلْىِ ٱلْحَمِيمِ,Like the boiling of extremely hot water.
"""Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell,"" (it will be said),",46,44,خُذُوهُ فَٱعْتِلُوهُ إِلَىٰ سَوَآءِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"It will be said to the keepers of hell: “Grab him, drag him violently and harshly towards the middle of the fire”."
"""Then pour over his head the torment of scalding water.""",47,44,ثُمَّ صُبُّوا۟ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِۦ مِنْ عَذَابِ ٱلْحَمِيمِ,"Then pour hot water over the head of this person being punished, so that the punishment does not separate from him."
"""Taste it,"" (they will be told). ""You were indeed the mighty and noble!",48,44,ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ,"It will be said to him, mockingly: “Taste this painful punishment. You are the mighty who is not treated unjustly, noble amongst your people."
"This is certainly what you had denied.""",49,44,إِنَّ هَٰذَا مَا كُنتُم بِهِۦ تَمْتَرُونَ,"This is the punishment you used to doubt will occur on the Day of Judgment, but now your doubt has been removed from you by seeing it”."
Surely those who fear and follow the straight path will be in a place of peace and security,50,44,إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِى مَقَامٍ أَمِينٍ,"Those who are mindful of their Lord through carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions will be in a place of residence, safe from every misfortune that could afflict them."
"In the midst of gardens and of springs,",51,44,فِى جَنَّٰتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,In gardens and flowing springs.
"Dressed in brocade and shot silk, facing one another.",52,44,يَلْبَسُونَ مِن سُندُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ مُّتَقَٰبِلِينَ,They will wear in Paradise fine and thick silk. They will be facing one another and not see each other’s nape.
Just like that. We shall pair them with companions with large black eyes.,53,44,كَذَٰلِكَ وَزَوَّجْنَٰهُم بِحُورٍ عِينٍ,"Just as I will honour with that which is mentioned, I will marry them in Paradise to beautiful women with beautiful wide eyes."
They will call for every kind of fruit with satisfaction.,54,44,يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِكُلِّ فَٰكِهَةٍ ءَامِنِينَ,"They will call their attendants therein to bring them every fruit they wish, safe from their being cut off and from their harms."
"There they will not know any death apart from the first death they had died, and will be kept safe from the torment of Hell",55,44,لَا يَذُوقُونَ فِيهَا ٱلْمَوْتَ إِلَّا ٱلْمَوْتَةَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ وَوَقَىٰهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Living therein forever. They will not taste death therein except the first death in the worldly life, and their Lord will save them from the punishment of the fire."
By the beneficence of your Lord. This will be the great success.,56,44,فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكَ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"As a grace and kindness from your Lord to them, O Messenger. That which is mentioned, namely entering them into Paradise and saving them from the fire is the great success which no success can compare with."
Therefore We have made this (Qur'an) easy in your tongue. They may haply take a warning.,57,44,فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَٰهُ بِلِسَانِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"I have made this Qur’ān easy and facilitated it for you by revealing it in your language of Arabic, O Messenger, so that they take heed."
So you wait. They are also waiting.,58,44,فَٱرْتَقِبْ إِنَّهُم مُّرْتَقِبُونَ,So await your help and their destruction; they are awaiting your destruction.
HA MIM.,0,45,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"The revelation of this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.",1,45,تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"The revelation of the Qur’ān is from Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in His creating, decreeing and planning."
Indeed there are signs for believers in the heavens and the earth.,2,45,إِنَّ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"In the heavens and earth are proof of the power of Allah and His oneness for the believers, because they are the ones who take heed from signs."
"In creating you and spreading all the moving things (on earth) are signs for people firm of faith,",3,45,وَفِى خَلْقِكُمْ وَمَا يَبُثُّ مِن دَآبَّةٍ ءَايَٰتٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,"And in your creation, O people, from a sperm-drop, then from a lump, and then from a clot, and in the creation of the creatures Allah has spread out on the face of this earth are proof of His oneness, for people who have conviction that it is Allah who is the Creator."
"As there are signs in the alternation of night and day, and in rain that God sends with which He revives the earth once dead, as there are in the changing of the winds, for people who can understand.",4,45,وَٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن رِّزْقٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَٰحِ ءَايَٰتٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"And in the alteration of the night and day, and the rainwater Allah sent down from the sky, then He gave life to the earth through it by making plants grow in it after it was dead without any plants, and in the alteration of the winds by bringing them from one direction at times and other directions at other times for your benefit, are proof for people who understand. So they use them as proof of Allah’s oneness, His power to resurrect and His power over everything."
These are revelations of God which we recite to you correctly: In what other lore but God and His manifestations would they then believe?,5,45,تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍۭ بَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ وَءَايَٰتِهِۦ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"These verses and proof I read to you in truth, O Messenger. So if they do not believe in the speech of Allah which He revealed to His servant and in His proof, which speech will they believe in after it and which proof after it will they accept?"
Alas the woe for every dissembling sinner,6,45,وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ,Allah’s punishment and destruction is for every liar who is extremely sinful.
"Who hears the revelations of God being recited to him, yet persists in denying with arrogance as though he had never heard them! So warn him of a painful punishment.",7,45,يَسْمَعُ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ ثُمَّ يُصِرُّ مُسْتَكْبِرًا كَأَن لَّمْ يَسْمَعْهَا فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"This disbeliever listens to the verses of Allah in the Qur’ān being recited to him, then he continues in the disbelief and sins he is in, arrogant in himself to following the truth, as though he has not heard these verses being read to him. So inform him, O Messenger, of what he will dislike in the Hereafter, which is a painful punishment that awaits him there."
When he comes to know something of Our messages he makes fun of them: For them is shameful punishment.,8,45,وَإِذَا عَلِمَ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِنَا شَيْـًٔا ٱتَّخَذَهَا هُزُوًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"And when something of the Qur’ān reaches him, he takes it as a joke to mock. Those attributed with this quality of mocking the Qur’ān will have a disgraceful punishment on the day of judgment."
"There is Hell before them; and whatever they have earned will not avail them in the least, nor those whom they take as friends apart from God. There is great chastisement for them.",9,45,مِّن وَرَآئِهِمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُم مَّا كَسَبُوا۟ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا مَا ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"In front of them will be the fire of hell which awaits them in the Hereafter, and the actions they earned will not help them with Allah at all nor will the idols they took to worship besides Him remove anything from them. And they will have a great punishment on the day of judgment."
This is guidance. Those who deny the revelations of their Lord will suffer a dreadful doom.,10,45,هَٰذَا هُدًى وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مِّن رِّجْزٍ أَلِيمٌ,"This book which I revealed to My Messenger Muhammad is a guide to the true path. And those who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord which were revealed to His Messenger will have a bad, painful punishment."
"It is God who subjugated the ocean for you so that ships may ply through it by His command, and you may seek His bounty, and may haply be grateful.",11,45,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلْبَحْرَ لِتَجْرِىَ ٱلْفُلْكُ فِيهِ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِهِۦ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"Allah alone is the one who subjugated for you, O people, the sea in which ships sail with His order, and so that you seek His grace through different lawful trades and so that you are thankful for Allah’s favours upon you."
"He subjugated for you whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, each and everything. Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.",12,45,وَسَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مِّنْهُ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"And He subjugated whatever is in the heavens such as the sun, moon and stars, and whatever is on earth such as rivers, trees, mountains and so forth. In subjugating that for you are proof of Allah’s power and His oneness for people who ponder over His signs and take heed from them."
"Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear the visitations of God, so that He may requite the people for their deeds.",13,45,قُل لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ يَغْفِرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ ٱللَّهِ لِيَجْزِىَ قَوْمًۢا بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ,"O Messenger, say to those who brought faith in Allah and accepted His messengers: “Forgive those who did bad to you from the disbelievers who do not hope for Allah’s reward nor do they fear His punishment, because Allah will reward both the patient believers and the transgressing disbelievers for the actions they used to earn in this world”."
He who does good does so for himself; and he who does evil suffers the consequence thereof. You have then to go back to your Lord.,14,45,مَنْ عَمِلَ صَٰلِحًا فَلِنَفْسِهِۦ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Whoever does good actions, the result of his good action is for him, And Allah is in no need of his actions. And whoever does bad, the result of his bad action is that he will be punished for it; Allah is not harmed by his bad. Then to Me alone you will be returned so I can reward everyone with what they deserve."
"We gave the children of Israel the Book, and the judgement and the prophethood, provided them with good things, favoured them over other people,",15,45,وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَٰهُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ وَفَضَّلْنَٰهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"I granted the Israelites the Torah and deciding between people according to its rule, and I made most of the prophets amongst them from the children of Abraham (peace be upon him), and I provided them with different types of good things and I granted them virtue over the worlds in their era."
"And gave them a clear exposition of Our laws. And they did not differ until after knowledge came to them, through mutual jealousies. Verily your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgement in what they differed about.",16,45,وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُم بَيِّنَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ فَمَا ٱخْتَلَفُوٓا۟ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا۟ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"And I gave them proof which clarify truth from falsehood. But they did not differ except after the proof were established against them by sending My Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). And nothing lead them to this difference except some of them oppressing others, out of greed for leadership and fame. O Messenger, your Lord will decide between them on the day of judgment what they used to differ about in the world, so He will clearly show who was right and who was wrong."
"We have put you on the right way in the matter (of divine law). So follow it, and do not follow the wishes of those who are ignorant.",17,45,ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَٰكَ عَلَىٰ شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ فَٱتَّبِعْهَا وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, then I put you on an ordained way regarding the matter of Islam and which calls them to faith and good actions. So follow this way and do not follow the desires of those who do not know the truth, and so their desires lead them away from the truth."
"They will not avail you in the least against God. Surely the wicked are each other's friends, but God befriends those who fear and follow the right path.",18,45,إِنَّهُمْ لَن يُغْنُوا۟ عَنكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِىُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Those who do not know the truth will not be able to hold back Allah’s punishment from you if you follow their desires. And the oppressors from all sects and creeds help and support one another against the believers. And Allah is the helper of those mindful of Him by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions.
"These are precepts of wisdom for men, and guidance and grace for people who believe with certainty.",19,45,هَٰذَا بَصَٰٓئِرُ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,"This Qur’ān which is revealed to My Messenger is enlightenment through which people can see truth from falsehood, guidance to the truth, and mercy for people who have conviction, because they are the ones who are guided through it to the straight path, so that their Lord is pleased with them and He then enters them into Paradise and distances them from the fire."
Do those who seek evil think that We shall make them equal in life and death to those who believe and do good? How bad is the judgement that they make!,20,45,أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱجْتَرَحُوا۟ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,"Those who commit disbelief and sins through their limbs think I will make them in reward like those who brought faith in Allah and did good deeds, making them equal in this life and the Hereafter. Wretched is this judgment of theirs."
"God has created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that He may reward each soul in accordance with what it has done; and no wrong will be done to them.",21,45,وَخَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلِتُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"And Allah created the heavens and earth with complete wisdom and He did not create it in vain, and so that each soul can be rewarded with the good or bad it earned. Allah will not oppress them by decreasing their good deeds or increasing their bad deeds."
"Just think: Who apart from God can show the way to him who deifies his ego into his god, whom God allows to go astray knowingly, and seals his ears and heart, and covers over his eyes with a veil? Why then do you not contemplate?",22,45,أَفَرَءَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُۥ هَوَىٰهُ وَأَضَلَّهُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِۦ وَقَلْبِهِۦ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِهِۦ غِشَٰوَةً فَمَن يَهْدِيهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱللَّهِ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ,"O Messenger, look at the one who followed his desires and made it like his god he cannot oppose, then Allah led him astray despite his knowledge, because he deserved to be misguided, and Allah sealed his heart so he cannot listen in a manner that benefits, and Allah put a veil on his eyes which stops him from seeing the truth. So who can enable him to the truth after Allah has led him astray? Do you not remember the harm of following desires and the benefit of following Allah’s sacred law?"
"Yet they say: ""There is nothing but the life of this world. We die and we live, and only time annihilates us."" Yet they have no knowledge of this: They only speculate.",23,45,وَقَالُوا۟ مَا هِىَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَآ إِلَّا ٱلدَّهْرُ وَمَا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ,"And the disbelievers who denied the resurrection said: “There is no life besides this worldly life of ours, so there is no life after it. Generations die never to return and other generations come to life. And only the alteration of the night and day is what makes us die”. They have no knowledge for their denial of the resurrection. They are only assuming, and assumptions are of no benefit to the truth."
"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: ""Bring our ancestors back, if what you say is true.""",24,45,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ مَّا كَانَ حُجَّتَهُمْ إِلَّآ أَن قَالُوا۟ ٱئْتُوا۟ بِـَٔابَآئِنَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"When you recite My clear verses to the idolaters who deny the resurrection, they have no proof which they can use except their saying to the Messenger (peace be upon him) and his Companions: “Bring our dead fathers back to life if you are true in your claim that we will be resurrected after our death”."
"Say: ""God, who gives you life and makes you die, will (raise the dead) then gather you (and your ancestors) together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt."" And yet most men do not understand.",25,45,قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger, say to them: “Allah gives you life by creating you from a sperm-drop, then He will give you death, then He will gather you after your death on the day of judgment for reckoning and reward. That day in whose coming there is no doubt”. But most people do not know and so they do not prepare for it with good actions."
God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. The day the Hour is proclaimed the liars will be losers.,26,45,وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَخْسَرُ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,"And to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of earth, so there is nobody to be truly worshipped in them besides Him. And on the day the Hour occurs in which Allah will raise the dead for reckoning and reward, the people of falsehood who used to worship others besides Allah, strive to refute the truth and establish falsehood, will lose."
You will see each community kneeling down; and each community will be summoned to its ledger (of good and evil deeds). You will receive upon that day your recompense for what you had done.,27,45,وَتَرَىٰ كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً كُلُّ أُمَّةٍ تُدْعَىٰٓ إِلَىٰ كِتَٰبِهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And you will see on that day, O Messenger, every nation crouching on its knees, awaiting what will be done with them. Every nation will be called towards its book of deeds which the guarding angels wrote. Today, you will be rewarded, O people, for the good and bad you used to do in the world."
"This, Our record, will speak about you truthfully. We had everything you did recorded in it.",28,45,هَٰذَا كِتَٰبُنَا يَنطِقُ عَلَيْكُم بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّا كُنَّا نَسْتَنسِخُ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"This is My book, in which My angels used to write your actions, which is speaking against you truthfully, so read it. I used to order the guarding angels to write what you used to do in the world."
"So, those who believed and did good things will be admitted to His favour by their Lord. This will be a clear triumph.",29,45,فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَيُدْخِلُهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ فِى رَحْمَتِهِۦ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"As for those who brought faith and did good actions, their Lord will enter them into Paradise through His mercy. That reward which Allah granted them is the clear success which no success can compare with."
"As for the infidels, (it will be said): ""Were not My messages read out to you? But you behaved with self-conceit, and became a sinful people.",30,45,وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَفَلَمْ تَكُنْ ءَايَٰتِى تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ وَكُنتُمْ قَوْمًا مُّجْرِمِينَ,"As for those who disbelieved in Allah, it will be said to them to rebuke them: “Were My verses not recited to you, but you were too proud to bring faith in them, and you were a transgressing people, earning disbelief and sins?”"
"Whenever it was said: 'God's promise is certainly true, and there is no doubt about the Hour,' you replied: 'We know not what the Hour is. We have only a vague idea, but are not certain.'",31,45,وَإِذَا قِيلَ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَٱلسَّاعَةُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَا قُلْتُم مَّا نَدْرِى مَا ٱلسَّاعَةُ إِن نَّظُنُّ إِلَّا ظَنًّا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُسْتَيْقِنِينَ,"When it is said to you: “Allah’s promise, in which He has promised His servants He will resurrect them and reward them, is true without doubt, and the Hour is true without doubt, so work for it”, you say: “We do not know what this Hour is. We only assume doubtfully that it is coming and we are not convinced it will come”."
"The evil of what they had done will become clear to them, and they will be seized by what they had scorned.",32,45,وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتُ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"And the evil consequences of the disbelief and sins they committed in the world will appear to them, and the punishment which they used to mock when warned of it will befall them."
"""We shall ignore you today,"" they will be told, ""as you had forgotten the meeting of this Day. Your dwelling place is Hell, and there is none to save you:",33,45,وَقِيلَ ٱلْيَوْمَ نَنسَىٰكُمْ كَمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَٰذَا وَمَأْوَىٰكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن نَّٰصِرِينَ,"Allah will say to them: “Today, I will leave you in the fire just as you forgot meeting this day of yours, and so did not prepare for it through faith and good actions. And your abode which you will take refuge in is the fire. And you do not have any helpers to repel Allah’s punishment from you."
"This because you laughed at God's revelations and were taken in by the life of the world."" So they will neither be taken out of it, nor will be asked to seek God's favour on that day.",34,45,ذَٰلِكُم بِأَنَّكُمُ ٱتَّخَذْتُمْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ هُزُوًا وَغَرَّتْكُمُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ لَا يُخْرَجُونَ مِنْهَا وَلَا هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,"That punishment you are being punished with is because you took the words of Allah as a joke which you would mock, and life with its pleasures and desires deceived you”. So today these disbelievers who used to mock Allah’s words will not be taken out of the fire, but rather they will remain in it forever, and neither will they be returned to the worldly life to do good deeds nor will their Lord be pleased with them."
"All praise be to God, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, Lord of all the worlds.",35,45,فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحَمْدُ رَبِّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَرَبِّ ٱلْأَرْضِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"So for Allah alone is praise, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, and Lord of all the creation."
His is the supremacy in the heavens and the earth; and He is the all-mighty and all-wise.,36,45,وَلَهُ ٱلْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"And for Him is grandeur and greatness in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in His creating, decreeing and planning."
HA MIM.,0,46,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ حمٓ,Ḥā Mīm. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah.
"The revelation of this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.",1,46,تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"The revelation of the Qur’ān is from Allah, the Mighty whom nobody can overpower, Wise in His creating, decreeing and planning."
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but with a purpose for an appointed time. Yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning.,2,46,مَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُوا۟ مُعْرِضُونَ,"I did not create the heavens and the earth and I did not create what is between them in vain, but rather I created all of it with truth and with complete wisdom. Amongst that is for His servants to recognise Him through them and so worship Him alone and not associate any partner with Him, and so that they fulfil the demands of their being made deputy on earth until a fixed time which Allah alone knows. And those who disbelieve in Allah are turning away from the Book of Allah they are being warned through, without paying attention to it."
"Say: ""Have you thought of those you invoke apart from God? Show me what they have created of the earth, or, do they have a share in the heavens? Bring me an earlier Book than this, or inherited knowledge, if you are truthful.""",3,46,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱئْتُونِى بِكِتَٰبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَٰذَآ أَوْ أَثَٰرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who turn away from the truth: “Tell me about your idols you worship besides Allah: what parts of the earth have they created? Have they created a mountain? Have they created a river? Or do they have partnership and a share with Allah in creating the heavens? Bring me a book revealed from Allah before the Qur’ān or some trace of knowledge which the previous people left, if you are true in your claim that your idols deserve to be worshipped”."
"Who is more astray than he who calls on those, apart from God, who cannot answer their prayers till the Day of Resurrection, and are even unaware of being called.",4,46,وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَن لَّا يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُۥٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَٰفِلُونَ,"And there is nobody more misguided than the one who worships an idol besides Allah which cannot respond to his call until the day of judgment. And these idols which they worship besides Allah are unaware of their slaves calling upon them, because they are inanimate and cannot hear, see or understand."
When all men are gathered together (on that Day) they will become their enemies and deny their worship.,5,46,وَإِذَا حُشِرَ ٱلنَّاسُ كَانُوا۟ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُوا۟ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَٰفِرِينَ,"And alongside not benefiting them in the world, when they are raised on the Day of Judgment, they will be enemies to those who used to worship them and disassociate themselves from them, and they will deny having any knowledge of their worshipping them."
"When Our clear revelations are read out to them, the infidels say of the truth, when it has come to them: ""This is pure magic.""",6,46,وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ هَٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"And when My verses which are revealed to My Messenger are read to them, the disbelievers say regarding the Qur’ān when it came to them at the hands of their Messenger: “This is clear magic. It is not revelation from Allah”."
"Do they say: ""He has fabricated it?"" Tell them: ""If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this. He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful.""",7,46,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ قُلْ إِنِ ٱفْتَرَيْتُهُۥ فَلَا تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ كَفَىٰ بِهِۦ شَهِيدًۢا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Do these idolaters say: “Muhammad has made up this Qur’ān and attributed it to Allah?” Say to them, O Messenger: “If I have made it up on my own part, you do not have power over any plan for me if Allah wants to punish me, so how can I put myself at risk of punishment by fabricating against Him? Allah knows better the criticism of His Qur’ān and slandering me you engage in. He, (may He be glorified), is sufficient as a witness between me and you. And He is Forgiving of the sins of His servants who repent to Him, Merciful to them”."
"Say: ""I am not a new Messenger to come, nor do I know what is to be done to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly.""",8,46,قُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعًا مِّنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَمَآ أَدْرِى مَا يُفْعَلُ بِى وَلَا بِكُمْ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject your prophethood: “I am not the first Messenger Allah has sent, as many messengers came before me. I do not know what Allah will do with me nor what He will do with you in this life. I only follow what Allah reveals to me, so I do not say or do except according to what He reveals. And I am only a warner who clearly warns of His punishment”."
"Tell them: ""Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it when a witness from the people of Israel had testified to the like of it and come to believe, while you spurn it?"" Assuredly God does not guide a wicked people.",9,46,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِۦ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّنۢ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِۦ فَـَٔامَنَ وَٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"O Messenger, say to these deniers: “Tell me if this Qur’ān is from Allah and you deny it, and a witness from the Israelites testifies that it is from Allah, relying on what has come regarding it in the Torah and then he brings faith in it, whilst you scorn bringing faith in it, will you not then be oppressors? Allah does not enable the oppressors to the truth”."
"Those who deny say of those who believe: ""Had there been any good in it they would not have preceded us in coming to it."" Since they have not taken guidance from it, they will say: ""This is the same old lie.""",10,46,وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَوْ كَانَ خَيْرًا مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُوا۟ بِهِۦ فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَٰذَآ إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ,"And those who denied the Qur’ān and what their Messenger brought to them say: “If what Muhammad brought was true and guides towards good, these paupers, servants and weak people would not have preceded us towards it”. And because they are not guided to what their Messenger brought them, they will say: “This which he has brought us is an old lie, and we do not follow lies”."
"There was the Book of Moses before this, a guide and a mercy; and here is this Book confirming it in lucid language, warning those who are wicked, and giving happy tidings to the righteous.",11,46,وَمِن قَبْلِهِۦ كِتَٰبُ مُوسَىٰٓ إِمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً وَهَٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّسَانًا عَرَبِيًّا لِّيُنذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"And before this Qur’ān is the Torah, the book which Allah revealed on Moses (peace be upon him) as a leader to be followed in the truth and as a mercy for those who believe in it and follow it amongst the Israelites. And this Qur’ān which has been revealed upon Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a book which confirms the books before it, in the Arabic language, so that he can warn through it those who wronged themselves through associating partners with Allah and by committing sins, and it is a glad tiding to the good-doers who made their relationship with their Creator and their relationship with His creation good."
"Surely for those who say, ""God is our Lord,"" and then remain firm, there is no fear or regret.",12,46,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Indeed, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah; we have no Lord besides Him”, then they become firm on faith and good actions, there will be no fear on them in what they face in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over the fortune of this worlds which escaped them or what they left behind them."
They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever as a recompense for what they had done.,13,46,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Those who are attributed with those qualities are the people of Paradise who will live in it forever, as a reward for them for their good deeds that they sent forward in the world."
"We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: His mother carries him in her womb with hardship, and gives birth to him in pain. Thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him. When he attains to manhood and the age of forty, he says: ""O Lord, guide me to thank You for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and to do things good as may please You, and give me a righteous off-spring. I turn to You in penitence and submit.""",14,46,وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ بِوَٰلِدَيْهِ إِحْسَٰنًا حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُۥ كُرْهًا وَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهًا وَحَمْلُهُۥ وَفِصَٰلُهُۥ ثَلَٰثُونَ شَهْرًا حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُۥ وَبَلَغَ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً قَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِىٓ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَٰلِحًا تَرْضَىٰهُ وَأَصْلِحْ لِى فِى ذُرِّيَّتِىٓ إِنِّى تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَإِنِّى مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"And I commanded man with emphasis that he should be kind to his parents and that he should be righteous towards them in their lifetime and after their death with what does not oppose the sacred law. And in particular his mother who carried him with difficulty and gave birth to him with difficulty. And the length of his gestation period in which he remained and the beginning of his weaning is thirty months. Until when he reaches the completion of his mental and physical strength, he says: “My Lord, inspire me to thank You for Your favour you have done to me and my parents, and inspire me to do good actions which please you, and accept them from me. And correct my children for me. I have repented to You from my sins and I am amongst those who submit to Your obedience and surrender to Your commands”."
"They are those from whom We accept the very best of what they have done, and overlook their faults. They will be among the inmates of Paradise: A true promise they have been made.",15,46,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَتَقَبَّلُ عَنْهُمْ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَنَتَجَاوَزُ عَن سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ فِىٓ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَعْدَ ٱلصِّدْقِ ٱلَّذِى كَانُوا۟ يُوعَدُونَ,"Those are the ones from whom I accept the good deeds they did and overlook their sins, so I do not seize them due to them. And they are amongst the people of Paradise. This promise they have been given is a true promise which will definitely occur."
"But he who says to his parents: ""Shame on you: You intimidate me that I will be resurrected when many generations will have passed before me?"" And (the parents) would implore God's help: ""Woe to you. You better believe. The promise of God is certainly true."" Yet he answers: ""These are only fables of long ago.""",16,46,وَٱلَّذِى قَالَ لِوَٰلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِىٓ أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ ٱلْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى وَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ ٱللَّهَ وَيْلَكَ ءَامِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَيَقُولُ مَا هَٰذَآ إِلَّآ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"And the one who said to his parents: “Woe unto you. Do you promise me that I will be taken out of my grave alive after I die, whereas many nations have passed in which people died, but none of them was raised alive?” And his parents are seeking help from Allah to guide their son towards faith, and they say to their son: “Woe unto you if you do not bring faith on the resurrection, so bring faith in it. Allah’s promise of resurrection is true without doubt”. But he says, renewing his denial of the resurrection: “This which is said regarding the resurrection is nothing but something related from the books of the previous people and what they wrote. It is not proven from Allah”."
They are those on whom the sentence of God would be justified as on communities of jinns and men before them. They will surely perish.,17,46,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ فِىٓ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ خَٰسِرِينَ,"Those are the ones for whom punishment is established amongst the nations before them from the jinns and men. They were the losers, as they lost themselves and their children by entering the fire."
Each will have a position in accordance with his deeds; and no wrong will be done to them.,18,46,وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَٰتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُوا۟ وَلِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ,"And for each group - the group of Paradise and the group of the fire - are ranks according to their actions. The ranks of the people of Paradise are high ranks, whilst the ranks of the people of the fire are low ranks. And so that Allah gives them the full reward of their actions, and they will not be oppressed on the day of judgment by their good deeds being decreased or their bad deeds being increased."
"The day the unbelievers are brought to the Fire, (it will be said): ""You wasted all your good deeds in the life of the world, and enjoyed them to the full. You will now be requited with a shameful punishment, for you behaved with arrogance for no reason on the earth, and acted wickedly.""",19,46,وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَٰتِكُمْ فِى حَيَاتِكُمُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ,"On the day when those who rejected Allah and His messengers will be exposed to the Fire to be punished in it, it will be said to them in rebuke: “You have finished your good things in your worldly life and you enjoyed the pleasures it contained. On this day, you will be rewarded with the punishment which will disgrace and shame you due to your arrogance on earth unjustly, and due to your leaving the obedience of Allah through disbelief and sins”."
"Remember (Hud) the brother of 'Ad. When he warned his people in Ahqaf -- though many a warner had come and gone before and after him: ""Do not worship any one but God, for I fear the punishment of an awful day for you,""",20,46,وَٱذْكُرْ أَخَا عَادٍ إِذْ أَنذَرَ قَوْمَهُۥ بِٱلْأَحْقَافِ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ ٱلنُّذُرُ مِنۢ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِۦٓ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"O Messenger, remember Hud, the brother of Ad in lineage, when he warned his people of Allah’s punishment befalling them, when they were in their homes in Ahqaf in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, and messengers to warn their people had already passed before Hud and after him, saying to their people: “Do not worship anyone except Allah alone; do not worship anything besides Him. O people, I fear for you the punishment of a great day, which is the day of judgment”."
"They said: ""Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring upon us what you predict for us, if you are a man of truth.""",21,46,قَالُوٓا۟ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَأْفِكَنَا عَنْ ءَالِهَتِنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"His people said to him: “Have you come to us to turn us away from worshipping our gods? That will never happen for you, so bring us the punishment you promise us if you are true in what you claim”."
"He said: ""Only God has the knowledge. I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I see you are a foolish people.""",22,46,قَالَ إِنَّمَا ٱلْعِلْمُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبَلِّغُكُم مَّآ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِۦ وَلَٰكِنِّىٓ أَرَىٰكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ,"He said: “The knowledge of the time for punishment is only with Allah and I do not have any knowledge of it. I am only a messenger who conveys to you what I have been sent with towards you. However, I see you as a people who are unaware of what contains benefit for you, so you leave it, and of what contains harm for you, so you commit it”."
"So when they saw it as a cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said: ""This is just a passing cloud that will bring us rain."" ""No. It is what you were trying to hasten: The wind which carries the grievous punishment!",23,46,فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضًا مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا بَلْ هُوَ مَا ٱسْتَعْجَلْتُم بِهِۦ رِيحٌ فِيهَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Then when the punishment they hastened for came to them, and they saw a cloud appearing in one direction of the sky, heading towards their valleys, they said: “This is a cloud which will bring us rain”. Hud said to them: “The matter is not as you think, i.e., that it is a cloud which will rain upon you, but rather it is the punishment you hastened for. It is a wind which contains a painful punishment”."
"It will destroy everything at the bidding of its Lord."" So in the morning there was nothing but their empty dwellings to be seen. That is how We requite the sinners.",24,46,تُدَمِّرُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍۭ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّهَا فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ لَا يُرَىٰٓ إِلَّا مَسَٰكِنُهُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Destroying everything it passed by which Allah ordered to be destroyed, so they were destroyed, only their houses in which they lived being visible, bearing witness to their inhabiting them before. With this kind of painful punishment, I punish the transgressors who persist in their disbelief and sins."
"We had strengthened them as We have not strengthened you, had given them ears and eyes and hearts; but nothing stood them in good stead, neither their ears nor eyes nor hearts, for they rejected the signs of God, and were seized by what they had mocked.",25,46,وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَّٰهُمْ فِيمَآ إِن مَّكَّنَّٰكُمْ فِيهِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعًا وَأَبْصَٰرًا وَأَفْـِٔدَةً فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلَآ أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ وَلَآ أَفْـِٔدَتُهُم مِّن شَىْءٍ إِذْ كَانُوا۟ يَجْحَدُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"And I granted the people of Hud the means of establishment which I have not given you, and I gave them hearing to hear with, vision to see with and hearts to understand with. But their hearing did not benefit them at all, nor did their vision or intellects. They did not repel Allah’s punishment from them when it came to them, as they used to disbelieve in Allah’s signs, and the punishment which they used to mock and which their prophet Hud (peace be upon him) used to warn them of befell them."
"We have destroyed habitations all around you, having explained Our signs in different ways to them that they may turn back.",26,46,وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَصَرَّفْنَا ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"And I destroyed the cities around you, O people of Makkah; I destroyed Ad, Thamud, the people of Lot and the people of Madyan, and I gave them different proof and evidence, in the hope they will return from their disbelief."
"Why then did the gods they had taken apart from God as propitiators, not come to their aid? In fact they strayed away from them. It was all a lie what they had contrived!",27,46,فَلَوْلَا نَصَرَهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قُرْبَانًا ءَالِهَةًۢ بَلْ ضَلُّوا۟ عَنْهُمْ وَذَٰلِكَ إِفْكُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ,"So why did their idols which they took as gods besides Allah and which they used to seek closeness to through worship and sacrifice not help them? They did not help them at all, but in fact they disappeared from them when they needed them the most. And that is the lie and fabrication they did to themselves, i.e., that these idols will benefit them and intercede for them with Allah."
"And (remember), when We turned a company of jinns towards you to listen to the Qur'an, they arrived when it was being recited, and they said: ""Keep silent."" When it was over they came back to their people, warning them:",28,46,وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَرًا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُوٓا۟ أَنصِتُوا۟ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْا۟ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ,"Remember, O Messenger, when I sent to you a group of the jinn to listen to the Qur’ān that was revealed to you. When they came to hear it they said to one another: Be quiet, so that we are able to hear it. When the Messenger (peace be upon him) completed his recitation they went back to their people to warn them of Allah’s punishment if they do not have faith in this Qur’ān."
"""O our people:"" they said: ""we have listened to a Book which has come down after Moses, confirming what was (sent down) before it, showing the way to the truth and a path that is straight.",29,46,قَالُوا۟ يَٰقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَٰبًا أُنزِلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ يَهْدِىٓ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِلَىٰ طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"They said to them: O our people, we have heard a book that Allah has revealed after Moses, confirming the previous scriptures revealed by Allah. This book that we heard guides to the truth and it guides to a straight path, which is the path of Islam."
"O our people, hearken to the summoner of God, and believe in him, so that He may forgive you your sins and save you from a painful doom.",30,46,يَٰقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُوا۟ دَاعِىَ ٱللَّهِ وَءَامِنُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَغْفِرْ لَكُم مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُجِرْكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"O our people, respond to the truth that Muhammad calls you towards and believe that he is a messenger from his Lord, and Allah will forgive your sins and save you from a painful punishment that awaits you if you do not respond to the truth that he calls you towards and do not believe that he is a messenger from his Lord."
"He who does not listen to the summoner of God cannot weaken (the power of) God on earth, nor will he have protectors other than Him. They are clearly in the wrong.""",31,46,وَمَن لَّا يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ ٱللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَيْسَ لَهُۥ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءُ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Those who do not respond to the truth that Muhammad (peace be upon him) calls them towards will not be able to render Allah helpless and escape from Him by fleeing on earth and they will not have besides Allah any protectors to rescue them from the punishment. Such people have clearly deviated from the truth.
"Do they not realise that God who created the heavens and the earth, and did not tire creating them, is able to bring the dead to life? And why not? He has the power over everything.",32,46,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَلَمْ يَعْىَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَٰدِرٍ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يُحْۦِىَ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بَلَىٰٓ إِنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Do these idolaters who deny the resurrection not understand that Allah Who created the heavens and created the earth, and did not tire in creating them despite their hugeness and vastness, is able to give life to the dead for reckoning and recompense? Indeed, He is able to bring them to life. He, (may He be glorified), is able to do all things and He is not incapable of bringing the dead to life."
"The day the unbelievers will be stood before the Fire, (they will be asked:) ""Is this not the reality?"" They will answer: ""In truth, by our Lord!"" It will be said: ""Then taste the torment of what you had denied.""",33,46,وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ أَلَيْسَ هَٰذَا بِٱلْحَقِّ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّنَا قَالَ فَذُوقُوا۟ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,"On the day when those who rejected Allah and His messengers will be exposed to the Fire to be punished in it, it will be said to them in rebuke: Is this punishment that you are seeing not real? Or is it a lie like how you used to say in the world? They will say: Indeed, by Our Lord, it is real. It will then be said them: Taste the punishment on account of your denial of Allah."
"So bear with patience, as the apostles who were constant, bore; and do not be hasty (in demanding punishment) for them. On the day they see what they had been foretold, (they will realise) that they did not stay in the world but only an hour of the day. This is the message to be conveyed: Shall any perish but the ungodly?",34,46,فَٱصْبِرْ كَمَا صَبَرَ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعَزْمِ مِنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَلَا تَسْتَعْجِل لَّهُمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِّن نَّهَارٍۭ بَلَٰغٌ فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلَّا ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"So be patient - O Messenger - against your people’s denial of you just as the messengers of firm resolve were patient. These were the following messengers in addition to our Prophet (peace be upon him): Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them). Do not seek to hasten the punishment for them. The deniers from your people, on the day when they will see the punishment that they are warned about in the Hereafter, will be as if they did not remain in the world except for an hour of a day due to the length of their punishment. This Qur’ān that is revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a notice to all people as well to the jinn, and only those who go against Allah by disbelief and sins will be destroyed by the punishment."
THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE and obstruct (others) from the way of God will have wasted their deeds.,0,47,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَضَلَّ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"Those who reject Allah and turn people away from Allah’s religion, Allah will nullify their deeds."
"But those who believe and do the right, and believe what has been revealed to Muhammad, which is the truth from their Lord, will have their faults condoned by Him and their state improved.",1,47,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَءَامَنُوا۟ بِمَا نُزِّلَ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ كَفَّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ وَأَصْلَحَ بَالَهُمْ,"Those who have faith in Allah and do righteous deeds, and have faith in what Allah has revealed to His Messenger Muhammad - and what He has revealed to His Messenger Muhammad is the truth from their Lord - He will remit from them their wrongdoings and wont take them to task, and He will set right their affairs in this world and the Hereafter."
That is because those who refuse to believe only follow what is false; but those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. That is how God gives men precepts of wisdom.,2,47,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱتَّبَعُوا۟ ٱلْبَٰطِلَ وَأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّبَعُوا۟ ٱلْحَقَّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ كَذَٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ أَمْثَٰلَهُمْ,"That mentioned recompense for the two groups is because those who reject Allah followed falsehood, and those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger followed the truth from their Lord. Thus, their recompense differs just as their efforts differed. Just as Allah showed His decision about the two groups, the group of the believers and the group of the disbelievers, Allah gives people their examples, so that similar things are linked."
"So, when you clash with the unbelievers, smite their necks until you overpower them, then hold them in bondage. Then either free them graciously or after taking a ransom, until war shall have come to end. If God had pleased He could have punished them (Himself), but He wills to test some of you through some others. He will not allow the deeds of those who are killed in the cause of God to go waste.",3,47,فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَضَرْبَ ٱلرِّقَابِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّوا۟ ٱلْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّۢا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّىٰ تَضَعَ ٱلْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَٰلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ لَٱنتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَا۟ بَعْضَكُم بِبَعْضٍ وَٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"When you, O believers, face those disbelievers who wage war against you then strike their necks with your swords, and persist in fighting them until you subdue them and eradicate their power. Once you have subdue them, tie the chains of the captives. When you capture them you have the option, as per the demand of interests, of being graceful to them by releasing them for no ransom, ransoming them for wealth or something else, killing them, or enslaving them. Continue fighting and capturing them until the war ends by the disbelievers’ accepting Islam or by your entering into a treaty with them. The mentioned trial of the believers with the disbelievers, the alternation of fortunes and the victory of one over the other, is Allah’s decision. If Allah willed to defeat the disbelievers without a fight, He would have done so, but He ordained striving in His path to test some of you with others. He tests who of the believers fights and who doesn’t. He tests the disbeliever with the believer: If the believer is killed he enters Paradise and if the believer kills him he enters the fire. Those who are killed in Allah’s path, Allah will never nullify their deeds."
"He will show them the way, and better their state,",4,47,سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ,He will enable them to follow the truth in their worldly life and He will set right their affairs.
And will admit them into gardens with which he has acquainted them.,5,47,وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ,"He will enter them into Paradise on the day of resurrection, whose description He gave them in the world so they recognised it and He showed them their places in it in the Hereafter."
"O you who believe, if you help (in the cause of) God He will surely come to your aid, and firmly plant your feet.",6,47,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن تَنصُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who acted on what He ordained for them, if you help Allah by helping His prophet and his religion, and by fighting the disbelievers, He will help you by granting you dominance over them and He will keep your feet firm in battle when you face them."
"As for the unbelievers, they will suffer misfortunes, and their deeds will be rendered ineffective.",7,47,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فَتَعْسًا لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,For those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger there is loss and destruction and Allah will nullify the reward of their deeds.
"That is so as they were averse to what has been revealed by God, and their actions will be nullified.",8,47,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَرِهُوا۟ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"That punishment that will befall them is because they detested the Qur’ān that Allah revealed to His prophet because it contained the mention of Allah’s Oneness, so Allah destroyed their deeds and they were losers in the world and the Hereafter."
Have they not journeyed in the land and seen the fate of those before them? Destroyed they were utterly by God; and a similar (fate) awaits the unbelievers.,9,47,أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ دَمَّرَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَٰفِرِينَ أَمْثَٰلُهَا,Have these deniers not travelled the earth and reflected over what was the end of those who had denied before them. It was a painful end. Allah destroyed their homes above them and destroyed them as well as their children and wealth. Disbelievers in every time and place will receive similar punishment.
This is so for God is the friend of those who believe while the unbelievers have no friend.,10,47,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَوْلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَأَنَّ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ لَا مَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,"That mentioned recompense is for the two groups, because Allah helps those who have faith in Him and because the disbelievers have no one to help them."
"Verily God will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of water running by. But the unbelievers revel and carouse and subsist like beasts, and Hell will be their residence.",11,47,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ ٱلْأَنْعَٰمُ وَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ,"Allah will enter those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger and who do righteous deeds into gardens under whose palaces and trees rivers will flow. Those who reject Allah and His Messenger enjoy in the world by pursuing their desires and they eat like how cattle eat. They have no concern other than their stomachs and private parts. On the day of resurrection, the Fire will be their home to which they will go."
"How many were the habitations, mightier than your city which has turned you out, which We destroyed; and they did not have a helper.",12,47,وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَخْرَجَتْكَ أَهْلَكْنَٰهُمْ فَلَا نَاصِرَ لَهُمْ,"How many a town from the towns of the previous nations had more strength, wealth and children than that of Makkah, whose people evicted you from it! I destroyed them when they denied their messengers, and they had no helper to rescue them from Allah’s punishment when it came to them. Thus we are not unable to destroy the people of Makkah if I intend to do so."
"Can one who stands on a clear proof from his Lord, be like one enamoured of his evil deeds and follows his inane desires?",13,47,أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ كَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُۥ سُوٓءُ عَمَلِهِۦ وَٱتَّبَعُوٓا۟ أَهْوَآءَهُم,"Are those who have clear proof and glaring evidence from their Lord, and therefore worship Him with insight, like those for whom Satan has beautified their evil action, and they followed what their desires dictated to them by the worship of idols, the commission of sin and denial of the messengers?"
"The semblance of Paradise promised the pious and devout (is that of a garden) with streams of water that will not go rank, and rivers of milk whose taste will not undergo a change, and rivers of wine delectable to drinkers, and streams of purified honey, and fruits of every kind in them, and forgiveness of their Lord. Are these like those who will live for ever in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestines to shreds?",14,47,مَّثَلُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِى وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ فِيهَآ أَنْهَٰرٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ ءَاسِنٍ وَأَنْهَٰرٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُۥ وَأَنْهَٰرٌ مِّنْ خَمْرٍ لَّذَّةٍ لِّلشَّٰرِبِينَ وَأَنْهَٰرٌ مِّنْ عَسَلٍ مُّصَفًّى وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ كَمَنْ هُوَ خَٰلِدٌ فِى ٱلنَّارِ وَسُقُوا۟ مَآءً حَمِيمًا فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ,"The description of Paradise, which Allah has promised those who are mindful of Him, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, that He will make them enter is as follows: In it there are rivers of water whose smell and taste have not changed due to standing for long. In it there are rivers of milk whose taste has not changed. In it there are rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey that has been purified from all impurities. Therein they will get all types of fruit that they wish for. Above all of that they will receive an obliteration of their sins from Allah, Who will not take them to task for them. Can the person who has this recompense be equal to those who will remain in the Fire never to come out, and who will be given extremely hot water to drink, which will cut the intestines of their stomachs due to its extreme heat?"
"There are some who listen to you; but as soon as they go from you they say to those who were given knowledge: ""What is this he is saying now?"" They are those whose hearts have been sealed by God, and they follow their own lusts.",15,47,وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا خَرَجُوا۟ مِنْ عِندِكَ قَالُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ مَاذَا قَالَ ءَانِفًا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱتَّبَعُوٓا۟ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ,"Some of the hypocrites listen to you, O Messenger, but without acceptance and instead turn away, until when they leave your presence they say to those whom Allah had given knowledge: ‘What did he say in his talk just now?’ pretending to be ignorant and turning away. They are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed, and thus no good reaches it, and they follow their desires, which have made them blind to the truth."
"But those who are rightly guided will be given greater guidance by Him, and they will have their intrinsic piety.",16,47,وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱهْتَدَوْا۟ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَىٰهُمْ تَقْوَىٰهُمْ,"Those who are guided to the path of truth and to follow what the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought, their Lord increases them in guidance and direction to the truth, and He inspires them to do that which will protect them from the fire."
"Do they wait for any thing but the Hour (of change), that it may come upon them suddenly? Its signs have already appeared. How then will they be warned when it has come upon them?",17,47,فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا ٱلسَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَآءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمْ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَىٰهُمْ,"Are the disbelievers waiting for anything but the hour to come on them suddenly without their having any prior knowledge of it? Its signs have already come, such as the mission of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the splitting of the moon. How will they then take heed when the hour comes? It is unlikely that the reminder will be of benefit to them."
"Know then, therefore, there is no god but He, and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women. God knows your wanderings and your destination.",18,47,فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنۢبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمْ وَمَثْوَىٰكُمْ,"Be certain, O Messenger, that there is no being deserving of worship besides Allah and seek from Allah forgiveness for your sins. Seek forgiveness from Him for the sins of the believing men and women. Allah knows your movements in the day and your resting place at night. Nothing is hidden from Him."
"Those who believe say: ""How is it no Surah was revealed?"" But when a categorical Surah is revealed that mentions war, you should see those who are sceptical staring at you like a man in the swoon of death. Alas the woe for them!",19,47,وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَإِذَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا ٱلْقِتَالُ رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ نَظَرَ ٱلْمَغْشِىِّ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَأَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,"Those who have faith in Allah say, longing for Allah to reveal to His Messenger a sūrah containing the instruction for fighting: ‘Why does not Allah reveal a sūrah in which fighting is mentioned.’ When Allah reveals a decisive unabrogated sūrah containing the mention of fighting, you, O Messenger, will see those hypocrites in whose hearts there is doubt looking at you like one who is unconscious on account of extreme fear and terror. So woe to them for withdrawing from fighting and being afraid of it."
Obedience and modest speech (would have been more becoming). And when the matter has been determined it is best for them to be true to God.,20,47,طَاعَةٌ وَقَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ فَإِذَا عَزَمَ ٱلْأَمْرُ فَلَوْ صَدَقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ,"To follow Allah’s instruction and to utter fitting words that are not unseemly is better for them. When fighting is imposed and the matter becomes serious, if they are true to Allah, in their having faith in Him and following Him, it would be better for them than hypocrisy and going against Allah’s instructions."
Is it possible that if placed in authority you will create disorder in the land and sever your bonds of relationship?,21,47,فَهَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ أَن تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَتُقَطِّعُوٓا۟ أَرْحَامَكُمْ,"It is most probable that if you turn away from having faith in Allah and following Him, you will make mischief on earth by disbelief and sins, and you will cut family ties, just as you used to do in the period of ignorance."
"They are those who were condemned by God, whose ears were blocked by Him and their eyes blinded.",22,47,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَأَصَمَّهُمْ وَأَعْمَىٰٓ أَبْصَٰرَهُمْ,"Those who are described as making mischief on earth and cutting family ties are the ones whom Allah has distanced from His mercy, whose ears He has made deaf to hearing the truth with acceptance and submission, and whose sight He has blinded from seeing it with reflection."
Do they not ponder on what the Qur'an says? Or have their hearts been sealed with locks?,23,47,أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَآ,"Will these people who turn away not ponder over the Qur’ān and reflect over what is in it? If they pondered over it, it will guide them to every good and will distance them from every evil. Or are there locks on the hearts of these people that are tightly closed, so that no advice reaches them and no reminder benefits them?"
"Those who turn their backs after the way of guidance has been opened to them, have been surely tempted by Satan and beguiled by illusory hopes.",24,47,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱرْتَدُّوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَدْبَٰرِهِم مِّنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَى ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ سَوَّلَ لَهُمْ وَأَمْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,"Those who turn back from their belief towards disbelief and hypocrisy, after the proof has been established for them and the truth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) has become clear to them, Satan is the one who has beautified for them disbelief and hypocrisy and has raised distant hopes in them."
"This was so because they said to those who disdain what God has revealed: ""We shall obey you in some things."" But God knows their secret intentions well.",25,47,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا۟ لِلَّذِينَ كَرِهُوا۟ مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ سَنُطِيعُكُمْ فِى بَعْضِ ٱلْأَمْرِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِسْرَارَهُمْ,Such deviation occurred to them because they secretly said to the idolaters who hate the revelation that He had sent down to His messenger: We will follow you in some matters such as impeding the fighting. Allah knows what they keep hidden and what they make public. Nothing is hidden from Him and He will make apparent whatever He wishes to His messenger.
How will it be when the angels draw out their souls striking their faces and their backs?,26,47,فَكَيْفَ إِذَا تَوَفَّتْهُمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَٰرَهُمْ,"What will you think of the punishment and the gruesome state they will be in when the angels assigned to remove their souls will remove them, striking their faces and backs with steel hammers."
"Because they followed what displeases God, and they were averse to pleasing Him. So We nullified their deeds.",27,47,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمُ ٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَآ أَسْخَطَ ٱللَّهَ وَكَرِهُوا۟ رِضْوَٰنَهُۥ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"That severe punishment that will occur when their souls are removed is because they followed everything that brought Allah’s wrath on them, such as disbelief, hypocrisy, opposition to Allah and His messenger, and they hated what brings them close to their Lord and draws down on them His pleasure, such as faith in Allah and following His messenger. Thus Allah nullified their deeds."
"Do they whose minds are filled with doubt, think that God will not expose their malice?",28,47,أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ أَن لَّن يُخْرِجَ ٱللَّهُ أَضْغَٰنَهُمْ,"Do those hypocrites in whose hearts there is doubt think that Allah will not bring out and expose their malice? He will certainly bring it out by testing them with trials to distinguish the person who is true in faith from the one who is false, and so that the believer becomes apparent and the hypocrite is exposed."
"Had We pleased We could have shown them to you that you could know them by their marks, and recognise them from the way they twist their words. Yet God knows all your deeds.",29,47,وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَأَرَيْنَٰكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَٰهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ أَعْمَٰلَكُمْ,"If I wished to point out the hypocrites to you, O Messenger, I would have shown them to you and you would have recognised them by their marks. You will soon recognise them by their manner of speech. Allah knows your deeds. Nothing of them is hidden from Him and He will recompense you for the same."
"We shall try you in order to know who are the fighters among you, and who are men of fortitude, and verify your histories.",30,47,وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّىٰ نَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَا۟ أَخْبَارَكُمْ,"I will test you, O believers, with striving in Allah’s path and fighting and killing the enemy until I know - in a manner that makes it apparent to the servants - those of you who strive in Allah’s path, and those of you who are steadfast in fighting the enemy. I will test you so that I know those of you who are sincere and those who are false."
"Surely those who do not believe, and obstruct others from the path of God, and oppose the Prophet after the way of guidance has been opened to them, will not hurt God in the least, and He will nullify all that they have done.",31,47,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَشَآقُّوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ لَن يَضُرُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ شَيْـًٔا وَسَيُحْبِطُ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"Those who reject Allah and His messenger, who abstain from Allah’s religion themselves and also prevent others from it, and who go against the Messenger and oppose him after it has become clear that he is a prophet, they do not harm Allah. They only harm themselves, and Allah will nullify their deeds."
"O you who believe, obey God and the Prophet, and do not waste your deeds.",32,47,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَلَا تُبْطِلُوٓا۟ أَعْمَٰلَكُمْ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He ordained, follow Allah and follow the Messenger by fulfilling their instructions and avoiding their prohibitions, and do not nullify your deeds by disbelief and ostentation."
"Those who do not believe and obstruct others from the way of God, and die disbelieving, will not be pardoned by God.",33,47,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ مَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah and turned themselves as well as people away from Allah’s religion, and then passed away as disbelievers without repenting, Allah will not overlook their sins by covering them, rather He will take them to task for it and He will enter them into the Fire to remain there forever."
"So do not become weak-kneed and sue for peace, for you will have the upper hand as God is with you and will not overlook your deeds.",34,47,فَلَا تَهِنُوا۟ وَتَدْعُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلسَّلْمِ وَأَنتُمُ ٱلْأَعْلَوْنَ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَكُمْ وَلَن يَتِرَكُمْ أَعْمَٰلَكُمْ,"So do not become weak, O believers, in confronting your enemy, and call them to peace before they call you to it, when you are dominant and have the upper hand over them. Allah is with you with His help and support. He will not reduce the reward of your deeds at all. Instead, He will give you an increase in it out of His bounty."
"Verily the life of this world is no more than a sport and frivolity. If you believe and fear God, he will give you your reward, and will not ask for your possessions.",35,47,إِنَّمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُوا۟ وَتَتَّقُوا۟ يُؤْتِكُمْ أُجُورَكُمْ وَلَا يَسْـَٔلْكُمْ أَمْوَٰلَكُمْ,"The life of the world is only play and amusement. An intelligent person should not become occupied by it instead of working for his Hereafter. If you have faith in Allah and His messenger, and you are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions, He will give you the reward of your deeds in full without any reduction, and He will not ask you for all of your wealth. He will only ask you for the Zakat."
"If He asks for all you possess and insist upon it, you will become niggardly, and it will bring out your malevolence.",36,47,إِن يَسْـَٔلْكُمُوهَا فَيُحْفِكُمْ تَبْخَلُوا۟ وَيُخْرِجْ أَضْغَٰنَكُمْ,"If He had to ask you for all of your wealth and insist in this request from you, you will become miserly with it, and He will bring out the greed and miserliness in your hearts. Thus that fact He is not asking it from you is out of kindness."
"Beware! You are called to spend in the way of God, yet some among you close their fists. But he who is niggardly is so for his own self: God is above need, and it is you who are needy. If you turn away then God will bring other people in your place who, moreover, will not be like you.",37,47,هَٰٓأَنتُمْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ تُدْعَوْنَ لِتُنفِقُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَمِنكُم مَّن يَبْخَلُ وَمَن يَبْخَلْ فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَن نَّفْسِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ ٱلْغَنِىُّ وَأَنتُمُ ٱلْفُقَرَآءُ وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْا۟ يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُونُوٓا۟ أَمْثَٰلَكُم,"Here you are being called to spend a part of your wealth in Allah’s path, and you are not asked to spend all your wealth. Some of you desist from the required spending out of miserliness. Whoever is too miserly to spend a portion of his wealth in Allah’s path, is actually being miserly to his own detriment, as he is depriving himself of the reward of spending. Allah is the Self-sufficient Who is not in need of your spending. You are the ones in need of Him. If you turn back from Islam to disbelief, He will destroy you and bring a people besides you. Then they will not be like you, but they will be obedient to Him."
WE HAVE GIVEN you a splendent victory,0,48,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُّبِينًا,"I have given you, O Messenger, a clear victory by the Treaty of Hudaibiyya."
"That God may save you from earlier and subsequent blames, and complete His favours on you, and guide you on the straight path,",1,48,لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ ٱللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنۢبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ وَيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكَ وَيَهْدِيَكَ صِرَٰطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا,"So that Allah may forgive you for your sins before this victory and after it and complete His favour on you by assisting your religion and guiding you to a straight path, in which there is no crookedness, which is the straight path of Islam."
And help you with surpassing help.,2,48,وَيَنصُرَكَ ٱللَّهُ نَصْرًا عَزِيزًا,Allah will help you against your enemies with a mighty assistance that no one can remove.
"It is He who sent down the sense of security into the hearts of believers so that their faith may increase with belief, -- God's are the armies of the heavens and the earth; and God is all-knowing and all-wise; --",3,48,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ ٱلسَّكِينَةَ فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ لِيَزْدَادُوٓا۟ إِيمَٰنًا مَّعَ إِيمَٰنِهِمْ وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"Allah is the One Who sent down stability and tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they increase in faith over and above their faith. To Allah alone belongs the forces of the heavens and the earth, He supports with them whoever of His servants He wishes. Allah knows the interests of His servants and He is Wise in the assistance and support that He gives."
"And that He may admit men and women who believe into gardens with rivers running by, to live for ever there, and absolve their evil, -- This, in the sight of God, will be the great fulfilment --",4,48,لِّيُدْخِلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَيُكَفِّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِمْ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا,"To enter those men and women who have faith in Allah and in His Messenger into gardens with streams flowing under their palaces and trees, and obliterate from them their wrongdoings and not take them to task for it. That which has been mentioned - about the attainment of the objective of Paradise and removal of the dreaded culpability for wrongdoings - in the sight of Allah is a great success that no other success can come close to."
"And that He may punish men and women (who are) hypocrites, and idolaters and idolatresses who entertain evil notions of God: It is against them that the wheel of misfortune will turn, and God will be wroth with them, and condemn them. For them He has prepared Hell, an evil destination!",5,48,وَيُعَذِّبَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقَٰتِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَٱلْمُشْرِكَٰتِ ٱلظَّآنِّينَ بِٱللَّهِ ظَنَّ ٱلسَّوْءِ عَلَيْهِمْ دَآئِرَةُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَنَهُمْ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيرًا,"And to punish the hypocrites, male and female, and to punish those men and women who ascribe partners to Allah, and who think that Allah will not assist His religion and not raise His word, and that fortune will turn against the believers, but fortune turned against them. Allah became angry with them because of their disbelief and evil thought and He expelled them from His mercy and prepared for them in the afterlife Hell, which they will enter to remain there forever. What a miserable place of return for them!"
For God's are the armies of the heavens and the earth; and God is all-knowing and all-wise.,6,48,وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,"To Allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. He supports with it whoever of His servants He wishes. Allah is Mighty Whom none can overcome; Wise in His creation, estimation and planning."
"We have sent you as witness (of the truth) and harbinger of good news and a warner,",7,48,إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ شَٰهِدًا وَمُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا,"I have sent you - O Messenger - as a witness to give testimony against your nation on the day of resurrection, and as one to give good news to the believers of the victory and empowerment Allah has prepared for them in the world, and of the bliss He has prepared for them in the Hereafter, and to warn the disbelievers of the humiliation and defeat at the hands of the believers that He has prepared for them in the world, and the painful punishment awaiting them that He has prepared for them in the Hereafter,"
"So that (men) may believe in God and His Apostle, and honour Him and revere Him, and sing His praises morning and evening.",8,48,لِّتُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَتُعَزِّرُوهُ وَتُوَقِّرُوهُ وَتُسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا,"in the hope that you have faith in Allah and have faith in His messenger, and you revere and honour His messenger, and that you glorify Allah at the beginning and at the end of the day."
Those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to God; and God's protection is over them. Then whosoever breaks the promise breaks it to his own loss; but whosoever fulfills the promise made to God will receive a great reward from Him.,9,48,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَايِعُونَكَ إِنَّمَا يُبَايِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَمَن نَّكَثَ فَإِنَّمَا يَنكُثُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِۦ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِمَا عَٰهَدَ عَلَيْهُ ٱللَّهَ فَسَيُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا,"Those who pledge the allegiance of Al-Ridwan to you, O Messenger, to fight the idolaters of Makkah, are only pledging allegiance to Allah, because He is the One Who instructed them to fight the idolaters and He is the One Who will give them recompense. The hand of Allah is over their hands at the time of the pledge and He is aware of them. Nothing of theirs is hidden from them. Whoever breaks his pledge and does not fulfil the promise he made with Allah to assist His religion, then his breaking his pledge and promise is to his own detriment. Allah is not harmed by that. Whoever fulfils his promise to Allah to assist His religion, Allah will grant him a great reward, which is Paradise."
"The Arabs of the desert who had stayed behind will now say to you: ""We were occupied with our flocks and herds and families, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Tell them: ""Who can prevail with God for you if He wish you harm or benefit? Surely God is well aware of what you do.",10,48,سَيَقُولُ لَكَ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ مِنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ شَغَلَتْنَآ أَمْوَٰلُنَا وَأَهْلُونَا فَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا يَقُولُونَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ قُلْ فَمَن يَمْلِكُ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا إِنْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ ضَرًّا أَوْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ نَفْعًۢا بَلْ كَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًۢا,"Those desert Arabs whom Allah had kept behind from accompanying you, O Messenger, on your journey to His House will say to you when you reproach them: ‘Taking care of our wealth and looking after our children kept us busy from going out with you. So ask for forgiveness from Allah on our behalf for our sins.’ They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts by asking the Prophet (peace be upon him) to seek forgiveness for them; because they have not repented from their sins. Say to them: No one can do anything for you against Allah, if He intends good for you, or if He intends bad for you. Rather, Allah is well aware of what you do. Nothing of your actions is hidden from Him no matter how much you try to conceal it."
"In fact you imagined that the Prophet and the faithful would never come back home; and this seemed pleasing to your hearts, and you entertained evil thoughts. You are a people lost.",11,48,بَلْ ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَنقَلِبَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِيهِمْ أَبَدًا وَزُيِّنَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَظَنَنتُمْ ظَنَّ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَكُنتُمْ قَوْمًۢا بُورًا,"The excuse of being preoccupied with taking care of your wealth and children as presented by you was not the reason for remaining behind going out with him. Rather, you thought that the Messenger and his companions will all die and they won't return to their families in Madina. Satan also made this seem fine in your hearts and you had an evil thought about your Lord that He will not help His prophet. You were a ruined people because of the evil thought that you had about Allah and because of your remaining behind His messenger."
"He who does not believe in God and His Apostle (should know) We have prepared for unbelievers a blazing fire.""",12,48,وَمَن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ فَإِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ سَعِيرًا,The person who does not have faith in Allah and His Messenger is a disbeliever. I have prepared on the Day of Resurrection for those who deny Allah a blazing fire by which they will be punished.
"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He may forgive whosoever He please, and afflict whosoever He will. Yet God is forgiving and kind.",13,48,وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا,To Allah alone belongs the control of the heavens and the control of the earth. He forgives the sins of those of His servants whom He wills and enters them into Paradise through His grace. He punishes those of His servants whom He wills out of His justice. Allah forgives the sins of those of His servants who repent to Him and He is merciful towards them.
"Those who had stayed behind will say: ""When you depart for taking the spoils, allow us to follow you."" They wish to change the word of God. Tell them: ""You will not follow us. That is what God has already said before."" They will say: ""You are envious of our gain."" The fact is they understand but little.",14,48,سَيَقُولُ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ إِذَا ٱنطَلَقْتُمْ إِلَىٰ مَغَانِمَ لِتَأْخُذُوهَا ذَرُونَا نَتَّبِعْكُمْ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يُبَدِّلُوا۟ كَلَٰمَ ٱللَّهِ قُل لَّن تَتَّبِعُونَا كَذَٰلِكُمْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ فَسَيَقُولُونَ بَلْ تَحْسُدُونَنَا بَلْ كَانُوا۟ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"Those whom Allah had kept behind - when you, O believers, set off to take the spoils of Khaybar which Allah had promised you after the Treaty of Hudaibiyya, will say: ‘Let us go out with you to get some of it.’ These people who were left behind want to change, by this request of theirs, Allah’s promise that He made to the believers after the Treaty of Hudaibiyya to give them alone the spoils of Khaybar. Say to them, O Messenger: You will never follow us to those spoils, because Allah has promised us that the spoils of Khaybar are only for those who were present at Hudaibiyya. They will say: Your preventing us from following you to Khaybar is not an instruction from Allah, but because you are jealous of us. The matter is not as these people who were left behind claim. Rather, they do not understand Allah’s instructions and prohibitions except a little, and therefore they have fallen into going against Him."
"Say to the desert Arabs who had stayed behind: ""You will be called against a formidable people. You will fight them till they surrender. If you obey, then He will give you a good reward; but if you turn back, as you had done before, He will punish you with a grievous affliction.""",15,48,قُل لِّلْمُخَلَّفِينَ مِنَ ٱلْأَعْرَابِ سَتُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ أُو۟لِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ تُقَٰتِلُونَهُمْ أَوْ يُسْلِمُونَ فَإِن تُطِيعُوا۟ يُؤْتِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَجْرًا حَسَنًا وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْا۟ كَمَا تَوَلَّيْتُم مِّن قَبْلُ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"O Messenger! Say to those bedouins who failed to travel to Makkah with you, testing them: “You will soon be called to fighting against a strong, courageous group of people whom you shall either have to fight in the path of Allah, or they may enter into Islam without a fight. If you obey Allah in Him inviting you to fight them, He will give you a good reward, i.e. Paradise, but if you turn away from His obedience, just like you turned away from travelling with the Messenger to Makkah, He will inflict a painful punishment on you.”"
"It is not binding on the blind, the lame or the sick (to follow this command); but those who obey God and His Apostle will be admitted by God to gardens with running streams; but those who turn back will suffer a painful doom.",16,48,لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلْأَعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى ٱلْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ يُعَذِّبْهُ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"There is no sin on a person excused due to blindness, disability or illness if he fails to fight in the path of Allah. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will enter him into gardens under the trees and palaces of which rivers flow; whilst whoever turns away from their obedience, Allah will inflict a painful punishment on him."
"God was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, for He knew well what was in their hearts, and sent down tranquility on them, and rewarded them with an expeditious victory",17,48,لَّقَدْ رَضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ ٱلسَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَٰبَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا,"Verily, Allah was pleased with the believers when they were giving their oaths to you at Ḥudaybīyyah i.e. Bay‘at Al-Riḍwān under the tree. Allah knew of the faith, sincerity and honesty in their hearts and sent down tranquility on their hearts. And He rewarded them for it with a victory in the near future i.e. the victory over Khaybar, as consolation for them missing out on being able to enter Makkah."
And the many spoils that they were to take. God is all-mighty and all-wise.,18,48,وَمَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً يَأْخُذُونَهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,"And He also granted them with many spoils that they took from the people of Khaybar. Allah is the Almighty whom no one can overcome; the Wise in His creation, decree and management."
"God had promised you many spoils that you would capture; so He gave this soon enough to you, and stayed the hands of men from you that it may serve as a sign for believers, and guide you on the straight path;",19,48,وَعَدَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً تَأْخُذُونَهَا فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَٰذِهِۦ وَكَفَّ أَيْدِىَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنكُمْ وَلِتَكُونَ ءَايَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ صِرَٰطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا,"O believers! Allah promises you of acquiring many spoils in future Islamic victories, but He has given you the spoils of Khaybar in advance and stopped the hands of the Jews when they intended to capture your families after you. And He has done this so that these advanced spoils become a sign for you of the help of Allah and His support for you. And Allah guides you to a straight path in which there is no deviance."
"And other (benefits) which you have not yet obtained, are within the compass of God, for God has power over everything.",20,48,وَأُخْرَىٰ لَمْ تَقْدِرُوا۟ عَلَيْهَا قَدْ أَحَاطَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرًا,And Allah promises you with spoils you have not yet been able to attain. Allah alone is capable of letting you acquire them; they are part of the plans and knowledge of Allah. Allah is capable of everything; nothing is outside His ability.
Had the unbelievers fought you they would have turned their backs and not found a protector or helper.,21,48,وَلَوْ قَٰتَلَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوَلَّوُا۟ ٱلْأَدْبَٰرَ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُونَ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا,"O believers! If those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger were to fight you, they would turn their backs, defeated and fleeing. They would not find any guardian who would take care of their matter, nor any helper who would help them in fighting against you."
"This is the law of God, effective as before: You will not find any change in the law of God.",22,48,سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًا,The believers being victorious and consequent defeat of the disbelievers is established in every place and era; it is a divine custom of Allah prevalent in the nations that have passed before these rejectors. O Messenger! You will not find any change in the divine custom of Allah.
"It was He who restrained their hands from you in the heart of Makkah, and your hands from them, after He had given you victory over them, as God sees all that you do.",23,48,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرًا,"He is the one who prevented the hands of the idolaters from getting to you when approximately seventy men came at Ḥudaybīyyah, intending to cause you harm. He stopped you from them; you did not kill them or cause them any harm. Rather, you freed them after Allah made it possible for you to capture them. And Allah is watchful over your actions; none of your actions are hidden from Him."
"It were those who disbelieved who hindered you from (going to) the Holy Mosque, preventing your offerings from arriving at the place of sacrifice. Had it not been for (the presence of) believers, men and women, (among the unbelievers) of whom you were unaware, and whom you might have trampled and thus incurred guilt unknowingly on account of them, (the matter would have been settled). (But this was not done) so that God may admit into His favour whom He willed. If these (believers) had been separated from them, He would have inflicted a grievous punishment on the unbelievers.",24,48,هُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱلْهَدْىَ مَعْكُوفًا أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُۥ وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَآءٌ مُّؤْمِنَٰتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَـُٔوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكُم مِّنْهُم مَّعَرَّةٌۢ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ ٱللَّهُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا۟ لَعَذَّبْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"They are the ones who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and stopped you and the sacrificial animals from Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarām. The animals remained barred from reaching the Ḥaram where they were to be sacrificed. Had it not been for a few believing men whom you did not know were believers, and by killing the disbelievers you could have killed them also, and incurred sin and had to pay blood money unknowingly, Allah would have allowed you to liberate Makkah so that He may enter into His mercy whoever He wished i.e. the believers in Makkah. If the disbelievers were distinguished from the believers in Makkah, Allah would have definitely punished those who disbelieved in Him and His Messenger with a painful punishment."
"When the unbelievers fostered a sense of honour in their hearts, a sense of pagan honour, God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the believers, and obliged them to an act of self-restraint, for they were deserving and worthy of it. God is cognisant of everything.",25,48,إِذْ جَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْحَمِيَّةَ حَمِيَّةَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ فَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُۥ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَلْزَمَهُمْ كَلِمَةَ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَكَانُوٓا۟ أَحَقَّ بِهَا وَأَهْلَهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا,"Remember when those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger harboured in their hearts the pride of ignorance; an ignorance that was linked to desires and not the truth. They haughtily rejected the entrance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) into Makkah the year of the treaty of Ḥudaybīyyah, fearing and blaming him that he would overpower them and take control over it. Therefore, Allah sent down tranquility from Himself upon the His Messenger and upon the believers so their anger did not lead to them confronting the idolaters with the same actions. Allah made the believers firm upon the statement of truth, i.e. ‘There is none worthy of worship except for Allah’, and kept them firm upon fulfilling its rights which they fulfilled. The believers were more worthy of this statement than others, and more deserving of it because of the goodness within their hearts that Allah knew of. And Allah is aware of everything; nothing is hidden from Him."
"God has truly made the vision of His Apostle come true: You will surely enter the Holy Mosque in security if God please, without any fear, having shaved your heads and cut your hair. He knew what you did not know, and has vouchsafed you, apart from this, a victory near at hand.",26,48,لَّقَدْ صَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولَهُ ٱلرُّءْيَا بِٱلْحَقِّ لَتَدْخُلُنَّ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ ٱلْحَرَامَ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ ءَامِنِينَ مُحَلِّقِينَ رُءُوسَكُمْ وَمُقَصِّرِينَ لَا تَخَافُونَ فَعَلِمَ مَا لَمْ تَعْلَمُوا۟ فَجَعَلَ مِن دُونِ ذَٰلِكَ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا,"Verily, Allah truly made the dream of His Messenger a reality; He showed it to him in his sleep and he them informed his companions of it. The dream was that he and his companions were entering the sacred house of Allah in safety from their enemies, with some of them having shaved their heads and some having only trimmed their hair, indicating the completion of their acts of pilgrimage. O believers! Allah knows some advantages that you did not know of, and so instead of making the dream a reality by letting you enter Makkah that year, He will give you a victory in the near future i.e. the signing of the treaty of Ḥudaybīyyah and the conquest of Khaybar that followed it at the hands of the believers who had witnessed Ḥudaybīyyah."
"It is He who has sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true faith, so that He may exalt it over every other creed. God is sufficient as a witness.",27,48,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُۥ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِۦ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًا,"Allah is the one who sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) with a clear message and a true religion: the religion of Islam, so that He may make it prevail over all its opposing religions. Allah has testified to that, and He is sufficient as a witness."
"Muhammad is the Prophet of God; and those who are with him are severe with infidels but compassionate among themselves. You may see them kneeling and bowing in reverence, seeking His favour and acceptance. Their mark is on their foreheads from the effect of prostrations. Their likeness in the Torah, and their likeness in the Gospel, is like a seed that sends out a stalk, then makes it firm, and it becomes strong and rises straight upon its stem, gladdening the cultivator's heart, in order to fill the unbelievers with dismay. God has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward.",28,48,مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥٓ أَشِدَّآءُ عَلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَآءُ بَيْنَهُمْ تَرَىٰهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَٰنًا سِيمَاهُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ ٱلسُّجُودِ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِى ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِى ٱلْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْـَٔهُۥ فَـَٔازَرَهُۥ فَٱسْتَغْلَظَ فَٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِۦ يُعْجِبُ ٱلزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًۢا,"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and his companions are strict against the combatant disbelievers and merciful, affectionate and friendly among themselves. O onlooker! You will see them bowing and prostrating, seeking from Allah that He grace them with forgiveness, a generous reward and that He becomes pleased with them. Their mark is on their faces as a result of prostrating in obedience to Allah. That is how they have been described by the Torah: the book that was revealed to Moses (peace be upon him). As for their mention in the Gospel which was revealed to Jesus, it is that they are likened in their assisting one another and perfection like crops that have emerged as small, then strengthened and stood straight up, pleasing the farmers with their strength and perfection. It is so that the disbelievers are angered by the strength, steadfastness and perfection they see within them. And Allah has promised those of the companions who have faith in Him and do good deeds forgiveness for their sins - they will not be taken to account over them, and a great reward from Himself i.e. Paradise."
"O YOU WHO believe, do not forestall the judgements of God and His Apostle, and have fear of God. Verily God hears all and knows everything.",0,49,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُقَدِّمُوا۟ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and follow whatever He legislates! Do not precede Allah or His Messenger in speech or action, and be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited. Indeed, Allah is hearing of your statements, aware of your actions. He does not miss any of them and will soon requite you for them."
"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him as you do with one another lest your deeds are nullified unconsciously.",1,49,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَرْفَعُوٓا۟ أَصْوَٰتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ ٱلنَّبِىِّ وَلَا تَجْهَرُوا۟ لَهُۥ بِٱلْقَوْلِ كَجَهْرِ بَعْضِكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ أَن تَحْبَطَ أَعْمَٰلُكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and follow whatever He legislates! Show good manners with His Messenger: do not raise your voices in his presence nor speak loudly to him out of respect for him, like you raise your voices to each other whilst talking to them. It is feared that the rewards of your deeds are nullified if you do so, whilst you do not realise they have been nullified."
"They who speak in a low voice in the presence of God's Apostle, have had their hearts tried by God for reverence. There is forgiveness for them and a great reward.",2,49,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَغُضُّونَ أَصْوَٰتَهُمْ عِندَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱمْتَحَنَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Indeed, those who lower their voices near the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), they are the ones whose hearts Allah has examined for His consciousness, and chosen them for it. For them is forgiveness for their sins; they will not be accounted for them, and they will receive a great reward on the Day of Judgement, which will be that Allah enters them into Paradise."
Many of those who call you from outside the apartments are not considerate.,3,49,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنَادُونَكَ مِن وَرَآءِ ٱلْحُجُرَٰتِ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ,"O Messenger! Indeed, those bedouins who call out to you from behind the dwellings of your wives, the majority of them do not understand, so do not worry about them, because if they were understanding, they would surely show good manners to you and would definitely wait until you came out to them. Then, when you came out to them, they would speak to you about their matters by lowering their voices. However, most of them have not yet understood this."
If they had waited for you to come out it would have been better for them. But God is forgiving and kind.,4,49,وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ صَبَرُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O Messenger! If these people who call out to you from behind the dwellings of your wives were to have waited and not called out to you until you came out to them, then talked to you in lowered voices, it would have been better for them than calling out to you from behind the dwellings, because it would have been more dignified and respectful. And Allah Forgiving of the sins of those of them who repent, and others. He Forgiving of them due to their ignorance, and is merciful to them."
"O you who believe, if a dissolute person brings some news, verify it first lest you attack a people ignorantly and later regret what you had done.",5,49,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن جَآءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌۢ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوٓا۟ أَن تُصِيبُوا۟ قَوْمًۢا بِجَهَٰلَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَٰدِمِينَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon whatever He legislates! If a wrongdoer brings some news about a group of people to you, then verify the truth of that news and do not hasten towards accepting it, in fear that if you accept it without verifying it, you could harm a group of people ignorantly. Then after having harmed them, you will regret it when the falsehood of the news becomes clear to you."
"Know that the Apostle of God is among you: If he agreed with you in most matters you would surely come to grief. But God has made faith more desirable to you, and attractive to your hearts, and rendered disbelief and sin and disobedience repugnant. They are those who are well directed",6,49,وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِى كَثِيرٍ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْإِيمَٰنَ وَزَيَّنَهُۥ فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ وَٱلْفُسُوقَ وَٱلْعِصْيَانَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلرَّٰشِدُونَ,"O believers! Know that amongst you is the Messenger of Allah upon whom revelation descends, so beware of lying in case he receives revelation informing him of your lying. He is better aware of your needs; if he was to obey you in many of the things you suggest, you would surely fall into difficulty which he would not want for you. However, Allah has, through His grace, made faith beloved to you and has beautified it for your hearts and so you accepted it, while making you hate disbelief, disobedience and sin. Those who possess these qualities are the ones who are treading the path of correctness and righteousness."
By God's benevolence and His grace. God is all-knowing and all-wise.,7,49,فَضْلًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَنِعْمَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,The beautification of goodness and hating of evil that you have achieved is only through the grace of Allah which He bestowed upon you and favoured you with. And Allah is aware of those of His servants who are grateful to Him and so He gives them the ability; He is Wise in that He places each thing in its appropriate place.
"If two groups of believers come to fight one another, promote peace between them. Then if one of them turns aggressive against the other, fight against the aggressive party till it returns to God's authority. If it does so, make peace among them equitably and be impartial. Verily God loves those who are just.",8,49,وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱقْتَتَلُوا۟ فَأَصْلِحُوا۟ بَيْنَهُمَا فَإِنۢ بَغَتْ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا عَلَى ٱلْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّتِى تَبْغِى حَتَّىٰ تَفِىٓءَ إِلَىٰٓ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن فَآءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُوا۟ بَيْنَهُمَا بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,"O believers! If two groups of believers quarrel with one another, then reconcile between them by inviting them to let the law of Allah be the judgement between them. Then, if one of the two reject the reconciliation and transgresses, fight the transgressing group until it returns to accepting the command of Allah. If it returns, reconcile between the two groups with fairness and justice. And be fair in your judgement between them, indeed, Allah loves those who are fair in their judgement."
"The faithful are surely brothers; so restore friendship among your brothers, and fear God that you may be favoured.",9,49,إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا۟ بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"The believers are brothers in Islam, and brotherhood in Islam demands that you, O believers, reconcile between your quarrelling brothers. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited; in the hope that you will be shown mercy."
"O you who believe, men should not laugh at other men, for it may be they are better than them; and women should not laugh at other women, for they may perhaps be better than them. Do not slander one another, nor give one another nick-names. After believing, it is bad to give (another) a bad name. Those who do not repent behave wickedly.",10,49,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا يَسْخَرْ قَوْمٌ مِّن قَوْمٍ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونُوا۟ خَيْرًا مِّنْهُمْ وَلَا نِسَآءٌ مِّن نِّسَآءٍ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَكُنَّ خَيْرًا مِّنْهُنَّ وَلَا تَلْمِزُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَلَا تَنَابَزُوا۟ بِٱلْأَلْقَٰبِ بِئْسَ ٱلِٱسْمُ ٱلْفُسُوقُ بَعْدَ ٱلْإِيمَٰنِ وَمَن لَّمْ يَتُبْ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what He has legislated! A group of you should not mock another; perhaps those that have been mocked are better according to Allah. True consideration is only for what Allah considers. And a group of women should not mock another group of women; perhaps the group mocked at is better according to Allah. Do not taunt the souls of your brothers, because they are like your own souls, and do not call others with names they do not like - as was the case of a few of the Anṣār before the arrival of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Whoever does that is a wrongdoer, and deviance is a very bad trait after having brought faith. Whoever does not repent from these sins are oppressing themselves by placing themselves in situations of destruction due to the sins they commit."
"O you who believe, avoid most suspicions: Some suspicions are indeed sins. So do not pry into others' secrets and do not backbite. Would any of you like to eat a dead brother's flesh? You would surely be revolted by it Then fear God. He is certainly forgiving and kind.",11,49,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ ٱلظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا۟ وَلَا يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضًا أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what He has legislated! Stay away from most suspicions which are not based on causes and indications that give them credence, because some suspicions are sinful, like suspecting one who is apparently pious. And do not persue the faults of believers behind their backs, nor mention another in a manner he dislikes, because mentioning him in a manner he dislikes is like eating his flesh whilst he is dead. Do any of you wish to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Therefore, abhor backbiting him because it is like that. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refrain from that which He has prohibited. Indeed, Allah Forgiving of those of His servants who repent; merciful to them."
"O men, We created you from a male and female, and formed you into nations and tribes that you may recognise each other. He who has more integrity has indeed greater honour with God. Surely God is all-knowing and well-informed.",12,49,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَٰكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوٓا۟ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ,"O people! Indeed, I have created you from one male: your father Adam, and one female: your mother Eve. Therefore, your lineage is the same, so some of you should not take pride in lineage over others. Then, I made you into many nations and dispersed tribes, so that you may recognise one another; not so that you take pride in them, because pride can only be due to Allah-consciousness; Indeed, the most noble from among you according to Allah is the one who is most mindful of Him. Indeed, Allah is aware of your conditions, knowing of what levels of perfection and deficiency you are on; nothing is hidden from him."
"The Arabs of the desert say: ""We believe."" Tell them: ""You do not believe. Better say: 'We submit'; for belief has not yet penetrated your hearts."" If you begin to obey God and His Apostle, He will not withhold the least (of the recompense) of your labour. Verily God is forgiving and kind.""",13,49,قَالَتِ ٱلْأَعْرَابُ ءَامَنَّا قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا۟ وَلَٰكِن قُولُوٓا۟ أَسْلَمْنَا وَلَمَّا يَدْخُلِ ٱلْإِيمَٰنُ فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَإِن تُطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ لَا يَلِتْكُم مِّنْ أَعْمَٰلِكُمْ شَيْـًٔا إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"When some of the bedouins came to the Prophet (peace be upon him), they said, “We have brought faith in Allah and His Messenger.” O Messenger! Say to them: “You have not brought faith, instead, say: “We have submitted and obeyed”. Faith has not yet entered your hearts; it is hoped that it does enter. O bedouins! If you obey Allah and His Messenger in faith, in doing good deeds, and in refraining from the unlawful, Allah will not decrease the reward of your deeds in the slightest. Indeed, Allah Forgiving of those of His servants who repent and is merciful to them.”"
"They alone are believers who come to believe in God and His Apostle, then never doubt again, and struggle wealth and soul in the way of God. They are the truthful and sincere.",14,49,إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَرْتَابُوا۟ وَجَٰهَدُوا۟ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّٰدِقُونَ,"The believers are only those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and then do not pollute their faith with doubts and strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and souls, not holding back on anything. Those are the ones truthful in their faith."
"Say: ""Are you trying to convince God of your faithfulness? But God knows all there is in the heavens and the earth, for God has knowledge of everything.""",15,49,قُلْ أَتُعَلِّمُونَ ٱللَّهَ بِدِينِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"O Messenger! Say to these bedouins: “Are you teaching Allah and informing Him about your religion, whilst Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on earth; He knows everything and nothing is hidden from him, so He does not need you to inform Him about your religion.”"
"They impress upon you that they have submitted. Tell them: ""Do not favour me with your submission. In fact God has favoured you by showing you the way to belief, if you are men of truth.""",16,49,يَمُنُّونَ عَلَيْكَ أَنْ أَسْلَمُوا۟ قُل لَّا تَمُنُّوا۟ عَلَىَّ إِسْلَٰمَكُم بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يَمُنُّ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْ هَدَىٰكُمْ لِلْإِيمَٰنِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"O Messenger! These bedouins recount their favour upon you by mentioning their Islam. Say to them: “Do not recount your entering the religion of Allah as a favour upon me; its benefit - if achieved - will return to you alone. Rather, it is Allah who recounts His favour upon you that He granted you the ability to enter into His religion, if indeed, you are truthful in your claim that you have entered into it.”"
Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth; and God perceives all you do.,17,49,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Indeed, Allah knows the Ghaib of the heavens and the earth; nothing is hidden from him. And Allah is watchful of your actions; none of them are hidden from Him, and He will soon requite you for the good and bad of your deeds."
QAF. I CALL to witness the glorious Qur'an.,0,50,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ قٓ وَٱلْقُرْءَانِ ٱلْمَجِيدِ,"Qāf. The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah. Allah takes an oath on the noble Qur’ān because of the meanings, abundant goodness and blessings it contains. He takes an oath on that you shall surely be resurrected on the Day of Judgement for accountability and requital."
"They are rather surprised that a warner from among themselves has come to them. So the unbelievers say: ""This is astonishing:",1,50,بَلْ عَجِبُوٓا۟ أَن جَآءَهُم مُّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَقَالَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هَٰذَا شَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ,"The cause of their rejection was not that they expected you to lie, because they know your honesty. Rather, they are amazed that a warning messenger came to them from their own species, not from the angels. They say, in amazement, “A human messenger coming to us is a strange thing!”"
"When we are dead and turned to dust, this returning (to life) is most far-fetched.""",2,50,أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا ذَٰلِكَ رَجْعٌۢ بَعِيدٌ,"“Will we be resurrected after we have died and turned into dust? Resurrection, and life returning to our bodies after they have decomposed is a far-fetched thing; it is impossible it will happen.”"
"We know what the earth consumes of them, for We have the Book that preserves everything.",3,50,قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ ٱلْأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ وَعِندَنَا كِتَٰبٌ حَفِيظٌۢ,"Verily, I know how much of their bodies the earth eats away after their death; it is not hidden from Me. I have a book that preserves everything I have decreed for them in their lives and after their deaths."
But no! They called the truth a lie when it came to them; so they are in a confused state.,4,50,بَلْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَهُمْ فِىٓ أَمْرٍ مَّرِيجٍ,"Rather, these idolaters rejected the Qur’ān when His Messenger brought it to them. They are in uncertainty regarding it; they cannot stay firm on anything regarding it."
"Have they not looked at the sky above them, how We have fashioned and adorned it, and it has no flaw?",5,50,أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَٰهَا وَزَيَّنَّٰهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ,"Do these rejectors of the resurrection not ponder over the sky above them: how I created it, made it and adorned it with the stars I placed in it, and it does not have any cracks to spoil it? The being who created this sky is not incapable of resurrecting the dead alive."
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers and We made every kind of splendid thing to grow upon it,6,50,وَٱلْأَرْضَ مَدَدْنَٰهَا وَأَلْقَيْنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ وَأَنۢبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍۭ بَهِيجٍ,"And I spread the earth in a manner fitting to live on, placing within it firm mountains so that it does not shake. I also caused all types of beautiful plants and trees to grown on it."
As instruction and reminder to every penitent creature.,7,50,تَبْصِرَةً وَذِكْرَىٰ لِكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ,I created all that as an enlightenment and reminder for every servant who turns to his Lord in obedience.
"And We send down water as a blessing from the sky, and grow gardens with it and the grain for harvest,",8,50,وَنَزَّلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً مُّبَٰرَكًا فَأَنۢبَتْنَا بِهِۦ جَنَّٰتٍ وَحَبَّ ٱلْحَصِيدِ,"And I send down rainwater from the sky, which contains abundant benefits and goodness. With that water, I then cause gardens to grow and the crops you harvest, i.e. barley etc."
And tall date-palms with their spathes pile on pile,9,50,وَٱلنَّخْلَ بَاسِقَٰتٍ لَّهَا طَلْعٌ نَّضِيدٌ,"I also cause tall date palms to grow, which have closely arranged minute flowers, one above the other."
"As a provision for men, and enlivened a region that was dead. Even thus will be the life after death.",10,50,رِّزْقًا لِّلْعِبَادِ وَأَحْيَيْنَا بِهِۦ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتًا كَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْخُرُوجُ,"I cause all that to grow, as provision for the servants so that they can eat from it. I also revive through the rainwater barren lands which have no growth, and just as I revive the barren earth I will also revive the dead who will emerge alive."
"The people of Noah, Ar-Rass and Thamud denied before you,",11,50,كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَأَصْحَٰبُ ٱلرَّسِّ وَثَمُودُ,"O Messenger! Before these people who have rejected you, many nations rejected their Prophets. The people of Noah, the people of The Well and the Thamud all denied their Prophets."
"As did the people of 'Ad and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot,",12,50,وَعَادٌ وَفِرْعَوْنُ وَإِخْوَٰنُ لُوطٍ,"The Aad and people of Pharaoh, together with the people of Lot, all denied their Prophets."
And the dwellers of the Wood and people of Tubba'. Each of them denied the apostles. So My threat became a reality.,13,50,وَأَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْأَيْكَةِ وَقَوْمُ تُبَّعٍ كُلٌّ كَذَّبَ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَحَقَّ وَعِيدِ,"The people of Shu‘ayb: the people of the Thicket, also denied their Prophet. The punishment that Allah promised them was then proven."
Were We exhausted by the act of the first creation? And yet they are confused about a new creation.,14,50,أَفَعَيِينَا بِٱلْخَلْقِ ٱلْأَوَّلِ بَلْ هُمْ فِى لَبْسٍ مِّنْ خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"Am I then incapable of having created you in the first instance, that I am incapable of resurrecting you? Rather, they are in confusion about a new creation after their previous creation."
He created man and surely know what misdoubts arise in their hearts; for We are closer to him than his jugular vein.,15,50,وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ وَنَعْلَمُ مَا تُوَسْوِسُ بِهِۦ نَفْسُهُۥ وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ ٱلْوَرِيدِ,"And I have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and I am closer to him than [his] jugular vein. Verily, I created the human and I know the thoughts and desires that pass his mind. I am closer to him than the vein that is present in his neck and connected to his heart."
"When the two (angels) who keep the account, one sitting on the right, one on the left, take it down,",16,50,إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى ٱلْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ ٱلشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ,"When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left. When the two receiving angels receive his deeds: one sitting on his right, and the other seated on his left."
There is not a word he utters but an observer is ready (to make note of it).,17,50,مَّا يَلْفِظُ مِن قَوْلٍ إِلَّا لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ,"Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]. He does not utter any statement except that there is an angel anticipating whatever he says, present."
The palsy of death will surely come. This is what you wished to avert.,18,50,وَجَآءَتْ سَكْرَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ بِٱلْحَقِّ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ,And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid. The pangs of death are a reality and will come; there is no escaping from them. O negligent human! That is what you used to turn away from and delay.
And the trumpet blast will sound: It would be the Day of Doom.,19,50,وَنُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمُ ٱلْوَعِيدِ,"And the Horn will be blown. That is the Day of [carrying out] the threat. The angel appointed to blow the trumpet will blow for the second time. That is the Day of Judgement, the day of the punishment the disbelievers and sinners have been warned of."
Each soul will come with a driver and a witness.,20,50,وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ,"And every soul will come, with it a driver and a witness. Each soul will come with an angel driving it, and an angel testifying against it for its deeds."
"(And the driver will say:) ""You were oblivious of this, so we have removed the veil, and how keen is your sight today!""",21,50,لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَٰذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ,"[It will be said], “You were certainly in heedlessness of this, and I have removed from you your cover, so your sight, this Day, is sharp.” It will be said to this human who is being driven, verily, in the world you were in neglect regarding this day because of you being deceived by your desires and pleasures. So I have removed your neglect from you by the punishment and horror you see before you. Your eyesight is sharp today; you now see everything you were neglectful of!"

"""Do not argue in My presence. I had announced the promise of doom in advance.",27,50,قَالَ لَا تَخْتَصِمُوا۟ لَدَىَّ وَقَدْ قَدَّمْتُ إِلَيْكُم بِٱلْوَعِيدِ,"[Allah] will say, “Do not dispute before Me, while I had already presented to you the warning.

"There is no changing of My word, nor am I unjust to My creatures.""",28,50,مَا يُبَدَّلُ ٱلْقَوْلُ لَدَىَّ وَمَآ أَنَا۠ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,"The word will not be changed with Me, and never will I be unjust to the servants.” The statement cannot be changed with Me, and I do not turn back on My promise.

"We shall ask Hell that day: ""Are you full?"" It will answer: ""Are there still more?""",29,50,يَوْمَ نَقُولُ لِجَهَنَّمَ هَلِ ٱمْتَلَأْتِ وَتَقُولُ هَلْ مِن مَّزِيدٍ,"On the Day I will say to Hell, “Have you been filled?” and it will say, “Are there some more,” On the day I will say to hell, “Are you full with all the disbelievers and sinners that have been thrown into you?” It will reply to its Lord, saying, “Is there any more?” asking for more, angry for its Lord."

How many generations have We destroyed before them who were mightier in power than they. Then they searched throughout the land to see if there was a way of escape.,35,50,وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّن قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُم بَطْشًا فَنَقَّبُوا۟ فِى ٱلْبِلَٰدِ هَلْ مِن مَّحِيصٍ,"How many nations there were which I destroyed before these denying idolaters amongst the people of Makkah.

We are cognisant of what they say; but it is not for you to compel them. So keep on reminding through the Qur'an whoever fears My warning.,44,50,نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِجَبَّارٍ فَذَكِّرْ بِٱلْقُرْءَانِ مَن يَخَافُ وَعِيدِ,"I know best what these deniers say. And you are not imposed on them, O Messenger, to force them to accept faith. You are only a conveyer of what Allah has ordered you to convey, so remind through the Qur’ān he who fears my warning to the disbelievers and the sinful, because the fearful is the one who takes advice and takes reminders when reminded."

We are messengers from Allah”. And they informed him of what will please him, i.e., that he will have a son who will have a lot of knowledge. The one regarding whom glad tidings were given was Isaac (peace be upon him)."
"His wife came out lamenting, striking her forehead, and said: ""I, am old and barren woman?""",28,51,فَأَقْبَلَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُهُۥ فِى صَرَّةٍ فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا وَقَالَتْ عَجُوزٌ عَقِيمٌ,"When his wife heard the glad tiding, she came screaming out of happiness and slapped her face, and said in surprise: “Will an old woman give birth when she is actually barren?”"
"They said: ""Thus said your Lord. He is indeed all-wise and all-knowing.""",29,51,قَالُوا۟ كَذَٰلِكِ قَالَ رَبُّكِ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"The angels said to her: “What we have informed you of is what your Lord has said. And there is nobody to refute what he said. It is He who is Wise in His creating and decreeing, Knowing of His creation and what is in their interests”."
"He said: ""What is then your business, O messengers?""",30,51,قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكُمْ أَيُّهَا ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,Abraham (peace be upon him) said to the angels: “What is you case? And what do you intend?”
"They said: ""We have been sent to a wicked people",31,51,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّآ أُرْسِلْنَآ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ مُّجْرِمِينَ,The angels said in reply: “Allah has sent us to a criminal people who commit despicable sins.
So as to let loose clods of clay on them,32,51,لِنُرْسِلَ عَلَيْهِمْ حِجَارَةً مِّن طِينٍ,So that I can send upon them stones of hard clay.
"Marked by your Lord for those who waste their substance.""",33,51,مُّسَوَّمَةً عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"Marked in your Lord’s presence, O Abraham, and sent upon those who transgress the limits of Allah and who go to the extreme of disbelief and sins”."
"So We evacuated everyone who was a believer there,",34,51,فَأَخْرَجْنَا مَن كَانَ فِيهَا مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"So I took out whoever was in the city of the people of Lot from the believers, so that the punishment which will befall the criminals will not befall them."
But did not find more than a single family of believers.,35,51,فَمَا وَجَدْنَا فِيهَا غَيْرَ بَيْتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"But I did not find in their city besides one house of the Muslims, which was the household of Lot (peace be upon him)."
"We left a sign in this for those who fear the grievous punishment,",36,51,وَتَرَكْنَا فِيهَآ ءَايَةً لِّلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلْأَلِيمَ,"And I left in the city of Lot signs of punishment which will show that punishment befell them, so that those who fear the painful punishment which afflicted them take lessons from it and then not do what they did"
As (there was) in Moses when We sent him to the Pharaoh with clear authority.,37,51,وَفِى مُوسَىٰٓ إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَٰهُ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"And in Moses, when I sent him to Pharaoh with clear miracles and proof, is a sign for the one who fears the painful punishment."
"But he turned to his counsellors, and said: ""He is a magician or lunatic.""",38,51,فَتَوَلَّىٰ بِرُكْنِهِۦ وَقَالَ سَٰحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ,"But Pharaoh turned away from the truth, and he said regarding Moses (peace be upon him): “He is a magician that does magic on people or a madman who says what he does not understand”."
"So We seized him and his armies, and threw them into the sea, for he was worthy of blame.",39,51,فَأَخَذْنَٰهُ وَجُنُودَهُۥ فَنَبَذْنَٰهُمْ فِى ٱلْيَمِّ وَهُوَ مُلِيمٌ,"So I seized him and all of his armies, then threw them in the sea, so they were drowned and destroyed. And Pharaoh will be held accountable for his blameworthy actions- denial of the message and his claim of divinity."
"In 'Ad (also is a sign), when We sent a blasting wind against them,",40,51,وَفِى عَادٍ إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلرِّيحَ ٱلْعَقِيمَ,"And in Ad, the people of Hud, is a sign for one who fears the painful punishment, when I sent upon them the wind which does not carry rain or pollinate trees, nor were there any blessings in it."
Which turned everything it touched to ashes.,41,51,مَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِلَّا جَعَلَتْهُ كَٱلرَّمِيمِ,"It did not leave any soul, wealth or anything else it came upon, except that it destroyed it and left it like scattered ruins."
"And in Thamud, when We said to them: ""Enjoy yourselves for a while;""",42,51,وَفِى ثَمُودَ إِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَمَتَّعُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,"And in Thamud, the people of Salih (peace be upon him), is a sign for the one who fears the painful punishment, when it was said to them: “Enjoy yourselves before your life comes to an end”."
"But they disobeyed the command of their Lord; so they were destroyed by a thunderbolt, and they could only gape,",43,51,فَعَتَوْا۟ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ وَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ,"But they were arrogant to the command of their Lord and they were haughty to faith and obedience, so the thunderbolt of punishment seized them whilst they were waiting it to come down, as they were promised punishment three days before it came."
And neither stand up nor defend themselves.,44,51,فَمَا ٱسْتَطَٰعُوا۟ مِن قِيَامٍ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُنتَصِرِينَ,So they were unable to repel the punishment that befell them nor did they have any power to defend themselves with.
(So had We destroyed) the people of Noah before them: They were surely a sinful people.,45,51,وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ قَوْمًا فَٰسِقِينَ,"And I destroyed the people of Noah through flooding before these who have been mentioned. They were a people who left the obedience of Allah, so they deserved His punishment."
We built the heavens by Our authority; and We are the Lord of power and expanse.,46,51,وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَٰهَا بِأَيْي۟دٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ,"And the sky I made and perfected its making with strength, and I am expanding its edges and expanding for My servants by increasing provision."
We spread the earth a carpet; what comfort We provide!,47,51,وَٱلْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَٰهَا فَنِعْمَ ٱلْمَٰهِدُونَ,"And the earth I made prepared for those who live on it, like a spread for them. How excellent a preparer I am when I prepared it for them."
And We created pairs of everything that you may contemplate.,48,51,وَمِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَا زَوْجَيْنِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"And of everything I have created two types, like the male and female, sky and earth, and the land and sea, so that you remember the oneness of Allah who created two types of everything and you remember His power."
So turn to God. I give you a clear warning from Him.,49,51,فَفِرُّوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنِّى لَكُم مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"So flee from Allah’s punishment towards His reward, by obeying Him and not disobeying Him. I am a clear warner to you, O people, of His punishment."
Do not set up another god with God. I give you a clear warning from Him.,50,51,وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا۟ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا ءَاخَرَ إِنِّى لَكُم مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And do not make alongside Allah another deity to worship besides Him. I am a clear warner to you.
"Even thus no apostle came to those before them but they said: ""He is a sorcerer or a mad man.""",51,51,كَذَٰلِكَ مَآ أَتَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا قَالُوا۟ سَاحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ,"Like the denial of the people of Makkah, the previous nations denied. No Messenger came to them from Allah except that they said regarding him: “He is a magician or a madman”."
"Is this the legacy they have passed down from one to the other? In fact, they are a rebellious people.",52,51,أَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِهِۦ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَاغُونَ,"Did the predecessors amongst the disbelievers and the latter amongst them bequest one another to deny the messengers? No, but rather their transgression has united them on this."
Turn away from them. You will not be blamed.,53,51,فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَنتَ بِمَلُومٍ,"So turn away from these deniers, O Messenger, for you are not blameworthy, as you have conveyed to them what you were sent with towards them."
"But go on reminding them, as reminding benefits the believers.",54,51,وَذَكِّرْ فَإِنَّ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ تَنفَعُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"And do not let their turning away from you stop you from advising them and reminding them, so advise and remind them, as reminding is beneficial for those who bring faith in Allah."
I have not created the jinns and men but to worship Me.,55,51,وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ,And I did not create jinns and men except for My worship alone. I did not create them to make a partner for Me.
I want no sustenance from them nor do I want them to feed Me.,56,51,مَآ أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ,I do not want any provision off them nor do I want them to feed Me.
"God is certainly the great provider, Lord of strength and power.",57,51,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلرَّزَّاقُ ذُو ٱلْقُوَّةِ ٱلْمَتِينُ,"Allah is the Provider for His servants, all of them are in need of His provision, He is the Supreme-Lord, Every Mighty, nothing is outside His ability. All of the jinns and men submit to His power (may He be glorified)."
Those who do wrong will indeed come to the same end as their fellows (of old). So let them not ask Me to hasten (the punishment).,58,51,فَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ ذَنُوبًا مِّثْلَ ذَنُوبِ أَصْحَٰبِهِمْ فَلَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونِ,"Those who wronged themselves by denying you, O Messenger, have a share of the punishment, like the share of their companions before them, which has a fixed time period. So they should not ask Me to bring it quicker before its time."
Alas the woe for those who refuse to believe in the Day which has been promised them.,59,51,فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن يَوْمِهِمُ ٱلَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ,"So destruction and loss is for those who disbelieved in Allah and who denied His messengers, on their day, the Day of Judgment, in which they are being promised that the punishment will be sent upon them."
"I CALL TO witness the Mount Sinai,",0,52,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلطُّورِ,Allah swore by the mountain on which He spoke to Moses (peace be upon him).
And the Scripture inscribed,1,52,وَكِتَٰبٍ مَّسْطُورٍ,And he swore by the Qur’ān which is a written book
"On a parchment scroll unrolled,",2,52,فِى رَقٍّ مَّنشُورٍ,On a spread-open paper.
"The house ever-peopled,",3,52,وَٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْمَعْمُورِ,And He swore by the House in the heavens which the angels in the heavens inhabit by worshipping Allah.
"The roof raised high,",4,52,وَٱلسَّقْفِ ٱلْمَرْفُوعِ,And He swore by the sky.
"And the swollen sea,",5,52,وَٱلْبَحْرِ ٱلْمَسْجُورِ,And He swore by the sea filled with water.
The punishment of your Lord is certain to come.,6,52,إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَٰقِعٌ,"O Messenger, the punishment of your Lord will definitely occur on the disbelievers."
There is none who could avert it.,7,52,مَّا لَهُۥ مِن دَافِعٍ,There is nobody to repel it from them and save them from it befalling them.
"The day the sky will tremble,",8,52,يَوْمَ تَمُورُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ مَوْرًا,"The day in which the heavens (or sky) will move violently, in full accordance with the arrival of the Hour."
"The mountains move and fly away,",9,52,وَتَسِيرُ ٱلْجِبَالُ سَيْرًا,And the mountains will travel from their places.
Will be the day of woe for those,10,52,فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,So destruction and loss on that day will be for those who deny the punishment Allah promised the disbelievers.
"Who, ignoring the Reality, engage in pleasantries.",11,52,ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ,"Those who are in their discourse in falsehood, playing. They do not care about resurrection or being raised."
"The day they are dragged and pushed into Hell,",12,52,يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَىٰ نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا,The day they will be pushed with force and harshness towards the fire of hell.
"(And told:) ""This is the fire which you denied.",13,52,هَٰذِهِ ٱلنَّارُ ٱلَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,"And it will be said to them in rebuke, “This is the fire you used to deny when your messengers used to warn you of it."
"Is it magic, or you cannot see?",14,52,أَفَسِحْرٌ هَٰذَآ أَمْ أَنتُمْ لَا تُبْصِرُونَ,"Is this punishment which you see magic, or are you not seeing it?"
"Roast in it. Bear it with patience or impatience, it will be the same for you. You will be requited for what you had done.""",15,52,ٱصْلَوْهَا فَٱصْبِرُوٓا۟ أَوْ لَا تَصْبِرُوا۟ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,Taste the heat of this fire and suffer it. Be patient over suffering its heat or not; your patience or impatience is all the same. You will not be rewarded today except with the disbelief and sins you used to commit in the world”.
"Those who fear God and follow the straight path will surely be in gardens and in bliss,",16,52,إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّٰتٍ وَنَعِيمٍ,Those who are mindful of their Lord by carrying out His commands and refraining from His prohibitions will be in gardens and a great pleasure which will never end.
Rejoicing at what their Lord has given them; and their Lord will preserve them from the torment of Hell.,17,52,فَٰكِهِينَ بِمَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ وَوَقَىٰهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"They will be enjoying the pleasures of food, drink and marriage that Allah will have given them, and their Lord (may He be glorified), protected them from the punishment of hell. Hence, they were successful through achieving their desired pleasures and by being protected from difficulties."
"""Eat and drink with relish,"" (they will be told), (as recompense) for what you had done.""",18,52,كُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ هَنِيٓـًٔۢا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"It will be said to them: “Eat and drink of what your souls desire, in satisfaction without fearing harm or pain from what you eat and drink, as a reward for your excellent actions in the world”."
"They would recline on couches set in rows, paired with fair companions (clean of thought and) bright of eye.",19,52,مُتَّكِـِٔينَ عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مَّصْفُوفَةٍ وَزَوَّجْنَٰهُم بِحُورٍ عِينٍ,"Reclining on adorned thrones which have been lined up, and I will marry them to fair women with beautiful wide eyes."
"And those who believed, and whose progeny also followed them in their faith, will be united with their offspring. We will not deprive them of their labour in the least. Every man is bound to what he does.",20,52,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَٰنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَٰهُم مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ كُلُّ ٱمْرِئٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهِينٌ,"And those who brought faith and whose children followed them in faith - I will join their children with them so that they are pleased with them, even though they did not reach their actions. And I will not decrease anything from the reward of their actions. Every person will be held for the bad actions he earned; nobody else will bear any of his actions."
"We shall give them fruits and meats, and what they desire.",21,52,وَأَمْدَدْنَٰهُم بِفَٰكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,And I will provide these people of Paradise with different fruits and I will provide them with all the meat they desire.
They will exchange cups of wine free of (incitement to) pleasantry or sin.,22,52,يَتَنَٰزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْسًا لَّا لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلَا تَأْثِيمٌ,"They will give to one another cups of wine, bearing no resemeblness to the wine of this world, free from intoxication and that which arises from it, such as false speech."
"And young attendants like pearls within their shells, will go round.",23,52,وَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ غِلْمَانٌ لَّهُمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لُؤْلُؤٌ مَّكْنُونٌ,"And servants will circle amongst them, as though they are protected pearls."
"They will ask each other questions,",24,52,وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"The people of Paradise will turn to one another, asking each other about their condition in the world."
"Saying: ""We were also once full of fear at home.",25,52,قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُنَّا قَبْلُ فِىٓ أَهْلِنَا مُشْفِقِينَ,"They will respond to them: “We were, in the world amongst our families, fearful of Allah’s punishment."
"But God has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of scorching wind.",26,52,فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَوَقَىٰنَا عَذَابَ ٱلسَّمُومِ,"So Allah favoured us by guiding us to Islam, and He protected us from the punishment which is extremely hot."
We used to pray to Him erstwhile; He is the just and merciful.,27,52,إِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلُ نَدْعُوهُ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْبَرُّ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"We used to worship Him in our worldly life and we used to pray to Him to protect us from the fire of hell. He is Beneficent to His servants and Merciful to them. Part of His beneficence and mercy upon us is that He guided us to faith, entered us into Paradise and distanced us from the fire.”"
"Remind them, therefore, that by the grace of your Lord you are neither a soothsayer nor possessed.",28,52,فَذَكِّرْ فَمَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَتِ رَبِّكَ بِكَاهِنٍ وَلَا مَجْنُونٍ,"So remind through the Qur’ān, O Messenger, for you are not, by the faith and intelligence Allah has favoured you with, a soothsayer with visions of jinns nor are you insane."
"Do they say: ""He is a poet for whom we expect an adverse turn of fortune?""",29,52,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ شَاعِرٌ نَّتَرَبَّصُ بِهِۦ رَيْبَ ٱلْمَنُونِ,"Do these idolaters say: “Muhammad is not a messenger, but he is a poet whom we await death to seize so we can be relieved of him”?"
"Tell them: ""Keep on expecting, I am expecting with you.""",30,52,قُلْ تَرَبَّصُوا۟ فَإِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُتَرَبِّصِينَ,"O Messenger, say to them: “Await my death, and I will await the punishment which will befall you due to denying me”."
"Does their reasoning prompt them to this, or they are a people rebellious?",31,52,أَمْ تَأْمُرُهُمْ أَحْلَٰمُهُم بِهَٰذَآ أَمْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَاغُونَ,"Or do their minds tell them to say: “He is a soothsayer and insane?” So they combine what cannot gather in one person, but rather they are a people who trespass the bounds, hence they do not return to any sacred law or intellect."
"Or do they say: ""He has fabricated it?"" In fact, they will never believe.",32,52,أَمْ يَقُولُونَ تَقَوَّلَهُۥ بَل لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Or do they say: “Muhammad fabricated this Qur’ān and nothing has been revealed to him?” He has not fabricated it, but rather they are too arrogant to have faith in it, so they say: “He has fabricated it”."
"So let them bring a discourse like it, if they are truthful",33,52,فَلْيَأْتُوا۟ بِحَدِيثٍ مِّثْلِهِۦٓ إِن كَانُوا۟ صَٰدِقِينَ,"So let them produce a narrative like it, even if it has been fabricated, if they are true in their claim that he has fabricated it."
Or were they created of themselves? Or are they the creators?,34,52,أَمْ خُلِقُوا۟ مِنْ غَيْرِ شَىْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰلِقُونَ,"Or have they been created without a creator to create them? Or are they their own creators? The existence of a creation without a creator or a creation which creates itself is impossible, so why do they not worship their own creator?"
Or have they created the heavens and the earth? In fact they are certain of nothing.,35,52,أَمْ خَلَقُوا۟ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth? But they do not have conviction that Allah is their Creator, if they had been convinced of that, they would have declared His oneness and brought faith in His Messenger."
Do they possess the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the treasurers?,36,52,أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَآئِنُ رَبِّكَ أَمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُصَۣيْطِرُونَ,"Or do they have the treasures of your Lord’s provision to give to whom they wish, and prophethood to give to or stop from whom they want? Or are they the controllers and disposers according to their wish?"
Or do they have a ladder (climbing which) they can hear (the secrets of heaven)? Let one who has heard then bring a clear proof.,37,52,أَمْ لَهُمْ سُلَّمٌ يَسْتَمِعُونَ فِيهِ فَلْيَأْتِ مُسْتَمِعُهُم بِسُلْطَٰنٍ مُّبِينٍ,Or do they have a ladder with which to climb to the sky in which they listen to Allah’s revelation which He sends to tell them they are on the truth? So let the one who listens amongst them to that revelation bring a clear proof to affirm you in your claim that you are on truth.
Has (God) daughters and they sons?,38,52,أَمْ لَهُ ٱلْبَنَٰتُ وَلَكُمُ ٱلْبَنُونَ,"Or does He (may He be glorified) have daughters which you dislike, whilst you have sons which you love?"
Or do you demand any wages from them so that they are burdened with expense?,39,52,أَمْ تَسْـَٔلُهُمْ أَجْرًا فَهُم مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ,"Or do you, O Messenger, seek a wage from them for what you convey to them from their Lord, due to which they are burdened with something they cannot bear?"
Or do they have knowledge of the Unknown which they write down?,40,52,أَمْ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ,"Or do they have knowledge of the Ghaib, so that they write for people what they learn from the Ghaib and inform them of what they want therefrom?"
Or do they want to stage a deception? -- Then only those who do not believe will be the ones who will be tricked.,41,52,أَمْ يُرِيدُونَ كَيْدًا فَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ هُمُ ٱلْمَكِيدُونَ,"Or do these deniers intend to plot against you and your religion. Trust in Allah, as those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger are the ones who will be plotted against, not you."
Or do they have a god apart from God? He is too exalted for what they associate with Him!,42,52,أَمْ لَهُمْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,Or do they have a true god besides Allah? Pure and exalted is Allah from the partner they attribute to him. None of what was mentioned has happened or is even thinkable.
"If they should see a segment falling from the sky, they would say: ""It is only a massive cloud.""",43,52,وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ,"And if they see a piece of the sky falling, they will say: “This is a cloud which is piled up on each other as usual”. So they do not take heed or believe."
"So, leave them until they face their day (of doom) when they will be stunned.",44,52,فَذَرْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُلَٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ,"So leave them, O Messenger, in their stubbornness and denial until they meet their day in which they will be punished, which is the day of judgment."
"Their deception will not avail them in the least on that day, nor will they be helped.",45,52,يَوْمَ لَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"The day when their plot will neither help them a little or a lot, nor will they be helped by being saved from the punishment."
"Surely there are other torments besides this for those who are wicked, though most of them do not know.",46,52,وَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ عَذَابًا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"And for those who wronged themselves through idolatry and sins is a punishment before the punishment of the afterlife: in this life through being killed and imprisoned, and in the Transitory Stage through punishment of the grave. However, most of them do not know that, which is why they remain on their disbelief."
"Await the judgement of your Lord, for you are always before Our eyes, and glorify your Lord with praises when you rise,",47,52,وَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ,"Be patient, O Messenger, on the decree of your Lord and His divine law, as you are in My sight and protection. And glorify and praise your Lord when you stand from your sleep."
And glorify Him in the night and when the stars begin to wane.,48,52,وَمِنَ ٱلَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَإِدْبَٰرَ ٱلنُّجُومِ,"And at night, glorify your Lord and pray to Him, and pray the Fajr prayer after the stars have set due to daylight."
I CALL TO witness the star of the pleiades when it has dipped,0,53,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلنَّجْمِ إِذَا هَوَىٰ,He (may He be glorified) swore by the star when it descends.
"That your companion is not confused, nor has he gone astray,",1,53,مَا ضَلَّ صَاحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَىٰ,"Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allah did not deviate from the path of guidance nor did he go astray, but rather he is rightly-guided."
Neither does he speak of his own will.,2,53,وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰٓ,And he did not speak this Qur’ān out of following his desires.
"This is only revelation communicated,",3,53,إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْىٌ يُوحَىٰ,This Qur’ān is nothing but a revelation which Allah revealed to him through the medium of Gabriel (peace be upon him)
"Bestowed on him by the Supreme Intellect,",4,53,عَلَّمَهُۥ شَدِيدُ ٱلْقُوَىٰ,"An angel of great strength, Gabriel (peace be upon him), taught him it."
"Lord of power and wisdom. So he acquired poise and balance,",5,53,ذُو مِرَّةٍ فَٱسْتَوَىٰ,"And Gabriel (peace be upon him) is of excellent form, so he rose up appearing to the Prophet (peace be upon him) in his form in which Allah created him."
And reached the highest pinnacle.,6,53,وَهُوَ بِٱلْأُفُقِ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ,Whilst he was on the highest horizon.
Then he drew near and drew closer,7,53,ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ,"Then Gabriel (peace be upon him) came close to the Prophet (peace be upon him), then he came even closer."
"Until a space of two bow (arcs) or even less remained,",8,53,فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ,So his closeness to him was the distance of two bow lengths or even closer.
When He revealed to His votary what He revealed.,9,53,فَأَوْحَىٰٓ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِۦ مَآ أَوْحَىٰ,"So Gabriel (peace be upon him) revealed to Allah’s servant, Muhammad (peace be upon him), what he revealed."
His heart did not falsify what he perceived.,10,53,مَا كَذَبَ ٱلْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَىٰٓ,The heart of Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not lie about what his eye saw.
Will you dispute with him what he saw?,11,53,أَفَتُمَٰرُونَهُۥ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَىٰ,"So do you, O idolaters, argue with him about what he saw on the night he was taken on the journey?"
He saw Him indeed another time,12,53,وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ,And Muhammad (peace be upon him) had seen Gabriel (peace be upon him) in his true form another time on the night he was taken for the journey.
"By the Lote-tree beyond which none can pass,",13,53,عِندَ سِدْرَةِ ٱلْمُنتَهَىٰ,"By the lote tree of the utmost boundary, which is a tree on the seventh heaven."
"Close to which is the Garden of Tranquility,",14,53,عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰٓ,By this tree is the Garden of Refuge.
When the Lote-tree was covered over with what it was covered over;,15,53,إِذْ يَغْشَى ٱلسِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ,When the lote tree was covered through the command of Allah by something great whose true nature only Allah knows.
Neither did sight falter nor exceed the bounds.,16,53,مَا زَاغَ ٱلْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ,"The eye of Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not swerve left or right, nor did it trespass what was fixed for it."
Indeed he saw some of the greatest signs of His Lord.,17,53,لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ ءَايَٰتِ رَبِّهِ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰٓ,"Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw on the night he was raised great signs of his Lord which show His power. He saw Paradise, hell and other things."
"Have you considered Lat and 'Uzza,",18,53,أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ ٱللَّٰتَ وَٱلْعُزَّىٰ,"Have you, O idolaters, seen these idols that you worship besides Allah: Lat and Uzza"
"And Manat, the other third (of the pagan deities)?",19,53,وَمَنَوٰةَ ٱلثَّالِثَةَ ٱلْأُخْرَىٰٓ,"And Manat, another third one amongst your idols? Tell me do they possess any benefit or harm for him?"
"Are there sons for you, and daughters for Him?",20,53,أَلَكُمُ ٱلذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ ٱلْأُنثَىٰ,"O idolaters, do you have boys whom you like, whilst He (may He be glorified) has girls which you dislike?"
This is certainly an unjust apportioning.,21,53,تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰٓ,This distribution which you made with your desires is an unjust distribution.
"These are only names which you and your fathers have invented. No authority was sent down by God for them. They only follow conjecture and wish-fulfilment, even though guidance had come to them already from their Lord.",22,53,إِنْ هِىَ إِلَّآ أَسْمَآءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُم مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَٰنٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى ٱلْأَنفُسُ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰٓ,"These idols are nothing but names without meaning, so they have no share of divine qualities. You and your fathers named them on your own part. Allah did not reveal any proof for them. The idolaters do not follow in their belief except assumption and what their souls desire from what the satan has adorned in their hearts. And the guidance has come to them from their Lord on the tongue of Muhammad (peace be upon him), but they were not guided."
Can ever man get what he desires?,23,53,أَمْ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ مَا تَمَنَّىٰ,"Or will man have what he desired i.e., the idols interceding with Allah?"
To God belong the End and the Beginning.,24,53,فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةُ وَٱلْأُولَىٰ,"No, he will not have what he desired. For Allah alone is the afterlife and the first [life]; He grants of them whatever He wishes and withholds whatever He wishes."
Many as the angels be in heaven their intercession will not avail in the least without God's permission for whomsoever He please and approve.,25,53,وَكَم مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ لَا تُغْنِى شَفَٰعَتُهُمْ شَيْـًٔا إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ ٱللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَىٰٓ,"How many angels are there in the heavens whose intercession cannot help at all if they were to intend to help someone, except after Allah permits intercession for whom He wishes among them and He is pleased with the one being interceded for. Allah will never permit one who associates a partner with Him to intercede and He will never be pleased with the one he is interceding for who worships him besides Allah."
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels names of females.,26,53,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لَيُسَمُّونَ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ تَسْمِيَةَ ٱلْأُنثَىٰ,Those who do not believe in the resurrection in the afterlife give the angels female names in their belief that they are the daughters of Allah. Allah is far above what they say.
"Yet they have no knowledge of this, and follow nothing but conjecture, but conjecture cannot replace the truth.",27,53,وَمَا لَهُم بِهِۦ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لَا يُغْنِى مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْـًٔا,"In giving them female names they have no knowledge to base this on. They merely follow speculation. Speculation is of no value against the truth, to take its place."
So you turn away from him who turns away from Our rememberance and wants nothing but the life of this world:,28,53,فَأَعْرِضْ عَن مَّن تَوَلَّىٰ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَلَمْ يُرِدْ إِلَّا ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا,"So, O Messenger, ignore those who turn away from Allah’s remembrance without showing any concern for it, and who want only the life of this world and therefore do not work for their Hereafter because they do not believe in it."
This is the farthest limit of their knowledge. Surely your Lord alone knows best who has strayed away from the path and who has come to guidance.,29,53,ذَٰلِكَ مَبْلَغُهُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,That which the idolaters say - about giving the angels female names - is the limit of their knowledge because they are ignorant. They have not reached certainty. Your Lord - O Messenger- knows best about those who deviate from the path of truth and He knows best about those who are guided to its path. Nothing of that is hidden from Him.
"To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, that He may requite those who do evil, in accordance with their deeds, and those who do good with good.",30,53,وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسَٰٓـُٔوا۟ بِمَا عَمِلُوا۟ وَيَجْزِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ بِٱلْحُسْنَى,"To Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and to Him alone belongs whatever is on earth. He created, owns and controls all of it. To recompense whose who do evil actions in the world with the punishment that they deserve and to repay the believers who do good actions with Paradise."
"As for those who avoid the greater sins and shameful acts, except minor trespasses, your Lord's forgiveness surely has great amplitude. He is fully knowledgeable of you as He produced you from the earth, and since you were a foetus in your mother's womb. So do not assert your goodness; he is better who takes heed and preserves himself.",31,53,ٱلَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَٰٓئِرَ ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ إِلَّا ٱللَّمَمَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ وَٰسِعُ ٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِذْ أَنشَأَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِذْ أَنتُمْ أَجِنَّةٌ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ فَلَا تُزَكُّوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰٓ,"Those who stay away from major sins and evil wrongs, besides minor sins as these are forgiven by leaving out the major ones and by an abundance of good deeds. Your Lord, O Messenger, is of vast forgiveness. He forgives the sins of His servants when they repent from them. He, (may He be glorified), knew best about their states and affairs when He created their father, Adam, from earth and when you were in the wombs of your mothers, being created in one form after another. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. So do not claim purity for your souls by praising them and asserting their piety. He, (may He be glorified), knows best about those who are mindful of Him, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"Have you seen him who turns his back,",32,53,أَفَرَءَيْتَ ٱلَّذِى تَوَلَّىٰ,Have you seen the evil state of the one who turned away from Islam after coming close to it?
"Who gives but little, and is niggardly?",33,53,وَأَعْطَىٰ قَلِيلًا وَأَكْدَىٰٓ,"He gave a little wealth and then held back, because miserliness was an innate quality in him. Despite this he declares his soul to be pure."
Has he knowledge of the Unknown that he perceives everything?,34,53,أَعِندَهُۥ عِلْمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰٓ,Does he have knowledge of the Ghaib and therefore sees and speaks about the Ghaib?
"Has he not heard what is contained in the Book of Moses,",35,53,أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِى صُحُفِ مُوسَىٰ,"Or is he fabricating against Allah? Or has this person, who makes up lies about Allah, not been informed about what was in the earlier scriptures that Allah had revealed to Moses?"
And of Abraham who fulfilled his trust? --,36,53,وَإِبْرَٰهِيمَ ٱلَّذِى وَفَّىٰٓ,And the scriptures of Abraham who fulfilled everything His Lord tasked him with?
That no one who carries a burden bears another's load;,37,53,أَلَّا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ,That no person will bear the sin of another.
That a man receives but only that for which he strives;,38,53,وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ إِلَّا مَا سَعَىٰ,And that man will only obtain the reward of the action that he did.
"That his endeavours will be judged,",39,53,وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُۥ سَوْفَ يُرَىٰ,And that his action will be openly seen on the Day of Judgement.
And only then will he receive his recompense in full;,40,53,ثُمَّ يُجْزَىٰهُ ٱلْجَزَآءَ ٱلْأَوْفَىٰ,Then he will be given the recompense of his action in full without reduction.
And that to your Lord is your returning;,41,53,وَأَنَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ ٱلْمُنتَهَىٰ,"And that to your Lord, O Messenger, will be the return and destination of the servants after they die."
"That it is He who makes you happy and morose,",42,53,وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَىٰ,"And that He makes whoever He wills happy and makes him laugh, and makes whoever He wills sad and makes him cry."
And He who ordains death and life;,43,53,وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَمَاتَ وَأَحْيَا,And that He causes the living to die in the world and brings the dead to life by resurrection.
"That He created pairs, male and female,",44,53,وَأَنَّهُۥ خَلَقَ ٱلزَّوْجَيْنِ ٱلذَّكَرَ وَٱلْأُنثَىٰ,And that He created the two types: Male and female.
From a drop of semen when emitted;,45,53,مِن نُّطْفَةٍ إِذَا تُمْنَىٰ,From a drop when it is placed in the womb.
That the second creation is incumbent on Him;,46,53,وَأَنَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلنَّشْأَةَ ٱلْأُخْرَىٰ,And that He will undertake to recreate them after they die for the resurrection.
That it is He who makes you rich and contented;,47,53,وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَغْنَىٰ وَأَقْنَىٰ,And that He enriches whichever of His servants He wills by making him the owner of wealth and He gives wealth that people take as possessions they acquire.
That He is the Lord of Sirius;,48,53,وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلشِّعْرَىٰ,"And that He is the Lord of Sirius, the star that is worshipped by some idolaters together with Allah."
"That it was He who destroyed the 'Ad of old,",49,53,وَأَنَّهُۥٓ أَهْلَكَ عَادًا ٱلْأُولَىٰ,"And that He destroyed the first Ad, who were the people of Hud when they persisted in their disbelief."
"And Thamud, and did not leave them,",50,53,وَثَمُودَا۟ فَمَآ أَبْقَىٰ,"And He destroyed the Thamud, the people of Salih, and did not spare any one of them."
"Like the people of Noah before them, who were surely oppressors and rebellious;",51,53,وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا۟ هُمْ أَظْلَمَ وَأَطْغَىٰ,"He destroyed the people of Noah before the Ad and Thamud. The people of Noah were more unjust and transgressed even more than the Ad and Thamud, because Noah lived amongst them for nine hundred and fifty years inviting them to Allah’s oneness but they did not respond to him."
"And He overthrew the Cities of the Plain,",52,53,وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَىٰ,He raised the villages of the people of Lot to the sky and then dropped them to ground.
So that they were covered over by what they were covered over.,53,53,فَغَشَّىٰهَا مَا غَشَّىٰ,He then covered them with stones after raising them to the sky and dropping them to the ground.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?,54,53,فَبِأَىِّ ءَالَآءِ رَبِّكَ تَتَمَارَىٰ,"So which of the signs of your Lord indicating His power do you dispute with, O man, and not take a lesson from?"
He who warns you is one of the warners of old.,55,53,هَٰذَا نَذِيرٌ مِّنَ ٱلنُّذُرِ ٱلْأُولَىٰٓ,This messenger that is sent to you is from the class of the earlier messengers.
What is to come is imminent.,56,53,أَزِفَتِ ٱلْءَازِفَةُ,The Day of Standing has drawn nearer.
There is no one to unveil it apart from God.,57,53,لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ كَاشِفَةٌ,There is no one that can push it back and no one to uncover it besides Allah.
"Are you astonished at this news,",58,53,أَفَمِنْ هَٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ تَعْجَبُونَ,"Do you marvel at this Qur’ān that is recited to you, that it is from Allah?"
"And keep laughing and do not weep,",59,53,وَتَضْحَكُونَ وَلَا تَبْكُونَ,And laugh mockingly at it and not cry when hearing its admonitions?
Indulging in pleasantries?,60,53,وَأَنتُمْ سَٰمِدُونَ,"Whilst you are neglectful of it, not giving it any attention?"
Bow instead in adoration before God and worship Him.,61,53,فَٱسْجُدُوا۟ لِلَّهِ وَٱعْبُدُوا۟,"So prostrate to Allah alone, and dedicate your worship to Him."
THE HOUR HAS come and split is the moon.,0,54,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱقْتَرَبَتِ ٱلسَّاعَةُ وَٱنشَقَّ ٱلْقَمَرُ,"The coming of the Hour is close and the moon split in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the splitting of which was one of the tangible miracles of the Prophet (peace be upon him)."
"But if they see a sign they turn away, and say: ""This is the same old lie continuing,""",1,54,وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُوا۟ وَيَقُولُوا۟ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ,When the idolaters see any sign or proof of the truthfulness of the Prophet (peace be upon him) they turn away from accepting it and say: The evidence and proof we have seen are false sorcery.
"And deny, and follow their own vain desires; but every matter is determined at its time.",2,54,وَكَذَّبُوا۟ وَٱتَّبَعُوٓا۟ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ,"They denied the truth that came to them and followed their desires in this denial. Any matter, whether good or bad, will occur to the one who deserves it on the Day of Judgement."
"Messages deterring them from evil had come to them,",3,54,وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَنۢبَآءِ مَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ,There has come to them reports of the nations that Allah destroyed because of their disbelief and wrongdoing that were sufficient to deter them from their disbelief and wrongdoing.
Containing consummate wisdom; yet warnings were of no avail.,4,54,حِكْمَةٌۢ بَٰلِغَةٌ فَمَا تُغْنِ ٱلنُّذُرُ,What has come to them is complete wisdom to establish the evidence against them. The warnings do not benefit a people who do not have faith in Allah and nor in the last day.
"So turn away from them. When on the Day the crier calls to the painful business,",5,54,فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ يَدْعُ ٱلدَّاعِ إِلَىٰ شَىْءٍ نُّكُرٍ,"Since they do not follow the right path, leave them, O Messenger, and turn away from them waiting for the day when the angel appointed to blow the trumpet will call towards a horrific matter, the like of which was not known by created beings previously."
They will come out of the graves with downcast eyes like an expanding swarm of locusts.,6,54,خُشَّعًا أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ ٱلْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ,"Their gazes will be lowered. They will come out of their graves as if, in their rush towards the place of reckoning, they are scattered locusts."
"They will hasten forward to the caller, gazes fixed. And the unbelievers will say: ""This is the day of untold woe.""",7,54,مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى ٱلدَّاعِ يَقُولُ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ,"Rushing to the caller of that place. The disbelievers will say: This day is a hard one, because of the difficulty and horrors therein."
"The people of Noah had denied before them, and had called Our votary a liar, and said: ""He is possessed,"" and repulsed him.",8,54,كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ فَكَذَّبُوا۟ عَبْدَنَا وَقَالُوا۟ مَجْنُونٌ وَٱزْدُجِرَ,"Prior to these people who rejected your invitation, O Messenger, the people of Noah also denied. They denied My servant, Noah (peace be upon him) when I sent him to them. They said about him: He is insane, and they rebuked him with various forms of swearing, abuse and threats if he did not stop inviting them."
"So he prayed to his Lord: ""I am helpless, deliver me.""",9,54,فَدَعَا رَبَّهُۥٓ أَنِّى مَغْلُوبٌ فَٱنتَصِرْ,Noah called unto His Lord saying: My people have overwhelmed me and they did not respond to me. So take retribution from them by a punishment that you send down on them.
"And We opened up the flood gates of the sky with water pouring down in torrents,",10,54,فَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَٰبَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَآءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ,So I opened the doors of the sky to continuous torrential water.
And We opened up the springs of the earth; and the waters met for a decreed end.,11,54,وَفَجَّرْنَا ٱلْأَرْضَ عُيُونًا فَٱلْتَقَى ٱلْمَآءُ عَلَىٰٓ أَمْرٍ قَدْ قُدِرَ,I burst open the ground and it became springs from which water gushed. The water coming down from the sky met with the water gushing from the ground for a matter that Allah had determined in eternity. Everyone was drowned besides those whom Allah saved.
"But We bore him on a (vessel made) of planks and oakum,",12,54,وَحَمَلْنَٰهُ عَلَىٰ ذَاتِ أَلْوَٰحٍ وَدُسُرٍ,I carried Noah on a vessel that had planks and nails and I saved him and those with him from drowning.
Which sailed right under Our eyes: A recompense for him who had been denied.,13,54,تَجْرِى بِأَعْيُنِنَا جَزَآءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ,"This vessel was sailing on the clashing waves of water under My gaze and protection, as a victory for Noah whose people denied him and rejected what he brought from Allah."
And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone who will be warned?,14,54,وَلَقَد تَّرَكْنَٰهَآ ءَايَةً فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,I have left this punishment that I meted out to them as a lesson and admonition. Is there anyone to take a lesson from that?
How was then My punishment and My commination!,15,54,فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ,How was my punishment to those who denied? How was my warning that I will destroy them?
Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?,16,54,وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,"I have made the Qur’ān easy to remember, so is there anyone to take heed of the lessons and admonishment that it contains?"
The 'Ad had also disavowed. How was then My punishment and My commination!,17,54,كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ,"Ad denied their prophet, Hud (peace be upon him). So reflect- O people of Makkah - how was my punishment to them? And how was my warning to others about their punishment?"
"We let loose against them a violent roaring wind on a day of ill omen, continuous,",18,54,إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحًا صَرْصَرًا فِى يَوْمِ نَحْسٍ مُّسْتَمِرٍّ,I sent on them a severe cold wind on a day of evil and misfortune that will continue with them until they arrive in Hell.

"Do you send it down from the clouds, or We send it down?",68,56,ءَأَنتُمْ أَنزَلْتُمُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُزْنِ أَمْ نَحْنُ ٱلْمُنزِلُونَ,"Are you the ones who cause it to fall from the clouds in the sky, or am I the one who sends it down?"

Will you then not be grateful to Me for sending it down as palatable and a mercy for you?"

And this surely is great evidence if you can understand --,75,56,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ,"And indeed, taking an oath of these orbits is a great thing - if only you were to understand its greatness-, because there are uncountable signs and lessons in it."
That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an,76,56,إِنَّهُۥ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ,"O people! Indeed, the Qur’ān that is recited to you is a noble Qur’ān, because of the great benefits that it contains."
(Inscribed) in the well-kept Book.,77,56,فِى كِتَٰبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ,"It is in a record preserved from the eyes of people, i.e. the Preserved Tablet."
Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).,78,56,لَّا يَمَسُّهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱلْمُطَهَّرُونَ,"Only the angels, pure of sin and defects can touch it."
It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.,79,56,تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"It is a revelation from the Lord of the creations, on His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation?,80,56,أَفَبِهَٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ أَنتُم مُّدْهِنُونَ,"O idolaters! Do you then reject this speech, and not believe in it?"
You live by calling it a lie.,81,56,وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ,"And do you show your gratitude to Allah for the blessings He has provided you with, by rejecting Him and attributing the rain to the setting of stars, by saying, “It rained upon us due to the setting of so and so star”."

"And you wait for the moment (of death),",83,56,وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ,"...and at that time, you see the dying person in front of you..."
"We are closer to him than you, even though you cannot see?",84,56,وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تُبْصِرُونَ,"...whilst My angels are closer to the dying person than you are, but you do not see them..."
"Then why, if you are not indebted (to Us for life),",85,56,فَلَوْلَآ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ,"Why then, if you are not going to be resurrected - as you claim - for requital..."
Can you not bring him back? (Answer) if you are truthful,86,56,تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"...return this soul that is leaving your dead, if you are truthful? You cannot do it."
"Then, if he is one of the honoured,",87,56,فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,As for if the dying person is one of those who hasten towards good...
"There will be peace and plenty, and gardens of tranquility for him.",88,56,فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّتُ نَعِيمٍ,"...he will be in such comfort after which there will be no tiring, good sustenance and mercy. He will have a Paradise in which he will live in luxury, enjoying whatever his soul desires."

"There will be the salutation by those of the right hand: ""Peace on you.",90,56,فَسَلَٰمٌ لَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلْيَمِينِ,"And if the dying person is from the People of the Right, do not worry about their condition, because they will be in peace and security."
"But if he is of the deniers and the errants,",91,56,وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,And if the dying person is from the rejectors of what the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought: the deviators from the straight path...
The welcome will be boiling water,92,56,فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ,"...then he will have some hospitality presented to him, which will be extremely hot water."
And the roasting in Hell.,93,56,وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ,And he will have to burn in the fire of hell.
This is indeed the ultimate truth.,94,56,إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ حَقُّ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"O Messenger! Indeed, the stories I have narrated to you are convincingly true, in which there is no doubt."
"Then praise your Lord, the most supreme.",95,56,فَسَبِّحْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"So glorify the great name of your Lord, and proclaim His purity from all defects."
WHATSOEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,0,57,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Every creation of His in the heavens and the earth proclaims the glory and purification of Allah. He is the almighty whom no one can overpower; the Wise in His creation and His measure.
"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, He is the giver of life and death, and He has power over everything.",1,57,لَهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ يُحْىِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"To Him alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life to whoever He wishes to give life to, and causes death to whoever He wishes to cause death to. He is capable of everything; nothing is outside His ability."
"He is the first and He the last, the transcendent and the immanent; and He has knowledge of everything.",2,57,هُوَ ٱلْأَوَّلُ وَٱلْءَاخِرُ وَٱلظَّٰهِرُ وَٱلْبَاطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"He is the First; nothing existed before Him. He is the Last; nothing will exist after Him. He is the Apparent; there is nothing above Him. He is the Intimate; there is nothing without Him, and He knows everything, He does not miss anything."
"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six stages, then assumed the throne. He knows whatsoever enters the earth, and whatsoever comes out of it, and what comes down from the sky and what goes up to it; and He is with you wheresoever you may be, and He perceives whatsoever you do.",3,57,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلِجُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا وَهُوَ مَعَكُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"He is the one who created the heavens and the earth in six days, starting from Sunday and finishing on Friday, yet He is capable of having created them in less than the duration of the blinking of an eye. He then rose over His Throne as befits Him (may He be glorified). He knows everything that enters the earth, i.e. every drop of rain and every seed etc.; He knows everything that emerges from it, i.e. every shoot, mineral etc.; He knows everything that descends from the sky i.e. rain, revelation etc., and He knows everything that ascends to it i.e. angels, souls and deeds of the servants etc. And He is with you wherever you are O people, in terms of His knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him and He sees everything you do. None of your actions are hidden from Him, and He will requite you for them."
"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him.",4,57,لَّهُۥ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلْأُمُورُ,"To Him alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Him alone return all affairs. He will then take the creations to account on the Day of Judgement and requite them for their deeds."
"He turns night into day, and turns day into night; and He knows whatsoever is in your hearts.",5,57,يُولِجُ ٱلَّيْلَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِى ٱلَّيْلِ وَهُوَ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,He enters the night into the day and so the darkness arrives and people sleep; He enters the day into the night and so the light arrives and people go about their business. He is aware of everything that the hearts of His servants contain; none of it is hidden from Him.
"Believe in God and His Apostle, and spend of what He has given you as His trustee. And those of you who believe and spend in charity will have a great reward.",6,57,ءَامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَأَنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ فَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُوا۟ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,"Bring faith in Allah and bring faith in His Messenger, and spend from the wealth that Allah has made you deputies in, using it according to what Allah has legislated for you. As for those of you who have faith in Allah and spend their wealth in His path, for them is a great reward with Him, which is Paradise."
"What has come upon you that you believe not in God, though the Prophet is calling you to believe in your Lord? And He has already taken your pledge, if you are believers.",7,57,وَمَا لَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِرَبِّكُمْ وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَٰقَكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"And what stops you from bringing faith in Allah, when the Messenger is calling you towards Allah hoping that you bring faith in your Lord (may He be glorified), and Allah has taken a covenant from you that will believe in Him when He took you out from the loins of your fathers? If you believe in that, then believe!"
It is He who sends down splendent revelations to His votary that he may take you out of darkness into light; for surely God is gracious and kind to you.,8,57,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِۦٓ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُم مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"He is the one who sends down clear verses upon His servant Muhammad (peace be upon him), to take you out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance, into the light of faith and knowledge. And indeed, Allah is kind and merciful to you that He sent His Prophet to you as a guide and a bearer of glad tidings."
"What has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of God, when the heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to God? Those of you who spent before the victory and fought, are not equal (to those who did not). They are higher in position than those who spent after (the victory) and fought. To each one God has made the promise of excellence, for God is aware of all you do.",9,57,وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تُنفِقُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَٰثُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَا يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ ٱلْفَتْحِ وَقَٰتَلَ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنفَقُوا۟ مِنۢ بَعْدُ وَقَٰتَلُوا۟ وَكُلًّا وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"And what is stopping you from spending in the path of Allah, when the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah? O believers! Those of you who spent their wealth in the path of Allah seeking His pleasure before the conquest of Makkah and fought the disbelievers in aid of Islam, are greater in rank according to Allah and higher in status than those who spent their wealth in His path and fought the disbelievers after the conquest of Makkah. However, Allah has promised both groups Paradise, and He is aware of your actions; none of them are hidden from Him and He will soon requite you for them."
"Who will give a goodly loan to God which He will double for him, and be for him a splendid reward?",10,57,مَّن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يُقْرِضُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَٰعِفَهُۥ لَهُۥ وَلَهُۥٓ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Who is there that will spend his wealth for the pleasure of Allah happy at heart, so that Allah may grant him a multitude of reward for the wealth he has spent, on top of the noble reward of Paradise he will receive on the Day of Judgement?"
"The day you see the believers, men and women, with their light advancing ahead and to the right of them, (they will be told:) ""There is good news for you this day, of gardens with rivers flowing by where you will live for ever."" This will be the great attainment.",11,57,يَوْمَ تَرَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَسْعَىٰ نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَٰنِهِم بُشْرَىٰكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ جَنَّٰتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"On the day when you will see the believing men and women, with their light ahead of them and to their right. It will be said to them on that day, “Your glad tidings today are of gardens under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, and in which you will live forever. That reward is the great success, that cannot be equalled by any other.”"
"The day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to the believers: ""Wait for us that we may borrow a little light from your light,"" they will be told: ""Go back, and look for your light."" A wall shall be raised between them in which there will be a door. Within it will be benevolence and retribution without.",12,57,يَوْمَ يَقُولُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقَٰتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱنظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ٱرْجِعُوا۟ وَرَآءَكُمْ فَٱلْتَمِسُوا۟ نُورًا فَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُۥ بَابٌۢ بَاطِنُهُۥ فِيهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةُ وَظَٰهِرُهُۥ مِن قِبَلِهِ ٱلْعَذَابُ,"On the day when the hypocrite males and females will say to those who brought faith in Allah and His Messenger: “O believing men and women! Wait for us; perhaps we can take a flare of your light that will help us cross the Bridge?” It will be said to the hypocrites, mocking them: “Turn back and find the light which you can use for yourselves!” A wall will then be placed between them which will have a door; the inner side on which the believers are will have mercy in it, while the outer side on which the hypocrites are will have the punishment."
"They will call to them: ""Were we not with you?"" They will answer: ""Certainly; but then you let yourselves be tempted, and waited in expectation but were suspicious and were deceived by vain desires, till the decree of God came to pass, and the deceiver duped you in respect of God.",13,57,يُنَادُونَهُمْ أَلَمْ نَكُن مَّعَكُمْ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِنَّكُمْ فَتَنتُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَتَرَبَّصْتُمْ وَٱرْتَبْتُمْ وَغَرَّتْكُمُ ٱلْأَمَانِىُّ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَغَرَّكُم بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,"The hypocrites will call out to the believers, saying: “Were we not with you upon Islam and obedience?” The Muslims will reply: “No, you were with us, but you deceived your souls with hypocrisy and doomed them, and you anticipated that the believers are defeated so you can then announce your disbelief. You also doubted in the help of Allah coming for the believers and in the resurrection after death. False ambitions also deceived you, until death came to you whilst you were chasing them, and Satan also deceived you about Allah.”"
"So no ransom will be accepted of you on this day, or of those who refused to believe. Hell will be your refuge and the only friend -- and how evil a destination!""",14,57,فَٱلْيَوْمَ لَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنكُمْ فِدْيَةٌ وَلَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مَأْوَىٰكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ هِىَ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O hypocrites! Today no ransom will be accepted from you from the punishment of Allah, nor from those who disbelieved in Allah openly, and your outcome and the outcome of the disbelievers is the hellfire. It is most deserving of you, and you are most deserving of it; how bad an outcome it is!"
"Has the moment not yet come when the hearts of believers should be moved by the thought of God and the truth that has been sent down, so that they should not be like those who received the Book before them but whose hearts were hardened after a lapse of time, and many of them turned disobedient?",15,57,أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَلَا يَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"Has not the time come for those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger that their hearts soften and become tranquil through the remembrance of Allah (may He be glorified), and through the promises and warnings that have been revealed in the Qur’ān? Has the time not come that they do not become like the Jews who were given the Torah and the Christians who were given the Gospel, in terms of their hearts hardening? This was due to the period prolonging between them and the era of their Prophets. The majority of them left the obedience of Allah, going into His disobedience."
Know that God enlivens the earth even after it has died. We have explained to you clearly Our signs that you may understand.,16,57,ٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحْىِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ ٱلْءَايَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Know that indeed, Allah revives the earth by causing it to grow after it has dried up. O people! Verily Allah has clearly explained the proof and evidence of His capability and oneness, so that perhaps you may understand them and know that the one who revives the earth after its death is also capable of resurrecting you after your deaths, and is capable of making your hearts soft after they have become hard."
"Surely the men and women who spend in charity and give a goodly loan to God, will have it doubled for them and will receive a generous reward.",17,57,إِنَّ ٱلْمُصَّدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُصَّدِّقَٰتِ وَأَقْرَضُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا يُضَٰعَفُ لَهُمْ وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ,"Indeed, those men who spend some of their wealth, and those women who spend some of their wealth, spending it with happiness of heart and without recounting favours or causing harm, their reward will be multiplied for them. Each good deed will be multiplied by ten of its like, up until seven hundred times or more. Together with that, they will receive a generous reward from Allah: Paradise."
"Those who believe in God and His apostles are true of word and deed; and by their Lord are considered testifiers of the truth. They have their guerdon and their light. As for those who do not believe and reject Our revelations, are the people of Hell.",18,57,وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصِّدِّيقُونَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"Those who have faith in Allah and in His messengers without differentiating between them are the ones who are the truthful ones. The martyrs have their generous reward prepared for them with Allah, and they will also have a light which shines in front of them and on their right sides on the Day of Judgement. As for those who disbelieved in Allah and His messengers and rejected My verses that were revealed to My Messenger, they are the people of hell which they will enter on the Day of Judgement and live within forever, never to come out of it."
"Know that the life of this world is only a frolic and mummery, an ornamentation, boasting and bragging among yourselves, and lust for multiplying wealth and children. It is like rain so pleasing to the cultivator for his vegetation which sprouts and swells, and then begins to wither, and you see it turn to yellow and reduced to chaff. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, but also forgiveness from God, and acceptance. As for the life of this world, it is no more than merchandise of vanity.",19,57,ٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌۢ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِى ٱلْأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلْأَوْلَٰدِ كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَعْجَبَ ٱلْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُۥ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَىٰهُ مُصْفَرًّا ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَٰمًا وَفِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَٰنٌ وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا مَتَٰعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ,"Know that the life of the world is only a pastime that the bodies play with; futility that the hearts engage in; beauty that you adorn yourselves with; boasting with one another over possessions and power, and taking pride in abundance of wealth and offspring. It is just like rainfall that pleases the farmers with the growth it brings, but the green growth does not last long before it begins to dry. Then, O onlooker, you see it after its greenery having turned yellow. Allah then turns it into broken bits falling apart. And in theِ Afterlife there will be a severe punishment for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and a special forgiveness from Allah for the sins of His believing servants."
"Hasten for the forgiveness of your Lord and Paradise whose expanse is as wide as that of the heavens and the earth, which has been prepared for those who believe in God and His apostles. This is the bounty of God which He bestows on whosoever He please; and the bounty of God is infinite.",20,57,سَابِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"O people! Hasten towards good deeds i.e. repentance and other actions, through which you will achieve forgiveness for your sins. You will also acquire through them a Paradise the width of which is the width of the heavens and the earth; Allah has prepared this Paradise for those who bring faith in Him and His messengers. That reward is a favour of Allah that He grants whichever of His servants He wishes; He (may He be glorified) is the bestower of great favours to His believing servants."
There is no calamity that befalls the earth or your own selves but in accordance with the law (of causation) before We make it evident. This is indeed how the law of God works inevitably.,21,57,مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِى كِتَٰبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَآ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"No calamity afflicts the people on earth i.e. a drought etc., nor a personal calamity, except that it has been recorded in the Preserved Tablet before I created the creations. Indeed, that is easy for Me."
"Lest you grieve for what you missed, or rejoice at what you received. God does not love the egoist and the braggart,",22,57,لِّكَيْلَا تَأْسَوْا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلَا تَفْرَحُوا۟ بِمَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ,"O people! That is so that you do not grieve over anything you miss out on, and so that you do not show happiness that leads to arrogance over every blessing Allah has given you. Indeed, Allah does not love anyone who is arrogant and boastful over what Allah has granted him."
"Who hold back what they possess and enjoin stinginess on others. Whoever turns away (from God, should remember) that God is self-sufficient, worthy of praise.",23,57,ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"Those who are miserly in spending whatever is obligatory on them to spend and instruct others to be miserly, are losers. Whoever turns away from the obedience of Allah will never harm Allah; he only harms himself. Indeed, Allah is the Self-sufficient; He is in no need of the obedience of His servants, and He is praiseworthy in every state."
"We have surely sent apostles with clear signs, and sent with them the Book and the Balance, so that men may stand by justice; and We sent down iron which causes much distress but also has advantages for men, so that God may know who helps Him and His apostles in secret. Verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty.",24,57,لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مَعَهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ لِيَقُومَ ٱلنَّاسُ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَأَنزَلْنَا ٱلْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَنَٰفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُۥ وَرُسُلَهُۥ بِٱلْغَيْبِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"Verily I sent My messengers with clear evidence and manifest proof, and sent down books with them and the balance, so that people would uphold justice. I also sent down iron in which there is great strength; armour is made from it, together with it having many other benefits for the people in their manufacturing and handicrafts. And also because Allah can make it obvious to the people who it is that supports Him and His messengers in secret. Indeed, Allah is Strong and Almighty; nothing can overcome His decree nor is He incapable of doing anything."
"We sent Noah and Abraham, and gave prophethood to their progeny and the Book, and some of them are well-directed, but many of them are disobedient.",25,57,وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا وَإِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا ٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَٱلْكِتَٰبَ فَمِنْهُم مُّهْتَدٍ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"And verily I sent Noah and Abraham peace be upon him as messengers, and placed messengership in their offspring; I did not send any Prophet except from their progeny, giving them the revealed books; I only revealed books to a messenger from their progeny. So from their progenies are those who were rightly guided to the straight path and are successful, but the majority of them left the obedience of Allah."
"Then in their train We sent Our apostles, and succeeding them Jesus, son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel, and put into the hearts of his followers compassion and kindness. But they created monasticism which had not been prescribed for them by Us except for seeking the pleasure of God; yet they did not observe it as it should have been rightly observed. So We gave those among them who were believers their reward; but most of them are disobedient.",26,57,ثُمَّ قَفَّيْنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِم بِرُسُلِنَا وَقَفَّيْنَا بِعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَءَاتَيْنَٰهُ ٱلْإِنجِيلَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ رَأْفَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ٱبْتَدَعُوهَا مَا كَتَبْنَٰهَا عَلَيْهِمْ إِلَّا ٱبْتِغَآءَ رِضْوَٰنِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا فَـَٔاتَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَٰسِقُونَ,"Then followed them up with my messengers and I sent them one after the other to their nations. I sent after them Jesus the son of Mary and gave him the Gospel, placing gentleness and mercy in the hearts of those who brought faith in him. They were affectionate and merciful to one another, but innovated extremism into their religion and left aside marriage and comforts which I had made permissible for them. I did not seek that from them; they made it necessary upon themselves and in doing so innovating in the religion. I only sought that they follow the My pleasure which they did not do, and so I granted those who believed from them their reward. However, the majority of them left My obedience by rejecting what My Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought to them."
"O you who believe, have fear of displeasing God, and believe in His Prophet. He will give you twice as much of His bounty and place a light for you to walk in, and forgive you, for God is forgiving and kind;",27,57,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَءَامِنُوا۟ بِرَسُولِهِۦ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِۦ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُورًا تَمْشُونَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon whatever He has legislated for them! Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed; He will give you double the reward for your bringing faith in Muhammad (peace be upon him) and in the previous messengers. He will also create for you a light through which you will be guided in your worldly life and which you shall use on the Bridge on the Day of Judgement. He will also forgive your sins and not take you to account for them. And Allah is the bestower of great favours to His servants; no limiter can limit His favour, nor can anyone count it."
"So that the people of the Book may know that they have not the least power over the bounty of God, and that the bounty is wholly in the hands of God to give whosoever He please, for God is the master of infinite bounty.",28,57,لِّئَلَّا يَعْلَمَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَلَّا يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ مِّن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"O believers! Verily I have clearly explained My great favour I have prepared for you in the multitude of rewards, so that the people of the previous Book i.e. the Jews and Christians know that they cannot access any of the favour of Allah in terms of being able to give it to whomsoever they wish, and so that they also know that true favour is in Allah’s Hands (may He be glorified); He grants it to whomsoever He wishes. And Allah is the bestower of great favours, which He exclusively gives to whichever of His servants He wishes."
"GOD CERTAINLY HEARD what the woman who argued with you about her husband, said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation. Verily God hears all, and sees everything.",0,58,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِى تُجَٰدِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌۢ بَصِيرٌ,"O Messenger! Verily Allah has heard the words of the woman (She was Khawlah bint Tha‘labah) who was discussing the issue of her husband with you (who was Aws ibn Al-Ṣāmit) after he had done Ẓihār to her. She was complaining to Allah about what her husband had done to her, and Allah was listening to your exchange of words; nothing is hidden from Him, indeed, He is The Hearing of the speech of His servants and The Seeing of their actions; none of them are hidden from Him."
"Those of you who divorce your wives by calling them 'mothers,' cannot (make them) their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. They surely utter what is unseemly and a lie. But God is forbearing and forgiving.",1,58,ٱلَّذِينَ يُظَٰهِرُونَ مِنكُم مِّن نِّسَآئِهِم مَّا هُنَّ أُمَّهَٰتِهِمْ إِنْ أُمَّهَٰتُهُمْ إِلَّا ٱلَّٰٓـِٔى وَلَدْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَقُولُونَ مُنكَرًا مِّنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَزُورًا وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ,"Those who do Ẓihār to their wives, by saying to them: “You are for me like the back of my mother”, have lied in this statement of theirs. Their wives are not their mothers; their mothers are only those women who gave birth to them, and when they make such statements they are uttering a disgusting, false statement. But indeed, Allah is overlooking and forgiving: He has legislated an atonement for you to free you of the sin."
"Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact (with them). This is to warn you, as God is aware of what you do.",2,58,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُظَٰهِرُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُوا۟ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا ذَٰلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِۦ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"It is necessary upon those who utter this disgusting statement and then intend to have sexual intercourse with the wife they did Ẓihār to, that they make amends by freeing a slave before they have intercourse. This aforementioned ruling you have been commanded to carry out is a reprimand for you for the Ẓihār. And Allah is aware of your actions; none of your actions are hidden from Him."
"If one does not have the means (of doing so) then he should fast for two months continuously before he has physical contact; but any one who is unable to do so, should feed sixty needy persons. This (is enjoined) so that you may be faithful to God and His Apostle. These are the limits set by God. As for the unbelievers, there is painful punishment for them.",3,58,فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِينًا ذَٰلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَلِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"So whoever cannot find a slave to free, it is necessary upon him to fast for two months consecutively before he has sexual intercourse with the wife he did Ẓihār to. Then, whoever is incapable of fasting for two months consecutively, should feed sixty poor people. This command I have given is so that you believe that Allah is the one who has commanded you with it and so you carry it out. These rulings that I legislate for you are My limits I have set for My servants, so do not trespass them. As for those who disbelieve in the commands of Allah and the limits He has set, they will face a painful punishment."
"Those who oppose God will be disgraced, as those before them were. We have sent down very clear signs. For unbelievers there is a shameful punishment.",4,58,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآدُّونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ كُبِتُوا۟ كَمَا كُبِتَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ ءَايَٰتٍۭ بَيِّنَٰتٍ وَلِلْكَٰفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"Indeed, those who regard Allah and His Messenger to be their enemies will be humiliated and exiled, just as the people of the past who regarded them as enemies were humiliated and exiled. Verily I have revealed clear verses, and those who disbelieve in Allah, His Messenger and His verses will face a humiliating punishment."
"On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.",5,58,يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعًا فَيُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوٓا۟ أَحْصَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ وَنَسُوهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,"On the day when Allah will resurrect them all, not leaving any of them out. He will then inform them of their shameful actions in the world which He recorded against them. He misses none of their actions, yet they themselves will forget them but find them having been recorded in their books of deeds, which leave no small or big deed unrecorded. And Allah is aware of everything; none of their actions remain hidden from Him."
"Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? No three persons confer secretly but He is the fourth among them, and no five but He is the sixth; and neither fewer nor more but He is with them wheresoever they be. And on the Day of Judgement He will announce their deeds to them. Verily God has knowledge of everything.",6,58,أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَا يَكُونُ مِن نَّجْوَىٰ ثَلَٰثَةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ رَابِعُهُمْ وَلَا خَمْسَةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ سَادِسُهُمْ وَلَآ أَدْنَىٰ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَآ أَكْثَرَ إِلَّا هُوَ مَعَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كَانُوا۟ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوا۟ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"O Messenger! Do you not see that Allah knows everything that is in the heavens and everything on Earth; nothing within them is hidden from Him? No three people talk among themselves except that Allah (may He be glorified) is the fourth among them through His knowledge; nor do five people talk among themselves except that He may He be glorified is the sixth among them through His knowledge; nor any less or any more than these numbers, except that Allah is with them through His knowledge wherever they may be. No speech of theirs remains hidden from Him; He will then inform them of their actions on the Day of Judgement. Indeed, He knows everything; nothing is hidden from Him."
"Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden them, and conspired evil, rebellion and disobedience to the Prophet? Yet when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even God does not greet you with; and say to themselves, ""Why doesn't God punish us for what we say?"" Hell is sufficient for them, in which they will be burnt: And what an evil consequence!",7,58,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ نُهُوا۟ عَنِ ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَيَتَنَٰجَوْنَ بِٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ وَيَقُولُونَ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلَا يُعَذِّبُنَا ٱللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O Messenger! Do you not see the Jews who used to secretly whisper when they would see a believer, then Allah prohibited them from such whispering, but they would return to committing exactly that which Allah prohibited them from: secretly discussing sin among themselves i.e. backbiting the believers, inciting people against them, and disobedience to the Messenger. O Messenger! When they come to they greet you with a greeting Allah has not taught you to greet with, i.e. by saying: ‘As-sāmu ‘alayk’ meaning ‘death be upon you’, and they say, rejecting the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say? Because if he was truthful in his claim that he is a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we say about him!” Hell is enough of a punishment for them for what they say; they will definitely suffer its heat. What an evil outcome they will face!"
"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.",8,58,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا تَنَٰجَيْتُمْ فَلَا تَتَنَٰجَوْا۟ بِٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَتَنَٰجَوْا۟ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِىٓ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what He has legislated for them! Do not secretly discuss things that incur sin, incite enmity against, or disobedience to the Messenger, in case you become like the Jews. Rather, discuss things that lead to obedience to Allah and refraining from His disobedience. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, because He alone is the one towards whom you will be gathered on the Day of Judgement for accountability and requital."
Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispense. So in God should the believers place their trust.,9,58,إِنَّمَا ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ لِيَحْزُنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَلَيْسَ بِضَآرِّهِمْ شَيْـًٔا إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"Secret discussions that contain sin, inciting enmity and disobedience to the Messenger are only the result of Satan adorning and whispering to his associates, so that he can cause grief to the believers that they are being plotted against. However, neither Satan nor his beautification of things will harm the believers in any way, except if Allah wills and intends it. So it is upon Allah that the believers should rely in all their affairs."
"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. God is aware of what you do.",10,58,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا۟ فِى ٱلْمَجَٰلِسِ فَٱفْسَحُوا۟ يَفْسَحِ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَإِذَا قِيلَ ٱنشُزُوا۟ فَٱنشُزُوا۟ يَرْفَعِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ دَرَجَٰتٍ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"After Allah mentioned the etiquette of speech, He mentions the etiquette of gatherings, and says: O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what Allah has legislated for them! When you are told: “Make space in gatherings”, then make space; Allah will create ease for you in your worldly lives and in the afterlife. And when you are told: “Leave from so and so gathering so that people of virtue may take part in them”, leave those gatherings; Allah (may He be glorified) will raise in great stature those who have faith among you and those blessed with knowledge. And Allah is the knower of whatever you do; none of your actions are hidden from Him, and He will requite you for them."
"O you who believe, if you confer with the Prophet in private, give alms in the name of God before you go to confer. This is better for you and becoming. If you do not have the means, then surely God is forgiving and kind.",11,58,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا نَٰجَيْتُمُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدِّمُوا۟ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَىٰكُمْ صَدَقَةً ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what He has legislated for them! When you intend to talk privately with the Messenger, give some charity before you talk in private with him. That giving in charity will be better and purer for you because of being an act of obedience to Allah that purifies the hearts. But if you do not find anything you can give in charity, there is no harm in you talking in private with him, because Allah Forgiving of the sins of His servants and He is merciful towards them by not burdening them except with what they are capable of."
"Are you afraid of giving alms before confering? Then, if you cannot do this, and God forgives you, be constant in your devotional obligations and pay the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others, and obey God and His Prophet. God is aware of all you do.",12,58,ءَأَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُوا۟ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَىٰكُمْ صَدَقَٰتٍ فَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا۟ وَتَابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Do you fear poverty by presenting charity before talking privately with the Messenger? So when you do not do that which Allah commanded you to do, and Allah forgave you by allowing you not to give in charity, now perform prayer to perfection, give Zakat on your wealth, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is aware of your actions; nothing is hidden from Him and He will soon requite you for them."
"Have you not seen those who have taken a people who have roused the wrath of God, as friends? They are neither of you nor of them, and swear to a lie, and knowingly.",13,58,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْا۟ قَوْمًا غَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلَا مِنْهُمْ وَيَحْلِفُونَ عَلَى ٱلْكَذِبِ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger! Do you not see the hypocrites who befriend the Jews whom Allah is angry with due to their disbelief and sins? These hypocrites are neither from the believers nor from the Jews; rather, they are uncertain between the two: neither are they on one side nor the other. Yet they will swear that they are Muslims and that they did not relate information about the Muslims to the Jews, but they are liars despite their oaths."
God has reserved a severe punishment for them. Evil indeed are the things they do!,14,58,أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them in the afterlife, where He will enter them into the lowest depths of the hellfire. Indeed, the acts of disbelief they commit in the world are shameful."
"They have made their oaths a shield, and obstruct people from the way of God. There is shameful punishment for them.",15,58,ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"They take the oaths they swear as protection against being killed due to disbelief, by outwardly showing Islam to protect their lives and wealth. So they turn the people away from the truth by belittling and hindering the Muslims. Therefore, they will face a humiliating punishment which will humiliate and shame them."
"Neither their wealth nor children will avail them against God. They are the people of Hell, and there will abide for ever.",16,58,لَّن تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Their wealth and their offspring will not benefit them in the slightest. They are the people of the hellfire who will enter it and reside in it for ever, the punishment never stopping on them."
"On the day that God will raise them together, they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and imagine they are on the right path. Is it not they who are liars?",17,58,يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعًا فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُۥ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْكَٰذِبُونَ,"Remember the day when Allah will resurrect them all for requital, not leaving any of them out. They will swear in front of Allah that they were not upon disbelief nor hypocrisy; rather they were only believers who acted in accordance to the pleasure of Allah. They will take oaths in front of Him in the afterlife just as they would take oaths in front of you, O believers, in the world that they were believers. They will think that by taking these oaths in front of Allah they will be in a position to bring some benefit to themselves or prevent some harm falling upon themselves. Know well that indeed, they are true liars in their oaths in the world and in the afterlife."
Satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember God. Indeed they belong to Satan's faction. Will not Satan's faction perish?,18,58,ٱسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَأَنسَىٰهُمْ ذِكْرَ ٱللَّهِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Satan has taken control over them and through his whispers, has made them forget the remembrance of Allah, so they do not act to earn His pleasure, but only do those things that incur His wrath. They are the party of Iblīs and his followers. Know well that indeed, the party of Iblīs and his followers are the losers in the world and the afterlife, because they have sold guidance in exchange for deviance, and Paradise for the hellfire."
Surely those who oppose God and His Prophet will be among the vilest.,19,58,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآدُّونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى ٱلْأَذَلِّينَ,"Indeed, those who regard Allah and His Messenger as enemies are some of the ones whom Allah will humiliate in the world and the afterlife, and the ones who are the most dishonourable from the disbelieving nations."
"God has decreed: ""I will prevail, I and My apostles."" Verily God is powerful and all-mighty.",20,58,كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَأَغْلِبَنَّ أَنَا۠ وَرُسُلِىٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"Allah has decreed in His prevailing knowledge that He and His messengers will definitely be victorious over His enemies with strength and evidence. Indeed, Allah has the power to help His messengers, and is the Almighty who can take retribution from His enemies."
"You will not find those who believe in God and the Day of Resurrection, loving those who oppose God and His Prophet, even though they be their fathers, sons, or brothers or their kin. God has inscribed on their hearts belief, and has succoured them with His own grace, and will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God accepting them, and they, happy in the pleasure of God. They are verily the army of God. Will not the army of God be victorious?",21,58,لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنْ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَلَوْ كَانُوٓا۟ ءَابَآءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَٰنَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ كَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْإِيمَٰنَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"O Messenger! You will not find a people believing in Allah and in the Day of Judgement, who love and befriend those who regard Allah and His Messenger as enemies, even though these enemies of Allah and His messengers happen to be their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribe members they affiliate themselves to. This is because faith prevents them from befriending the enemies of Allah and His Messenger, and because the connection of faith is greater than all connections, so it is to be given priority at times of conflict. Those who do not befriend the enemies of Allah and His Messenger - even if they are their own relatives - are the ones in whose hearts Allah has established faith such that they do not waver, and has strengthened with His proof and light. He will also enter them on the Day of Judgement into everlasting gardens, under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, and in which they shall live forever, without its luxuries ever finishing or them ever becoming extinct. Allah is pleased with them to a degree that He will never be displeased with them afterwards, and they are also pleased with Him because of Him having given them favours which will never finish, one of which is the ability to see Him may He be glorified. They are the party of Allah that fulfils whatever He commands and refrain from the things He does not allow. Know well that indeed, the party of Allah are the ones who will succeed by achieving their objective and remaining safe from their fears in the world and the afterlife."
WHATEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,0,59,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Every creation in the heavens and the earth proclaims the purity and sanctity of Allah from everything that does not befit Him. He is the Almighty whom no one can overcome, the Wise in His creation, legislation and decree."
"It is He who drove those among the people of the Book who refused to believe, from their homes for the first confrontation. You did not think that they would go away, and they imagined that their forts would protect them against God. But God came upon them from where they did not suspect, and filled their hearts with terror, so that they destroyed their homes with their own hands (or were destroyed) by the hands of believers. So take heed, O men of sight!",1,59,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَخْرَجَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ لِأَوَّلِ ٱلْحَشْرِ مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُوا۟ وَظَنُّوٓا۟ أَنَّهُم مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ فَأَتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُوا۟ وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعْبَ يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُم بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَٱعْتَبِرُوا۟ يَٰٓأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَبْصَٰرِ,"He is the one who exiled the Banū an-Naḍīr who had disbelieved in Allah and rejected His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him), from their houses in Al-Madīnah the first time towards the Levant region. They were from the Jews: the people of the Torah. After they had broken their treaty and sided with the idolaters against the Messenger, He exiled them towards the Levant. O believers! You did not think they would leave their homes because of the might and strength they possessed, and they themselves thought that their fortresses they had fortified would protect them from the might of Allah and His punishment. Then, the might of Allah came upon them in a manner they did not anticipate, when He commanded His Messenger to fight them and exile them from their homes. Allah also put extreme fear into their hearts, and they began demolishing their homes with their own hands from the inside so that the believers could not take advantage of them, while the Muslims demolished them from the outside. O people of insight! So take heed of what befell them due to their disbelief and do not be like them, in case you get the same requital as they did, and face the same punishment they faced."
"Had God not decreed the expulsion for them He would have punished them in this world, and in the next the punishment of Hell would have been theirs.",2,59,وَلَوْلَآ أَن كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْجَلَآءَ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِى ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ عَذَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,"Had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would have punished them in the world with execution and captivity, like He did with their brothers from the Banū Qurayḍah. And for them in the afterlife is the punishment of the hellfire that awaits them, wherein they shall live forever."
"For they had opposed God and His Apostle; and whosoever opposes God, then God is severe in retribution.",3,59,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَمَن يُشَآقِّ ٱللَّهَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"Whatever happened to them happened because they took Allah and His Messenger as enemies through their disbelief and breaking of the treaties. And whoever takes Allah as his enemy, Allah is severe in punishment, so he will soon suffer His sever punishment."
"The palm trees that you cut down or left standing intact was by God's dispensation, so that He might disgrace the transgressors.",4,59,مَا قَطَعْتُم مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَىٰٓ أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"O believers! Whatever date palm you cut down to infuriate the enemies of Allah in the battle of the Banū an-Naḍīr, or you left it standing with its trunk to make use of it, was done with the command of Allah; it was not done to cause destruction on earth like they claimed. It was also done so that Allah could humiliate through it those who left the obedience of Allah from the Jews: those that broke the treaties and chose the path of treason over the path of loyalty."
"You did not charge with horse or camel for whatever (spoils) God gave His Apostle from them. In any case, God gives authority to His Apostle over whomsoever He please. God has power over everything.",5,59,وَمَآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلَا رِكَابٍ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُۥ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"And whatever wealth of the Banū an-Naḍīr Allah returned to His Messenger, you did not haste in seeking it through riding on horses or camels, nor did you face any difficulty in acquiring it. Rather, Allah gives power to His Messenger over whatever He wishes, and He has given power to His Messenger over the Banū an-Naḍīr such that he conquered their communities without any fighting. And Allah is capable of everything, Nothing is outside His ability."
"Whatever booty God gives to His Apostle from the people of the cities, is for God and His Apostle, the near relations, the orphans, the needy and wayfarers, so that it does not concentrate in the hands of those who are rich among you. Accept what the Apostle gives you, and refrain from what he forbids, and take heed for yourself and fear God. Surely God is severe of retribution.",6,59,مَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ كَىْ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةًۢ بَيْنَ ٱلْأَغْنِيَآءِ مِنكُمْ وَمَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَىٰكُمْ عَنْهُ فَٱنتَهُوا۟ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"Whatever wealth of the people of the villages Allah favoured His Messenger with without a fight, is for Allah: He can give it to whoever He wishes; it is also for the Messenger to own; for his relatives from the Banū Hāshim and the Banū Al-Muṭṭalib in compensation for the charity they have been prevented from accepting; for the orphans; the needy and the foreigner whose ration has run out. This distribution is so that the wealth is not only confined to the rich rather than the poor. O believers! Whatever wealth of the Fay’ the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he does not allow you to take, then refrain from it. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed. Indeed, Allah is severe in punishment, so fear His punishment."
"The spoils are also for the poor emigrants who were deprived of their homes and possessions and are seeking the bounty and protection of God, and are helping God and His Apostle. They are the ones who are true of word and deed.",7,59,لِلْفُقَرَآءِ ٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُوا۟ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَٰنًا وَيَنصُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّٰدِقُونَ,"A part of this wealth will be spent on the needy who migrated in the path of Allah and were forced to leave their wealth and offspring, hoping that Allah will confer His grace upon them by providing for them in the world and by becoming pleased with them in the afterlife. They also help Allah and His Messenger by striving in the path of Allah. they are the ones who are truly firmly grounded in faith."
"Those who came to the city and to faith before them, love those who take refuge with them, and do not feel for themselves any need for what is given them, and give them preference over themselves even if they are indigent. Whoever preserves himself from his own greed will be prosperous.",8,59,وَٱلَّذِينَ تَبَوَّءُو ٱلدَّارَ وَٱلْإِيمَٰنَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِى صُدُورِهِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّآ أُوتُوا۟ وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"After Allah mentioned the migrants and praised them, He mentions the Helpers and praises them also, saying may He be glorified: And those Helpers who inhabited Al-Madīnah before the Migrants and chose to bring faith in Allah and His Messenger, they love those who migrated to them from Makkah and do not feel any anger or jealousy towards those who migrated in the path of Allah when they are given any of the Fay’ whilst not being given anything themselves. They give priority to the Migrants over themselves in worldly shares, even though they themselves are needy and poor. Whoever Allah saves from the greed of his own self for wealth, and he spends it in His path, they are the ones who are successful by achieving whatever they hope for and gaining salvation from whatever they fear."
"(And the spoils are for) those who came after them, who say: ""O Lord, forgive us and our brothers who came to faith before us, and do not put a grudge in our hearts against those who believe O Lord, You are compassionate and kind.""",9,59,وَٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُو مِنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلِإِخْوَٰنِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِٱلْإِيمَٰنِ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلًّا لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"And those who came after these people and followed them with righteousness until the Day of Judgement, say: “O our Lord forgive us and our brothers in religion who preceded us in bringing faith in Allah and His Messenger, and do not place any grudge or resentment in our hearts for any of the believers. Our Lord! Indeed, You are kind to Your servants and merciful towards them.”"
"Have you never considered the hypocrites? They say to their brethren among the people of the Book who do not believe: ""If you are driven out we shall go with you, and will not listen to any one in what concerns you; and if there is war against you, we shall aid you."" But God is witness they are liars.",10,59,أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُوا۟ يَقُولُونَ لِإِخْوَٰنِهِمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَئِنْ أُخْرِجْتُمْ لَنَخْرُجَنَّ مَعَكُمْ وَلَا نُطِيعُ فِيكُمْ أَحَدًا أَبَدًا وَإِن قُوتِلْتُمْ لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"O Messenger! Do you not see those that have concealed disbelief and outwardly shown faith, saying to their brothers in disbelief from the Jews: the followers of the distorted Torah: “Remain in your homes because we will never abandon you and never give you up. If the Muslims exile you from your homes, we will also leave in solidarity with you, and we will never obey anyone who prevents us from leaving with you. And if they were to fight you, we will definitely help you against them.” Allah testifies that indeed, the hypocrites are liars in their claims that they will leave with the Jews if they were to be exiled, and that they would fight with them if they were fought against."
"If they are driven out, they will not go with them; and if they are attacked, they will not aid them. And even if they aided them, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped.",11,59,لَئِنْ أُخْرِجُوا۟ لَا يَخْرُجُونَ مَعَهُمْ وَلَئِن قُوتِلُوا۟ لَا يَنصُرُونَهُمْ وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمْ لَيُوَلُّنَّ ٱلْأَدْبَٰرَ ثُمَّ لَا يُنصَرُونَ,"If the Muslims exile the Jews, they will not leave with them, and if they fight them, they will neither support nor help them. Even if they go to help or support them against the Muslims, they will flee from the battlefield, after which the hypocrites will never be helped; rather, Allah will humiliate and shame them."
"Surely they have greater fear of you in their hearts than of God, because they do not understand.",12,59,لَأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ رَهْبَةً فِى صُدُورِهِم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ,"O believers! You are more fearful within the hearts of the Jews and hypocrites than Allah. Their extreme fear of you and feeble fear of Allah is because they are a people who have no understanding. If they had understanding, they would know that Allah is more deserving of being feared, because He is the one who gave you power over them."
"They will not fight you in a body except in fortified cities, or from behind the walls. Their enmity among themselves is great. You think they are united, but divided are their hearts. That is because these people are devoid of sense,",13,59,لَا يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ جَمِيعًا إِلَّا فِى قُرًى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرٍۭ بَأْسُهُم بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ تَحْسَبُهُمْ جَمِيعًا وَقُلُوبُهُمْ شَتَّىٰ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَّا يَعْقِلُونَ,"O believers! The Jews will not fight you united except in dwellings fortified with walls, or from behind walls, because they cannot face you due to their cowardice. Their internal might is severe due to their enmity to one another. You think of them to be one force and that their pedestal is one, but the reality is that their hearts are divided and conflicting. This conflict and enmity is because they do not understand; if they were to understand they would recognise the truth and follow it, not dispute in it."
Like those who had tasted the gravity of their actions a little before them. There is a grievous punishment for them.,14,59,كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَرِيبًا ذَاقُوا۟ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"The analogy of these Jews in their disbelief and the punishment that afflicted them, is like that of the idolaters of Makkah not so long before them. They tasted the evil consequences of their disbelief, and on the day of Badr many were killed and others taken captive. They will also face a painful punishment in the afterlife."
"(They are) like Satan who says to man: ""Do not believe;"" and when he becomes a disbeliever, he says: ""I have nothing to do with you. I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds.""",15,59,كَمَثَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِذْ قَالَ لِلْإِنسَٰنِ ٱكْفُرْ فَلَمَّا كَفَرَ قَالَ إِنِّى بَرِىٓءٌ مِّنكَ إِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Their analogy in their listening to the hypocrites is like that of Satan when he beautifies disbelief for the human, then, when he disbelieves because of his beautification of it, he says: “I have nothing to do with you after you have disbelieved; I fear Allah the Lord of the creations.”"
"Both of them will end up in Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is the punishment for the wicked.",16,59,فَكَانَ عَٰقِبَتَهُمَآ أَنَّهُمَا فِى ٱلنَّارِ خَٰلِدَيْنِ فِيهَا وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَٰٓؤُا۟ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"So the ultimate outcome of Satan and whoever followed him will be that they (meaning the followed Satan and the human followers of his) will be in the hellfire on the Day of Judgement, wherein they shall have to remain forever. That requital that awaits them is the requital of those who oppress themselves by trespassing the limits of Allah."
"O you who believe, be fearful of God. Let each soul consider what it has sent (of good deeds) in advance for the morrow, and fear God. Surely God is aware of what you do.",17,59,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon whatever He has legislated for them! Be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things he has not allowed. Each soul should ponder over what good deeds it has send forth for the Day of Judgement. So be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is aware of your actions, none of them are hidden from Him, and He will soon requite you for them."
"And be not like those who have forgotten God, so that God has made them forget themselves. Such are the reprobates.",18,59,وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ نَسُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ فَأَنسَىٰهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَٰسِقُونَ,"Do not become like those who forgot Allah by not fulfilling His commands nor refraining from the things He did not allow, so Allah made them forget themselves and they did not act upon that which would save them from the wrath and punishment of Allah. Those who forgot Allah and did not fulfil His commands or refrain from the things He did not allow are the ones who left the obedience of Allah."
Alike are not the inmates of Hell and the residents of Paradise. The men of Paradise will be felicitous.,19,59,لَا يَسْتَوِىٓ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ وَأَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,"The people of the hellfire and the people of Paradise are not equal. Rather, they are different in their requital just like they differed in their actions in the world. The people of Paradise are the ones who are successful by having achieved whatever they sought and gaining safety from whatever they feared."
If We had sent down this Qur'an to a mountain you would have seen it turn desolate and split into two for fear of God. We offer these examples to men that they may think and reflect.,20,59,لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُۥ خَٰشِعًا مُّتَصَدِّعًا مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ ٱلْأَمْثَٰلُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"If I had revealed this Qur’ān onto a mountain, you would have seen, O Messenger, that mountain, despite its solidity, humbled and fearful due to the extreme fear of Allah. This is because of the scolding admonitions and severe warnings it contains. These analogies that I draw for the people are so that perhaps they use their intelligence and take heed of the lessons and advices its verses contain."
"He is God; there is no god but He, the knower of the unknown and the known. He is the benevolent, ever-merciful.",21,59,هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"23. He is Allāh, the one whom there is no true deity except Him; He is the Knower of the absent and the present: nothing is hidden from Him; the Benevolent of the world and the afterlife and their Merciful: His mercy encompasses the worlds; the Master; the Pure and Sacred from every deficiency; the Faultless from every defect; The Corroborator of His messengers with manifest signs; the Observer of the actions of His servants; the Almighty whom no one can overpower; the Omnipotent who controls everything through His power, the Imperious. Pure and glorified is He from the idols and other things the idolaters ascribe to Him."
"He is God; there is no god but He, the King, the Holy, the Preserver, Protector, Guardian, the Strong, the Powerful, Omnipotent. Far too exalted is God for what they associate with Him.",22,59,هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُ ٱلْمُهَيْمِنُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْجَبَّارُ ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرُ سُبْحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"23. He is Allāh, the one whom there is no true deity except Him; He is the Knower of the absent and the present: nothing is hidden from Him; the Benevolent of the world and the afterlife and their Merciful: His mercy encompasses the worlds; the Master; the Pure and Sacred from every deficiency; the Faultless from every defect; The Corroborator of His messengers with manifest signs; the Observer of the actions of His servants; the Almighty whom no one can overpower; the Omnipotent who controls everything through His power, the Imperious. Pure and glorified is He from the idols and other things the idolaters ascribe to Him."
"He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. His are all the names beautiful. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth sings His praises. He is all-mighty and all-wise.",23,59,هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَٰلِقُ ٱلْبَارِئُ ٱلْمُصَوِّرُ لَهُ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُۥ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"He is the Creator who created everything; the Originator of things; the Fashioner of His creations according to His wishes. For Him may He be glorified are the most beautiful names which contain His lofty attributes. Everything in the heavens and on earth glorifies Him from every deficiency. He is the Almighty whom no one can overpower; the Wise in His creation, legislation and decree."
"O YOU WHO BELIEVE, do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends. You show kindness to them, but they reject the true way that has come to you. They expelled the Prophet and you, for you believe in God your Lord. If you have come out to struggle in My cause having sought My acceptance, (do not be) friendly with them in secret. I know what you hide and what you disclose. Whoever of you does this will have gone astray from the right path.",0,60,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا۟ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِم بِٱلْمَوَدَّةِ وَقَدْ كَفَرُوا۟ بِمَا جَآءَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْحَقِّ يُخْرِجُونَ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَن تُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ خَرَجْتُمْ جِهَٰدًا فِى سَبِيلِى وَٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِى تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِم بِٱلْمَوَدَّةِ وَأَنَا۠ أَعْلَمُ بِمَآ أَخْفَيْتُمْ وَمَآ أَعْلَنتُمْ وَمَن يَفْعَلْهُ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act upon what He has legislated for them! Do not take My enemies and your enemies as intimate friends who you befriend and love, when they have disbelieved in the religion that has come to you at the hands of your Messenger. They also drove the Messenger out of his home in Makkah, and drove you out of your homes in Makkah too. They do not consider the bonds of kinship nor blood in your regard; not due to anything except that you have brought faith in Allah who is your Lord. So if you have truly gone out to strive in My path and to seek My pleasure, do not befriend them while also secretly sending the information about the Muslims, out of your love for them. I know better of what you conceal in that regard, and what you disclose; nothing is hidden from me in any case. And whoever intimately befriends and loves the disbelievers has verily strayed from the middle path, deviated from the truth and avoided that which is right."
"If they gain ascendancy over you, they will become your enemies, and employ their hands and tongues with evil designs, and wish that you also became disbelievers.",1,60,إِن يَثْقَفُوكُمْ يَكُونُوا۟ لَكُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَيَبْسُطُوٓا۟ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُم بِٱلسُّوٓءِ وَوَدُّوا۟ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ,"If they get their chance, they will disclose the enmity they harbour in their hearts towards you and will stretch their hands out to you to harm and beat you, while swearing and abusing you with their tongues. They will also desire that you disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger so that you become just like them."
"Neither your blood relations nor your children will be of any avail to you on the Day of Resurrection. He will judge between you, for God sees what you do.",2,60,لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Your ties of kinship will never benefit you, nor your offspring, if you intimately befriend the disbelievers due to them. On the Day of Judgement, Allah will separate between you and enter the people of Paradise into Paradise and the people of the hellfire into the hellfire, so you will be of no use to one another. And Allah is watchful of your actions; none of them are hidden from Him (may He be glorified) and He will soon requite you for them."
"You have an excellent model in Abraham and those who were with him, when he said to his people: ""We are through with you, and those you worship other than God. We reject you. Enmity and hate have come between you and us for ever, unless you believe in God the One,"" -- except for what he said to his father: ""I shall ask forgiveness for you, but I have no power to prevail with God for you."" ""O Lord, we place our trust in You, and turn to You in penitence, and to You is our returning.",3,60,قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِىٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥٓ إِذْ قَالُوا۟ لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَءَٰٓؤُا۟ مِنكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ ٱلْعَدَٰوَةُ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَحْدَهُۥٓ إِلَّا قَوْلَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ لَأَسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ وَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ رَّبَّنَا عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O believers! You have a beautiful example to follow in Abraham (peace be upon him) and the believers who were with him, when they said to their disbelieving people: “We have nothing to do with you and the idols you worship instead of Allah. We have disbelieved in the religion you are upon; enmity and dislike has become apparent between us and you until you bring faith in Allah alone and do not ascribe anyone as partner to Him.” So it is necessary for you to proclaim innocence from your disbelieving nation just like they did, except for the statement Abraham (peace be upon him) made to his father: “I will definitely seek forgiveness on your behalf from Allah”: do not follow him in that because it was before Abraham lost hope in his father bringing faith. It is therefore not allowed for a believer to seek forgiveness on behalf of an idolater. Neither can you prevent any punishment of Allah coming upon yourself. O our Lord! Upon You we rely in all our affairs, to You we return in repentance, and to you is our return on the Day of Judgement."
"O Lord, make us not an example of punishment for infidels, and forgive us, O Lord. You are all-mighty and all-wise.""",4,60,رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"O our Lord! Do not make us a trial for the disbelievers by giving them power over us, so they can say: “If they were on the truth we would not have been given power over them”, and O our Lord forgive our sins for us, because indeed, You are the Almighty who can never be overpowered; the Wise in your creation, legislation and decree."
"Those of you who have hope in God and the Last Day have certainly a good example in them. But whosoever turns away, then surely God is above concern, worthy of praise.",5,60,لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِيهِمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلْءَاخِرَ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"This good example is only followed by those who have hope for good from Allah in the world and afterlife. Those who turn away from this good example, then Allah is in no need of His servants. He does not require their obedience and He is worthy of praise in every state."
"It maybe that God will create love between you and your enemies. God is all-powerful, and God is forgiving, ever-merciful.",6,60,عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَجْعَلَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ عَادَيْتُم مِّنْهُم مَّوَدَّةً وَٱللَّهُ قَدِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Perhaps Allah will bring about affection between you, O believers, and those disbelievers whom you oppose by guiding them to Islam and they will become your brothers in religion. Allah has power to turn their hearts to faith. Allah Forgiving towards those of His servants who repent and He is merciful towards them."
"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just.",7,60,لَّا يَنْهَىٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,"Allah does not prohibit you from those who have not fought you on account of your Islam, and who have not expelled you from your homes, that you be good and fair to them by giving them any right they have against you. An example of this is how Asma bint Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq behaved with her disbelieving mother when she came to visit her after she had taken permission from the Prophet (peace be upon him) for this and he instructed her to join family ties. Allah loves those who are just to themselves, their families and what they are in charge of."
"He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile. Whoever makes friends with them is a transgressor.",8,60,إِنَّمَا يَنْهَىٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ قَٰتَلُوكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَأَخْرَجُوكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِكُمْ وَظَٰهَرُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ إِخْرَاجِكُمْ أَن تَوَلَّوْهُمْ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"Allah only prohibits you from those who fought you on account of your faith, expelled you from your homes and aided in your expulsion. He prohibits you from aligning yourselves with them. Those of you who align themselves with them, they are the ones who wrong themselves by bringing them to the point of destruction on account of their going against Allah’s instruction."
"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognisant of their faith. If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women. Give the unbelievers what they have spent on them. There is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them. Do not retain your (marriage) ties with unbelieving women. Ask for the return of what you have spent (on them); and the unbelievers should ask for the return of what they have spent. This is the judgement of God. He judges between you. God is all-knowing and all-wise.",9,60,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتُ مُهَٰجِرَٰتٍ فَٱمْتَحِنُوهُنَّ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَٰنِهِنَّ فَإِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُؤْمِنَٰتٍ فَلَا تَرْجِعُوهُنَّ إِلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ لَا هُنَّ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحِلُّونَ لَهُنَّ وَءَاتُوهُم مَّآ أَنفَقُوا۟ وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ إِذَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَلَا تُمْسِكُوا۟ بِعِصَمِ ٱلْكَوَافِرِ وَسْـَٔلُوا۟ مَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ وَلْيَسْـَٔلُوا۟ مَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ ذَٰلِكُمْ حُكْمُ ٱللَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, when believing women come to you as emigrants from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, then test them with respect to the sincerity of their faith. Allah knows best about their faith - nothing of what their hearts contain is hidden from Him. If you are sure of their being believers after such a test that makes their sincerity apparent to you, then do not send them back to their disbelieving husbands. It is not lawful for believing women to be married to disbelievers and it is not lawful for disbelievers to marry believing women. Give their husbands the dowry that they paid. There is no sin on you, O believers, if you marry them after their waiting period is over if you give them their dowry. The person whose wife is a disbeliever or who turned away from Islam, then he should not retain her, because their marriage has terminated by her disbelief. Ask the disbelievers for the dowry you paid to your renegade wives and let them ask for the dowry of their wives who accepted Islam. That - which has been mentioned about your and their returning the dowry - is Allah’s judgment. He (may He be glorified) passes judgment amongst you as He wills. Allah knows the states and actions of His servants. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. He is Wise in what He ordains for His servants."
"If any of your women go away to the unbelievers, and you succeed in your turn (and have a chance of getting spoils), then give to those whose wives have so gone away as much as they had spent on them; but take heed and fear God in whom you believe.",10,60,وَإِن فَاتَكُمْ شَىْءٌ مِّنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ فَعَاقَبْتُمْ فَـَٔاتُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ذَهَبَتْ أَزْوَٰجُهُم مِّثْلَ مَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنتُم بِهِۦ مُؤْمِنُونَ,"If it happens that some of your women leave you for the disbelievers as renegades and you demand your dowry from the disbelievers but they do not give it to you, and thereafter you acquire booty from the disbelievers, then give those husbands whose wives left as renegades the equivalent of the dowry they paid. Be mindful of Allah, in Whom you have faith, by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions."
"O Prophet, when believing women come to you and swear on oath that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor accuse others for what they have fabricated themselves, nor disobey you in any rightful thing, then you should accept their allegiance, and ask forgiveness of God for them. Certainly God is forgiving and kind.",11,60,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰٓ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَٰدَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَٰنٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُۥ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِى مَعْرُوفٍ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O prophet, when believing women come to pledge allegiance to you - as occurred at the time of the conquest of Makkah - that they will not associate anything as partner to Allah, but they will worship Him alone, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children in accordance with the custom of the people of ignorance, nor attribute to their husbands their children from adultery, no go against you in any righteous thing such as His prohibition from wailing, shaving off hair and tearing garments: - then accept their pledge of allegiance, and seek forgiveness for them from Allah for their sins after they pledge allegiance to you. Allah Forgiving to those servants of His who repent to him and He is merciful to them."
"O you who believe, do not make friends with those who have suffered the anger of God by having become despondent of the life to come like those unbelievers who are despondent of those who are in the graves.",12,60,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَتَوَلَّوْا۟ قَوْمًا غَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ قَدْ يَئِسُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ كَمَا يَئِسَ ٱلْكُفَّارُ مِنْ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلْقُبُورِ,"Since the Sūrah commenced with a warning against becoming allies with Allah’s enemies, it ends with a warning against the same to reiterate what was said previously. Allah said: O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, do not take as allies a people with whom Allah is angry. They do not have conviction in the afterlife. Instead they despair of it just like their despair of the return of their dead to them, because they reject resurrection."
ALL THAT IS in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,0,61,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth declares the transcendence and purity of Allah (may He be glorified) from everything that is not appropriate for Him. He is the Mighty whom none can overpower, Wise in His creating, decrees and laws."
"O you who believe, why do you profess what you do not practise?",1,61,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لَا تَفْعَلُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah, why do you say: ‘We did something,’ when in reality you did not do it?! Like the statement of one of you: “I fought and struck with my sword,’ whereas he did not fight and strike with his sword."
Saying what you do not practice is odious to God.,2,61,كَبُرَ مَقْتًا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ مَا لَا تَفْعَلُونَ,"It is a most detested thing to Allah that you say what you do not do. It is only appropriate for a believer to be truthful with Allah, and for his actions to confirm his statements."
Surely God loves those who fight in His cause in full formations as though they were a compact wall.,3,61,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِهِۦ صَفًّا كَأَنَّهُم بُنْيَٰنٌ مَّرْصُوصٌ,"Allah loves the believers who fight in His path seeking His pleasure, in rows alongside one another as if they are a structure that it tightly compacted."
"When Moses said to his people: ""O my people, why do you afflict me though you know that I have been sent to you by God?"" But when they turned aside God made their hearts turn farther away; for God does not show the transgressors the way.",4,61,وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِۦ يَٰقَوْمِ لِمَ تُؤْذُونَنِى وَقَد تَّعْلَمُونَ أَنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ فَلَمَّا زَاغُوٓا۟ أَزَاغَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"After Allah mentioned fighting and praised the believers who stand tightly together in fighting in His path, He mentioned the opposition that the people of Moses and Jesus displayed towards their messengers, as a warning to the believers against opposing their prophet, and He said: Remember, O Messenger, when Moses said to his people: O my people! Why do you hurt me by going against my instruction when you know that I am Allah’s messenger to you?! When they moved away and deviated from the truth that he brought to them, Allah caused their hearts to move away from the truth and steadfastness. Allah does not guide to the truth a people who go against His obedience."
"And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: ""O children of Israel, I am sent to you by God to confirm the Torah (sent) before me, and to give you good tidings of an apostle who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad (the praised one)."" Yet when he has come to them with clear proofs, they say: ""This is only magic.""",5,61,وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًۢا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِنۢ بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُۥٓ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Remember, O Messenger, when Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) said: O Israelites, I am Allah’s messenger. He has sent me to you to confirm the Torah that was revealed before me. I am nothing new among the messengers. I have come to give the good news of a messenger who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad. When Jesus brought the evidence indicating his truthfulness to them, they said: ‘This is clear magic, and we will never follow you.’"
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God when he is called to submit? God does not show the evil-doers the way.,6,61,وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُوَ يُدْعَىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلْإِسْلَٰمِ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"There is none who is more wrong than the one who makes up lies about Allah when he makes rivals for Him that he worships besides Him, whilst he is called to Islam, the religion of pure monotheism for Allah. Allah does not guide a people who wrong themselves by committing idolatry and sins to that in which lies their rectitude and righteousness."
"They want to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies. But God wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers may dislike it.",7,61,يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِـُٔوا۟ نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِۦ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,These deniers want to extinguish Allah’s light with the false statements and distortion of the truth that proceed from them. Allah will perfect His light despite them by making His religion triumph in the east and the west of the earth and by raising His word.
"It is He who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true way to raise it above all faiths, however the idolaters may dislike it.",8,61,هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُۥ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِۦ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ,"Allah is the One Who sent His messenger, Muhammad (peace be on him) with the religion of Islam, the religion of guidance and direction to good, the religion of beneficial knowledge and righteous action, so that He makes it prevail over all other religions despite the idolaters who hate for it to be established on earth."
"O you who believe, may I offer you a bargain which will save you from a painful punishment?",9,61,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ تِجَٰرَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and act on what He has ordained for you, shall I show and guide you to a profitable trade, that will rescue you from a painful punishment."
"Come to believe in God and His Apostle, and struggle in the cause of God, wealth and soul. This will be good for you, if you can understand.",10,61,تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَتُجَٰهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"This profitable trade is that you have faith in Allah and His messenger, and you strive in His path (may He be glorified) by spending your wealth and giving your lives to seek His pleasure. That action is better for you if you know, so rush towards it."
"He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by, and excellent mansions in the garden of Eden. This will be a great fulfilment.",11,61,يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَيُدْخِلْكُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ وَمَسَٰكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِى جَنَّٰتِ عَدْنٍ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,The profit of this trade is that Allah will forgive your sins and enter you into gardens under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow and He will enter you into pleasant homes in gardens of permanence from which you will not be transferred. That mentioned recompense is the supreme success to which no other success can come close.
And (He will give you) what is dearest to you -- help from God and early victory. So give good tidings to those who believe.,12,61,وَأُخْرَىٰ تُحِبُّونَهَا نَصْرٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Part of the profit of this trade is another feature that you love, which is immediate in this world, that Allah will assist you against your enemy, and He will give you an imminent victory which is the conquest of Makkah and other places. O Messengers, tell the believers about the victory that will please them in the world and the attainment of Paradise in the afterlife."
"O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, had said to the disciples: ""Who will help me in the way of God?"" and they had answered: ""We are the helpers of God."" Then a section among the children of Israel believed, but a section among them did not. So We helped those who believed against their enemies, and they prevailed over them.",13,61,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُونُوٓا۟ أَنصَارَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَا قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ لِلْحَوَارِيِّۦنَ مَنْ أَنصَارِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنصَارُ ٱللَّهِ فَـَٔامَنَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنۢ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَكَفَرَت طَّآئِفَةٌ فَأَيَّدْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ عَلَىٰ عَدُوِّهِمْ فَأَصْبَحُوا۟ ظَٰهِرِينَ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, become Allah’s helpers by helping His religion that was brought by your messenger, just as the disciples provided their help when Jesus (peace be upon him) told them: ‘Who will be my helpers to Allah?’ They replied to him at once: ‘We are Allah’s helpers.’ So a group of the Israelites believed in Jesus (peace be upon him) and another group disbelieved. Then We supported those who believed in Jesus against those who rejected him and they became dominant."
"ALL THAT IS in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God the King, the Holy, Omnipotent, the Wise.",0,62,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ٱلْمَلِكِ ٱلْقُدُّوسِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"All created things in the heavens and all created things on earth declare Allah’s transcendence and purity from every attribute of deficiency that is not appropriate for Him. He is the Sovereign, Who is alone in His sovereignty, free from every deficiency, the Mighty Whom none can overpower, the Wise in His creating, decree and laws."
"It is He who raised among the gentiles an apostle from amongst them, who recites His revelations to them, reforms them and teaches them the Scripture and the Law, for before him they were clearly in error.",1,62,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى بَعَثَ فِى ٱلْأُمِّيِّۦنَ رَسُولًا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"He is the One Who sent amongst the Arabs, who could neither read nor write, a messenger from their own kind, reciting to them His verses, which He revealed to him, purifying them from disbelief and bad morals, teaching them the Qur’ān and teaching them the Sunnah. Prior to his being sent to them they were clearly misguided from the truth, as they used to worship idols, spill blood and sever family ties."
And for others among them who have not joined them yet. He is all-mighty and all-wise.,2,62,وَءَاخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ لَمَّا يَلْحَقُوا۟ بِهِمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"He sent this messenger to another people from the Arabs and others that have not come yet, but who are still to come. He is the Mighty Whom none can overpower, the Wise in His creating, laws and decree."
"This is the bounty of God, He gives whosoever He please. God is master of great bounty.",3,62,ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,That which has been mentioned - about sending the messenger to the Arabs and to others - is Allah’s grace that He gives to whoever He wishes. Allah possesses great favour and part of His great favour is the sending of the messenger of this nation to all of mankind.
"The likeness of those who were charged with (the law of) the Torah which they did not observe, is that of a donkey who carries a load of books (oblivious of what they contain). How wretched the semblance of the people who deny the words of God! God does not show an unjust people the way.",4,62,مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ حُمِّلُوا۟ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَحْمِلُوهَا كَمَثَلِ ٱلْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًۢا بِئْسَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"After Allah mentioned His favour by sending the messenger and revealing the Qur’ān, He mentions the conduct of some of the followers of Moses (peace be upon him) who turned away from practicing on what was contained in the Torah, as a warning to this nation against following them, and He said: The example of the Jews who were charged with carrying out what was contained in the Torah and who left out what they were charged with, is like that of a donkey carrying huge books. It does not know what has been loaded onto it. Is it books or something else? How bad is the example of those who deny Allah’s words. Allah does not guide people who do wrong to reach the truth."
"Say: ""O you Jews, if you claim that you are the favourites of God apart from all men, then wish for death, if you speak the truth.",5,62,قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوٓا۟ إِن زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا۟ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Say, O Messenger: O you who have remained on Judaism after it was distorted, if you claim that you are Allah’s friends, whom He has specifically chosen as friends to the exclusion of other people, then hope for death, so that He can quickly give you the honour He has chosen for you - according to your claim - if you are true in your claim that you are Allah’s friends to the exclusion of other people."
"But they will never wish for death because of what they had done in the past, and God knows the sinners well.",6,62,وَلَا يَتَمَنَّوْنَهُۥٓ أَبَدًۢا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"They will never hope for death. Instead they will hope to remain forever in the world because of the disbelief, sins and wrong they did and the distortion and changes they made to the Torah. Allah knows those who do wrong. Nothing of their actions is hidden from Him and He will give them the recompense for that."
"Tell them: ""Death from which you run, will surely come to you. You will then be sent back to Him who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you what you used to do.",7,62,قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْمَوْتَ ٱلَّذِى تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ فَإِنَّهُۥ مُلَٰقِيكُمْ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"Say, O Messenger, to these Jews: The death from which you flee will inevitably catch up with you sooner or later. Then you will return on the Day of Resurrection to Allah, Who knows everything that is seen or unseen. Nothing is hidden from Him. He will then tell you about what you used to do in the world and give you the recompense for that."
"O you who believe, when the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hasten to remember God, putting aside your business. This is better for you if you can understand.",8,62,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوٰةِ مِن يَوْمِ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ فَٱسْعَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَذَرُوا۟ ٱلْبَيْعَ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, when the caller to prayer calls out on the day of Friday after the speaker ascends the pulpit, then hurry to the mosques to attend the speech and the prayer and leave trading, so that it does not distract you from obedience. That hurrying and leaving out trading after the call for the Friday prayer is better for you, O believers. If you know that, then fulfil what Allah has instructed you to do."
"And when the service of prayer is over spread out in the land, and look for the bounty of God. and remember God a great deal that you may prosper.",9,62,فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ فَٱنتَشِرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱبْتَغُوا۟ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"When you have completed the Friday prayer then spread out on earth searching for lawful earnings and the fulfilment of your needs, and seek of Allah’s bounty by way of lawful earnings and lawful profit. Remember Allah abundantly during your search for provision and do not let your search for provision make you forget Allah’s remembrance, in the hope that you will attain what you love and be saved from what you fear."
"Yet when they see some buying and selling, or some sport, they go for it, leaving you standing. Tell them: ""What is with God is better than your sport and commerce. And God is the best of providers.""",10,62,وَإِذَا رَأَوْا۟ تِجَٰرَةً أَوْ لَهْوًا ٱنفَضُّوٓا۟ إِلَيْهَا وَتَرَكُوكَ قَآئِمًا قُلْ مَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهْوِ وَمِنَ ٱلتِّجَٰرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"When some Muslims see a trade or entertainment they disperse, going out towards it and leave you, O Messenger, standing on the pulpit. Say, O Messenger-: The recompense for righteous action with Allah is better than the trade and entertainment that you go out towards. Allah is the best of providers."
"WHEN THE HYPOCRITES come to you, they say: ""We affirm that you are the Apostle of God."" God indeed knows you are His Apostle. God bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.",0,63,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقُونَ قَالُوا۟ نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ لَكَٰذِبُونَ,"When the hypocrites, who outwardly profess Islam and inwardly conceal disbelief, come to your gathering, O Messenger, they say: ‘We testify that you are truly the messenger of Allah.’ Allah testifies that the hypocrites are lying in their claim that they testify from the depth of their hearts that you are His messenger."
They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do.,1,63,ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَيْمَٰنَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّوا۟ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ,They have made the oaths that they swear on their claim of faith a cover and protection for them from being killed or imprisoned. They turned people away from faith by the doubts and rumours that they spread. Evil is the hypocrisy and false oaths that they perpetrate.
"That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith). So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand.",2,63,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُوا۟ ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا۟ فَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ,"That is because they hypocritically professed faith, but faith did not reach their hearts, and then they secretly rejected Allah, so He put a seal on their hearts on account of their disbelief so that faith cannot enter it. Due to this seal they do not understand that in which lies their rectitude and righteousness."
"Pleasing seem their persons when you look at them; and when they talk, you listen to their speech. Yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall. They imagine every rebuke to be directed against them. They are the enemies, beware of them. May God damn them, how pervert are they!",3,63,وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ تُعْجِبُكَ أَجْسَامُهُمْ وَإِن يَقُولُوا۟ تَسْمَعْ لِقَوْلِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ خُشُبٌ مُّسَنَّدَةٌ يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ هُمُ ٱلْعَدُوُّ فَٱحْذَرْهُمْ قَٰتَلَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,"When you see them, their appearance and form impresses you, because of the youthfulness and luxury they possess. If they speak, you listen to their speech because of its eloquence. As if they are propped-up timber in your gathering, O Messenger. They do not understand or pay heed to anything. They think that every sound is targeting them because of their cowardice. They are truly the enemy, so be careful, O Messenger, that they do not divulge a secret of yours or make a plot against you. May Allah curse them! How are they deluded from faith despite the clarity of its evidence and its glaring proof!"
"When you tell them: ""Come, let the Apostle of God ask forgiveness for you,"" they turn their heads, and you see them turning away with arrogance.",4,63,وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا۟ يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ لَوَّوْا۟ رُءُوسَهُمْ وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"When these hypocrites are told: Come to the Messenger of Allah and apologize for what you’ve done, he will seek from Allah forgiveness for your sins, they turn their heads in mockery and jest, and you see them turning away from what they are instructed to do, whilst they are too proud to accept the truth and submit to it."
"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask, it is all the same; God will not forgive them. Surely God does not show a disobedient people the way.",5,63,سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ لَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"It is the same whether you, O Messenger, seek forgiveness for their sins or you do not seek forgiveness for them. Allah will never forgive their sins. Allah does not guide those who go against His obedience and who persist in disobeying Him."
"They are the ones who say: ""Do not spend on those who are with the Apostle of God till they break away (from him)."" To God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do not understand.",6,63,هُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ لَا تُنفِقُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَنْ عِندَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ حَتَّىٰ يَنفَضُّوا۟ وَلِلَّهِ خَزَآئِنُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ,"They are the ones who say: “Do not spend your wealth on those poor people who are with the Messenger of Allah and the bedouins around Madina so that they disperse away from him.”The treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah alone. He grants them to whichever servants of His He wishes. But the hypocrites do not know that the treasures of provision are in His hand, may He be glorified."
"They say: ""If we now go back to Madina, the stronger will turn the weaker out."" But power belongs to God, His Apostle and the faithful, though the hypocrites do not know.",7,63,يَقُولُونَ لَئِن رَّجَعْنَآ إِلَى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لَيُخْرِجَنَّ ٱلْأَعَزُّ مِنْهَا ٱلْأَذَلَّ وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْعِزَّةُ وَلِرَسُولِهِۦ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"Their leader, Abdullah bin Ubayy, says: If we return to Madina, the mighty - which is me and my people - will drive out the weak - which is Muhammad and his companions. To Allah alone belongs all might and to His Messenger and to the believers, and not to Abdullah bin Ubayy and his followers. But the hypocrites do not know that might belongs to Allah and to His Messenger and to the believers."
"O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God. Those who do so will be losers.",8,63,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَٰلُكُمْ وَلَآ أَوْلَٰدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"After Allah showed the keenness of the hypocrites on holding back from spending in order to prevent others from Allah’s path, He warns the believers against doing the same and instructs them to spend in His path by saying: O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, do not let your wealth nor your children distract you from the prayer or any of the other obligations of Islam. Those whose wealth and children distract them from the prayer and the other obligations that Allah has imposed on them, they are the true losers who will lose themselves and their families on the day of judgment."
"Spend of what We have given you before death comes to one of you, when he will say: ""O Lord, why did you not defer my term for a while that I could give alms and be among the doers of good?""",9,63,وَأَنفِقُوا۟ مِن مَّا رَزَقْنَٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَيَقُولَ رَبِّ لَوْلَآ أَخَّرْتَنِىٓ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ فَأَصَّدَّقَ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,"Spend from the wealth that Allah has provided to you before death comes to one of you and he says to his Lord: Lord, if only You would reprieve me for a short while, I would give charity from my wealth in Allah’s path and I would be one of Allah’s righteous servants whose actions are righteous."
But God does not grant a soul respite once its term has come to end. And God is aware of what you do.,10,63,وَلَن يُؤَخِّرَ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهَا وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah(may He be glorified), will never reprieve a soul when its time comes and its life has ended. Allah is aware of what you do. Nothing of that is hidden from Him and He will recompense you for the same, if good then with good, and if evil then with bad."
"ALL THAT THERE is in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. His the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He has power over everything.",0,64,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,All created things in the heavens and all created things on earth declare Allah’s transcendence and purity from every attribute of deficiency that is not appropriate for Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him alone and there is no sovereign besides Him. Good praise is due to Him alone. He has power over all things. Nothing is outside His ability.
"It is He who created you, though one of you is an infidel and one of you a believer; yet God perceives what you do.",1,64,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنكُمْ كَافِرٌ وَمِنكُم مُّؤْمِنٌ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"He is the One Who created you, O people. Some of you reject Him, and their destination is the Fire, and some of you have faith in Him, and their destination is Paradise. Allah sees what you do. None of your actions are hidden from Him and He will give you the recompense for them."
"He created the heavens and the earth with deliberation, and gave you form, and shaped you well; and to Him is your returning.",2,64,خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَصَوَّرَكُمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُمْ وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"He created the heavens and He created the earth with truth. He did not create them in vain. He formed you, O people - and made your forms beautiful as a favour and bounty from Him. If he wished, He could have made them ugly. To Him alone is the return on the Day of Judgement and He will give you the recompense of your actions, if good then with good, and if evil then with bad."
"He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you hide and what you disclose; God knows what is in the hearts.",3,64,يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُسِرُّونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,He knows whatever is in the heavens and He knows whatever is on earth. He knows the actions that you conceal and those that you reveal. Allah is the Knower of the good or bad that the hearts contain. Nothing of that is hidden from Him.
"Has not the account of those who disbelieved before come to you, who tasted the torment of their action, and for whom is grievous punishment?",4,64,أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَؤُا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ فَذَاقُوا۟ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Has the news of the nations who denied before you not reached you, O idolaters - such as the people of Noah, the Ad, the Thamud and others. They tasted the punishment of the disbelief they had perpetrated in the world, and in the afterlife they will receive a painful punishment. Indeed, that has come to you. So take a lesson from their eventual outcome and repent to Allah before that which befell them befalls you."
"This was so because their apostles came to them with clear proofs, but they said: ""What. Can a mortal show us the way?"" And they denied and turned away; but God was unconcerned. God is all-sufficient, worthy of praise.",5,64,ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُۥ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَقَالُوٓا۟ أَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا فَكَفَرُوا۟ وَتَوَلَّوا۟ وَّٱسْتَغْنَى ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ غَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ,"That punishment which came on them, only came on them on account of the fact that their messengers used to bring clear evidence and glaring proof from Allah, but they said in denial of the fact that messengers could be from the human race: ‘Are human beings going to guide us to the truth?!’ So they disbelieved and turned away from having faith in them. But they did not harm Allah at all. Allah is in no need of their faith and obedience, because their obedience does not increase him in anything. Allah is Self-Sufficient and in no need of His servants. He is praiseworthy in His statements and actions."
"The unbelievers claim that they will not be raised again. Tell them: ""Why not? By my Lord, you will certainly be raised again, and then informed of what you had done. That is how the law of God works inevitably.""",6,64,زَعَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا۟ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّى لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah claimed that Allah will not bring them back to life after their death. Say, O Messenger, to these people who deny resurrection: Indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected on the day of judgment. Then you will be told about what you used to do in the world. Resurrection is easy for Allah, for He had created you the first time. Thus, He is able to bring you back to life after your death for the reckoning and recompense."
"So believe in God, His Apostle and the Light We have sent down. God is well aware of what you do.",7,64,فَـَٔامِنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ وَٱلنُّورِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلْنَا وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"So have faith, O people, in Allah and have faith in His Messenger. Have faith in the Qur’ān which I revealed to My messenger. Allah is aware of what you do. None of your actions are hidden from Him and He will give you the recompense for them."
"The day He will gather you together on the Day of Gathering, will be the day of Judgement. He who believed and did the right, will have his evil deeds expunged by God and admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by, and abide there perpetually. This will be the great achievement of success.",8,64,يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْجَمْعِ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمُ ٱلتَّغَابُنِ وَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَٰلِحًا يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِۦ وَيُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"Remember, O Messenger, the day when Allah will gather you on the Day of Judgement to give you the recompense for your actions. That is the day when the loss of the disbelievers will become clear, as the believers will inherit the homes of the people of the Fire in Paradise, and the people of the Fire will inherit the homes of the people of Paradise in the Fire. Those who have faith in Allah and do righteous deeds, Allah will remit their sins from them and enter them into gardens, under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, to live in them forever and never to come out, the bliss of which will not end. That which they attained is the great success, which no other success can come close to."
"Those who did not believe and denied Our revelations will be inmates of Hell, where they will abide for ever, and how evil a journey's end!",9,64,وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَكَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"Those who disbelieved in Allah and reject My verses, which I revealed to My messenger, they are the people of the Fire who will remain there forever. What an evil destination is theirs!"
No calamity befalls unless God dispenses. He guides the heart of whosoever believes in God; and God has knowledge of everything.,10,64,مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ يَهْدِ قَلْبَهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"No one is afflicted with any difficulty in himself, his wealth or his children except by Allah’s decree and decision. Those who have faith in Allah and in His decree and decision, Allah guides their hearts to submit to his Command and to be pleased with His decree. Allah knows everything, nothing is hidden from Him."
"Obey God and obey His Apostle. If you turn away, the duty of the Apostle is to convey the message clearly.",11,64,وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"Follow Allah and follow the Messenger. If you turn away from what the Messenger brought to you, then the sin of such turning away is to your detriment. The Messenger’s duty is only to convey what I have instructed him to convey, and He has conveyed what he was instructed to convey."
God: There is no god but He; and in God should believers place their trust.,12,64,ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,Allah is the Being deserving of worship. There is no other being deserving of worship besides Him. Let the believers place their reliance in Allah alone in all their affairs.
"O believers, some of your spouses and children are your enemies, so beware of them! Yet if you forbear, overlook, and forgive, God is indeed forgiving and kind.",13,64,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَٰدِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُمْ وَإِن تَعْفُوا۟ وَتَصْفَحُوا۟ وَتَغْفِرُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O you who have faith in Allah, and who act on what He has ordained for you, among your wives and your children there is an enemy of yours, because they will distract you from the remembrance of Allah and striving in His path and they will discourage you. So be careful of their having an effect on you. If you overlook, ignore and cover up their mistakes, then Allah will forgive your sins and have mercy on you. The recompense will be of the same kind as the deed."
Your wealth and children are surely meant as trial for you: But with God is the great reward.,14,64,إِنَّمَآ أَمْوَٰلُكُمْ وَأَوْلَٰدُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُۥٓ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,Your wealth and your children are a trial and test for you. They may entice you to earn the unlawful and leave out following Allah. Allah has with Him great reward for those who give preference to following Him over following their children and becoming occupied with wealth. This great recompense is Paradise.
"So fear God as much as you can, and listen and obey, and spend in charity for your own good. He who is saved from his own avarice will be successful.",15,64,فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ وَٱسْمَعُوا۟ وَأَطِيعُوا۟ وَأَنفِقُوا۟ خَيْرًا لِّأَنفُسِكُمْ وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"So be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His instructions and avoiding His prohibitions as far as you can follow Him. Listen and follow Allah and His messenger. Spend your wealth, which Allah has provided to you, in avenues of good. Those whom Allah has protected from the greed of their souls, they are the ones who will attain what they desire and who will be saved from what they fear."
"If you lend a goodly loan to God, He will double it for you, and forgive you. God knows the worth of good deeds and is clement,",16,64,إِن تُقْرِضُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا يُضَٰعِفْهُ لَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَكُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"If you give Allah a good loan, by spending your wealth in His path, He will multiply the reward for you by making each good deed equal to ten of its like, up until seven hundred times or even more, and He will overlook your sins. Allah is Appreciative and gives huge reward for little action, and He is Forbearing and does not rush to punish."
"The knower of the unknown and the known, all-mighty and all-wise.",17,64,عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Allah (may He be glorified) knows what is in the Ghaib and He knows what is present. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. He is the Mighty, Whom none can overpower, the Wise in His creating, decrees and laws."
"O PROPHET WHEN you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period, and calculate that period, and fear God, your Lord. Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they go away themselves, unless they are openly guilty of adultery. These are the limits set by God. Any one who exceeds the limits set by God sins against his own self. You never know that God may perchance lead to a new situation after this.",0,65,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُوا۟ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لَا تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِنۢ بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلَا يَخْرُجْنَ إِلَّآ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُۥ لَا تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ أَمْرًا,"O Prophet! If you or any of the men from your nation intend to divorce your wives, then he should issue a divorce to her considering her waiting period. That is that the divorce should be issued in a period of purity between two separate menses, in which he has not had sexual relations with her. Also, keep track of the waiting period, so that you are able to take your wives back within it if you intend to do so. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed; do not force your divorced wives out of the homes they live in, until their waiting periods finish, except if they commit an obvious shameful act i.e. adultery. Those are the limits of Allah He has set for His servants; whoever trespasses the limits of Allah has indeed, oppressed himself by placing himself in a situation of doom, because of disobeying his Lord. O divorcée! You do not know, perhaps Allah may create a longing in the heart of the spouse, and he may take his wife back."
"When they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them lawfully or let them go honourably; but have two witnesses from among you, and give truthful evidence for (being acceptable to) God. This is to warn him who believes in God and the Last Day. God will furnish a way out for him who fears Him,",1,65,فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُوا۟ ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَٰلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِۦ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُۥ مَخْرَجًا,"So when they draw nearer to the end of their waiting periods, take them back if you long to do so, while maintaining the best of conduct, or do not take them back until their waiting periods finish and they gain control over their own affairs, after fulfilling for them their rights. And if you intend to either take them back or separate from them, make two honest people from among you witness it to dispel any dispute in future. O witnesses! Give testimony seeking the pleasure of Allah. These laws are mentioned to remind those that bring faith in Allah and in the Day of Judgement, because it is them who truly benefit from reminders and advice. And whoever is mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, Allah will create an exit for him from every difficulty and worry."
And provide for him from where he does not reckon. God is sufficient for him who places his trust in Him. Certainly God fulfills His purpose. God has indeed fixed a measure of everything.,2,65,وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُۥٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَٰلِغُ أَمْرِهِۦ قَدْ جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْرًا,"And He will provide for him in ways he did not even imagine, nor had ever thought of. Whoever relies on Allah in his matters, He will be sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will make His decision come to pass; nothing makes him incapable nor does He miss anything. He has appointed a fixed time for everything, so the severity and ease both have fixed times; they are never permanent on the human."
"As for your women who have lost hope of menstruation, and in case you have a doubt, the prescribed period (of waiting) for them is three months, as also for those who have not menstruated yet. As for those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until the delivery of the child. God will make things easy for him who is mindful of God.",3,65,وَٱلَّٰٓـِٔى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ ٱلْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَٰثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱلَّٰٓـِٔى لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُو۟لَٰتُ ٱلْأَحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُۥ مِنْ أَمْرِهِۦ يُسْرًا,"As for those divorcées who have no hope in menstruating due to old age, if you doubt in the manner of calculating their waiting period, then it is three months. Likewise, the waiting period of girls who have not reached the age of puberty and hence do not menstruate, their waiting period will also be three months. As for pregnant women, their waiting period after divorce or being widowed is when they give birth. Whoever is mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, Allah will make his affairs easy for him and make easy every difficult matter."
"This is the commandment of God that is sent down to you. God will forgive the ills of those who fear Him, and increase their reward.",4,65,ذَٰلِكَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُۥٓ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّـَٔاتِهِۦ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُۥٓ أَجْرًا,"O believers! The aforementioned laws of divorce, revocation and waiting periods are the laws of Allah which He has revealed upon you so that you may implement them. And whoever is mindful of Allah by fulfilling his commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, Allah will erase the bad deeds that he committed from his record and grant him a great reward in the afterlife, i.e. Paradise and everlasting blessings."
"House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances. If they are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth to the child. And if they suckle the child for you, then make the due payment to them, and consult each other appropriately. But if you find this difficult, let some other woman suckle (the child) for her.",5,65,أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلَا تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُوا۟ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُو۟لَٰتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُوا۟ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَٔاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُوا۟ بَيْنَكُم بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُۥٓ أُخْرَىٰ,"After Allah mentioned the laws of divorce and revocation, He then mentions the laws of providing expenses and shelter, saying: O husbands! House them wherever you yourselves live, according to your means; Allah does not burden you with anything other than that. Do not put any restriction in expenses and shelter upon them, hoping to place them in difficulty. If the divorcée is pregnant, spend on her until she gives birth, and if she breastfeeds your child for you then give her the wage of her breastfeeding. Come to a mutual agreement over the matter of the wage with appropriate courtesy; if the husband shows miserliness in the wage the wife wants, or if she shows greed and is not content with anything except her demands, then the father of the child should hire a foster mother who breastfeeds his child for him."
"Let the man of means spend according to his means, and he whose means are limited, should spend of what God has given him. God does not burden a soul beyond what He has given him. God will bring ease after hardship.",6,65,لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِۦ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُۥ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا مَآ ءَاتَىٰهَا سَيَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْرًا,"Whoever has abundance in wealth should spend well on the wife he has divorced and upon his child; and whoever is financially restricted should spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah does not burden any soul except with what He has provided it with, never does He burden them with more than that or more than the strength it holds. Allah will soon create abundance and independence after his difficult state."
"How many habitations rebelled against their Lord's command and His apostles; but We took them to severe task, and punished them with the harshest punishment.",7,65,وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِۦ فَحَاسَبْنَٰهَا حِسَابًا شَدِيدًا وَعَذَّبْنَٰهَا عَذَابًا نُّكْرًا,"After Allah mentioned a set of commands, He then warns against turning away from them and mentions the evil outcome of doing so. He says: There are many communities whom I took to account severely for their evil deeds, after they had disobeyed the commands of their Lord may He be glorified and His Messengers (peace be upon them). I also punished them with a horrible punishment in the world and the afterlife."
So they tasted the pain of their actions; and the consequence of their deeds was ruin.,8,65,فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْرًا,"So they tasted the outcome of their evil deeds, and their finale was losing out in the world and losing out in the afterlife."
"God has prepared for them severe punishment. So, you men of wisdom, and those who believe, take heed for yourselves and fear God. God has indeed sent down a Reminder for you,",9,65,أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَٰٓأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَٰبِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قَدْ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْرًا,"Allah has prepared for them a strong punishment, so be mindful of Allah, O people of intelligence, who have faith in Allah and His Messenger - by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, so that the same punishment that afflicted them does not afflict you as well. Verily Allah has revealed a reminder that reminds you of the evil outcome of disobeying Him, and the good outcome of obeying him."
"An Apostle who recites before you the explicating revelations of God that He may bring those who believe and do the right out of darkness into light. Whosoever believes in God and does the right, He will admit into gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever. How excellent a provision has God made for him",10,65,رَّسُولًا يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَٰتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَٰلِحًا يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا قَدْ أَحْسَنَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ رِزْقًا,"This reminder is a Messenger of His who recites His clear verses to you, wherein there is no ambiguity, in the hope that he removes those who have faith in Allah and believe in His Messenger and do good deeds, from the darkness of deviance into the light of guidance. And whoever has faith in Allah and does good deeds, Allah will enter them into gardens under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, and wherein they will reside forever. Verily Allah will sustain them well by entering them into a Paradise, the bounties of which shall never finish."
"It is God who created several skies, and as many earths. The commandment is sent down among them so that you may know that God has power over everything, and everything is held within the knowledge of God.",11,65,ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ ٱلْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِتَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًۢا,"Allah is the one who created the seven heavens. He also created seven earths just like He created seven heavens. His instructions related to matters of the universe and religion descend through the heavens. Perhaps this will make you realise that Allah is capable of everything, and that He be glorified has encompassed everything with His knowledge; nothing is hidden from Him in the heavens or the earth."
"O PROPHET, WHY should you forbid (yourself) what God has made lawful for you, in order to please your wives? Yet God is forgiving and kind.",0,66,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ لِمَ تُحَرِّمُ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكَ تَبْتَغِى مَرْضَاتَ أَزْوَٰجِكَ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"O Messenger! Why do you make impermissible that which Allah has made permissible for you, i.e. making use of your servant girl Mariah, wanting to please your wives in doing so after they expressed protective jealousy over her? Allah is Forgiving towards you and is Merciful to you."
"Surely God has sanctioned the dissolution of your vows. God is your Lord: He is all-knowing, and all-wise.",1,66,قَدْ فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ تَحِلَّةَ أَيْمَٰنِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Verily, Allah has legislated for you to break your oaths by giving expiation if you find something better than the oaths your took or if you go against them. Allah is your helper and He is The Knower of your circumstances and what is best for you; He is The Wise in His legislation and decree."
"When the Prophet told one of his wives something in confidence and she disclosed it, God revealed this to him. So he made some of it known to her, and held back some. When, however, he informed her about it, she asked: ""Who told you this?"" He said: ""I was told this by the All-knowing, All-Informed.""",2,66,وَإِذْ أَسَرَّ ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِلَىٰ بَعْضِ أَزْوَٰجِهِۦ حَدِيثًا فَلَمَّا نَبَّأَتْ بِهِۦ وَأَظْهَرَهُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ عَرَّفَ بَعْضَهُۥ وَأَعْرَضَ عَنۢ بَعْضٍ فَلَمَّا نَبَّأَهَا بِهِۦ قَالَتْ مَنْ أَنۢبَأَكَ هَٰذَا قَالَ نَبَّأَنِىَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"And remember when the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned something only to Ḥafṣah, and that was that he will never again go close to his wife Mariah. So after Ḥafṣah informed ‘Ā’ishah of the information, and Allah informed His Messenger of his secret having been spread, he reprimanded Ḥafṣah and told her part of what she had said, not mentioning another. So she asked him, “Who informed you of this?” He replied, “The Knower of everything and The Aware of every hidden thing informed me of it.”"
"If both of you two (women) turn to God in penitence (it would be better). Your hearts have been impaired; and if you assist one another against him, then surely his helper is God, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and, besides them, the angels are his helpers.",3,66,إِن تَتُوبَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا وَإِن تَظَٰهَرَا عَلَيْهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ مَوْلَىٰهُ وَجِبْرِيلُ وَصَٰلِحُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ,"It is your duty that you both repent, because your hearts have inclined towards liking something the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) disliked, i.e. staying away from his servant girl and forbidding her upon himself. And if you insist upon joining forces against him, then know that Allah is his guardian and helper, and so is Gabriel and the best of believers. The angels are also his helpers and supporters after Allah against those who cause inconvenience to him."
"In case he divorces you, his Lord will give him better wives in return, who will be modest, true believers, obedient to God, repentant, observant of prayer and fasting, both widows and virgins.",4,66,عَسَىٰ رَبُّهُۥٓ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُۥٓ أَزْوَٰجًا خَيْرًا مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَٰتٍ مُّؤْمِنَٰتٍ قَٰنِتَٰتٍ تَٰٓئِبَٰتٍ عَٰبِدَٰتٍ سَٰٓئِحَٰتٍ ثَيِّبَٰتٍ وَأَبْكَارًا,"It is very likely that if His Messenger was to divorce both of you, Allah may He be glorified will give him wives better than you, who are submissive to his instructions, believing in Allah and His Messenger, obedient to Allah, repenting of their sins, devoted to their Lord, fasting; previously married and virgins whom no one except the Messenger has touched. However, he did not divorce them."
"O you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, over which are appointed angels stern and severe as wardens who never disobey what God commands them, and do what they are commanded;",5,66,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارًا وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ عَلَيْهَا مَلَٰٓئِكَةٌ غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ لَّا يَعْصُونَ ٱللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act according to what He has legislated for them! Put up a barrier for yourselves and your families against a huge fire which is stoked with people and stones. Appointed over this fire are tough angels who are harsh to whoever enters it. They do not disobey the command of Allah when He commands them, and they do whatever He commands them to do without hesitation or showing weakness."
"(And say:) ""O you who do not believe, make no excuses today. You will be requited only for what you had done.""",6,66,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَا تَعْتَذِرُوا۟ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"The disbelievers will be told on the day of resurrection: O you who have disbelieved in Allah! Do not make excuses today for the disbelief and sins you used to commit, because your excuses will not be accepted. Today, you will be requited only for the disbelief in Allah and rejection of His Messengers you used to perpetrate in the world."
"O you who believe, turn to God truly in repentance. Perhaps your Lord may forgive your ills and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by on the day when God will not humiliate the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will move in front of them and to their right, and they will say: ""O Lord, perfect our light and forgive us. You have power over every thing.""",7,66,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحًا عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ يَوْمَ لَا يُخْزِى ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِىَّ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مَعَهُۥ نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَىٰ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَٰنِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"O those who have faith in Allah and act according to what He has legislated for them! Repent to Allah sincerely for your sins; Allah will erase your sins from your records and enter you into gardens on the, under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, on the Day of Judgement: a day on which Allah will not humiliate the Prophet nor those who had faith with him, by entering them into the hellfire. Rather, their light will shine in front of them and their right sides on the Bridge, and they will be saying: “O our Lord! Perfect for us our light so that we can enter Paradise and not be like the hypocrites whose light dies out at the Bridge; and forgive our sins for us, because You are indeed, capable of everything. You are not incapable of perfecting our light and forgiving our sins.”"
"O Prophet, fight the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe with them. Their abode is Hell, an evil destination?",8,66,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ جَٰهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَأْوَىٰهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"O Messenger! Strive against the disbelievers with the sword, and against the hypocrites with your tongue and upholding the punishments. And be harsh against them so that they fear you. The abode they will end up in on the Day of Judgement is hell, and that abode is a very evil abode indeed."
"God advances the example of Noah's wife and the wife of Lot for those who do not believe. They were married to Our two pious devotees, but they were unfaithful to them, and even (the apostles) could not avail them in the least against God; and it was said to them: ""Enter Hell with those (who are condemned) to enter it.""",9,66,ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ٱمْرَأَتَ نُوحٍ وَٱمْرَأَتَ لُوطٍ كَانَتَا تَحْتَ عَبْدَيْنِ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا صَٰلِحَيْنِ فَخَانَتَاهُمَا فَلَمْ يُغْنِيَا عَنْهُمَا مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْـًٔا وَقِيلَ ٱدْخُلَا ٱلنَّارَ مَعَ ٱلدَّٰخِلِينَ,"Allah gives an example of those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger that their relationship with the believers will not benefit them in any condition: the example of the two wives of two of the prophets of Allah: the wives of Noah and Lot. For verily they were wives to two pious servants, but they deceived their husbands by preventing from the path of Allah and helping the people of disbelief from their nations. Their being wives of these two pious servants did not help them, and it will be said to them: “Enter into the hellfire amongst the disbelievers and transgressors entering it.”"
"And God presents the example of Pharaoh's wife for those who believe, when she said: ""O Lord, build me a house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds, and save me from a wicked people;""",10,66,وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلًا لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱمْرَأَتَ فِرْعَوْنَ إِذْ قَالَتْ رَبِّ ٱبْنِ لِى عِندَكَ بَيْتًا فِى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَنَجِّنِى مِن فِرْعَوْنَ وَعَمَلِهِۦ وَنَجِّنِى مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"And Allah also mentions an example to those who have faith in Him and His Messengers, that their connections with the disbelievers will not harm them or affect them as long as they remain steadfast upon the truth: the example of the wife of Pharaoh when she said: “O my Lord! Build a house for me near You in Paradise, and save me from the tyranny of Pharaoh, his might and his evil deeds; and save me also from the people who wrong themselves by following him in his transgression and oppression.”"
"And of Mary, daughter of 'Imran, who guarded her chastity, so that We breathed into her a new life from Us, and she believed the words of her Lord and His Books, and was among the obedient.",11,66,وَمَرْيَمَ ٱبْنَتَ عِمْرَٰنَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِنَا وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَٰتِ رَبِّهَا وَكُتُبِهِۦ وَكَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْقَٰنِتِينَ,"And Allah also mentions an example for those who have faith in Him and His Messengers, in the condition of Mary the daughter of ‘Imrān who safeguarded her private parts from fornication, so Allah commanded Gabriel to blow into her due to which she fell pregnant through the power of Allah with Jesus the son of Mary, without a father. She also believed in the religions of Allah and the books revealed to His Messengers, and she was obedient to Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He did not allow."
"BLESSED BE HE who holds the (reins of) Kingship in His hand, who has power over everything,",0,67,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ تَبَٰرَكَ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"The goodness of Allah who solely possesses the kingdom is great and abundant.

"Who created death and life in order to try you to see who of you are best of deed. He is all-mighty and forgiving,",1,67,ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفُورُ,"The one who created death and life to test you, O people, which one of you is better in terms of actions. He is the Almighty who no one can overpower; the Forgiving of the sins of whichever of His servants repents to him."
Who created the seven skies one above the other. Do you see any disproportion in the creations of Ar-Rahman? Turn your eyes again. Do you see any fissures?,2,67,ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ طِبَاقًا مَّا تَرَىٰ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَٰوُتٍ فَٱرْجِعِ ٱلْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍ,"The one who created the seven heavens, each one layered above the one before it without touching it. O observer! You will not witness any discrepancy or misappropriation in the creation of Allah. So look again, do you see cracks or splits? You will never see them; you will only see a perfect, masterful creation."
Turn your eyes again and again. Your gaze turns back dazed and tired.,3,67,ثُمَّ ٱرْجِعِ ٱلْبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْبَصَرُ خَاسِئًا وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ,"Then, look again time after time; your eyesight will return humiliated without having found any defect or fault in the creation of the heaven; exhausted without being able to see."
"We have adorned the lowest sky with lamps, and made them missiles against the devils, for whom We have prepared a torment of most intense fire.",4,67,وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"And verily I adorned the nearest sky to the earth with shining stars, making them shoot and repelling with them the satans with them who try to eavesdrop. I have also prepared for them a blazing fire in the afterlife."
For those who believe not in their Lord there is the punishment of Hell; and what a wretched destination,5,67,وَلِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"And for those who disbelieve in their Lord, on the Day of Judgement there is the punishment of a raging fire. Very evil is place they will return to."
"When they are cast into it, they will hear it roar and raging",6,67,إِذَآ أُلْقُوا۟ فِيهَا سَمِعُوا۟ لَهَا شَهِيقًا وَهِىَ تَفُورُ,"When they will be thrown into the hellfire, they will hear an extremely evil sound: it will be bubbling like a boiling pot."
"As though it would burst with fury. Every time a crowd is thrown into it, its wardens will ask: ""Did no warner come to you?""",7,67,تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ كُلَّمَآ أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ,"It almost bursts within itself and comes apart due to its extreme rage over those that are thrown into it. Each time a group is thrown into it from the disbelievers, the angels appointed over it will ask them scoldingly: “Did a Messenger not come to you in the world, warning you of the punishment of Allah?”"
"And they will answer: ""Surely; a warner came to us, but we denied him, and said: 'God did not send down any thing; you are greatly deluded, in fact.'""",8,67,قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَٰلٍ كَبِيرٍ,"The disbelievers will say, “Indeed! A Messenger did come to us warning us of the punishment of Allah but we rejected him, and we said to him, “Allah did not reveal any revelation. O Messengers! You are in nothing but clear deviance from the truth.””"
"They will say: ""If we had listened and been wise, we would not have been among the inmates of Hell.""",9,67,وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِىٓ أَصْحَٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"The disbelievers will say, “If we had listened attentively, or had thought clearly like the one who can differentiate the truth from falsehood, we would not have been amongst the people of the hellfire. Rather, we would have had faith in the Messengers and believed in whatever they brought, being from the people of Paradise.”"
So will they confess their guilt. Deprived (of all joys) will be the inmates of Hell.,10,67,فَٱعْتَرَفُوا۟ بِذَنۢبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لِّأَصْحَٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"So they will confess against themselves to having disbelieved and rejected, thereby being worthy of the hellfire. So away with the people of the hellfire!"
For those who fear their Lord in secret is forgiveness and a great reward.,11,67,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,"After Allah mentions the traits of the disbelievers and their requital, he follows it up with mentioning the qualities of the people of faith and their requital, saying: “Indeed, those who fear Allah in privacy, they will be forgiven for their sins and will get a great reward, i.e. Paradise.”"
"Whether you say a thing secretly or openly, He knows the innermost secrets of your hearts.",12,67,وَأَسِرُّوا۟ قَوْلَكُمْ أَوِ ٱجْهَرُوا۟ بِهِۦٓ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"O people! Speak secretively or openly; Allah hears it anyway. Indeed, He may He be glorified is aware of whatever is in the hearts of His servants; nothing is hidden from Him in that regard."
"Can He who has created not know (His creation)? He is all-penetrating, all-aware.",13,67,أَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَنْ خَلَقَ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,"Does the one who created all creation not know of the secret, and that which is more inconspicuous than the secret? He is The Kind to His servants; The Aware of their affairs. Nothing is hidden from Him in that regard."
"It is He who made the earth subservient to you that you may travel all around it, and eat of things He has provided; and to Him will be your resurrection.",14,67,هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ ذَلُولًا فَٱمْشُوا۟ فِى مَنَاكِبِهَا وَكُلُوا۟ مِن رِّزْقِهِۦ وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلنُّشُورُ,"He is the one who made the earth soft and easy for you to live on, so travel around to its edges and eat from the provision He has prepared for you within it. To Him alone you will be resurrected for accountability and requital."
"Are you so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not open up the earth to swallow you, when it will begin to tremble?",15,67,ءَأَمِنتُم مَّن فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَمُورُ,"Do you feel safe from the being in the heavens that He may cause the earth to split beneath you, just as He caused it to split beneath Korah, despite it having been soft and easy to live on? It could suddenly shake with you on it, after being firm and solid."
Or have you become so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not send a violent wind to shower stones at you? Then you will know the import of My commination!,16,67,أَمْ أَمِنتُم مَّن فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِبًا فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ,"Or do you feel safe from the being in the heavens that He could rain down stones upon you just like He did upon the people of Lot? Then you will realise, when you see My punishment for yourselves, My warnings to you. But you will never be able to benefit from them after having witnessed the punishment."
Those before them had also denied. And how was My punishment then!,17,67,وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,"Verily, the nations that came before these idolaters rejected, and so the punishment of Allah descended upon them after they insisted in their disbelief and rejection, so how was My disavowal of them? Verily, it was a severe disavowal."
Do they not see the birds above them flying wings spread out or folded? Nothing holds them aloft but God. All things are within His purview.,18,67,أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَى ٱلطَّيْرِ فَوْقَهُمْ صَٰٓفَّٰتٍ وَيَقْبِضْنَ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلَّا ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ إِنَّهُۥ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍۭ بَصِيرٌ,"Do these rejectors not see the birds above them flying in rows, side by side with one another? What stops them from falling to the ground, except Allah? Indeed, He is The Seeing of everything, nothing is hidden from Him."
What other army do you have to help you apart from Ar-Rahman? The unbelievers are surely lost in delusion.,19,67,أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى هُوَ جُندٌ لَّكُمْ يَنصُرُكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ إِنِ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ إِلَّا فِى غُرُورٍ,O disbelievers! There is no army that can save you from the punishment of Allah if He decides to punish you. The disbelievers are in nothing but deception; Satan has deceived them and they have fallen into his deception.
Who is there to give you food in case He withholds His bounty? Yet they persist in rebellion and aversion.,20,67,أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُۥ بَل لَّجُّوا۟ فِى عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ,"And there is no one that can sustain you if Allah stops His provisions from reaching you. Rather, the crux is that the disbelievers have prolonged in transgression, arrogance and refusal of the truth."
"Will he find the way who grovels flat on his face, or he who walks straight on the right path?",21,67,أَفَمَن يَمْشِى مُكِبًّا عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِۦٓ أَهْدَىٰٓ أَمَّن يَمْشِى سَوِيًّا عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"So is the one who walks while falling on his face i.e. the idolater more guided, or the believer who walks upright on the straight path?"
"Say: ""It is He who raised you and gave you ears and eyes and hearts. How little are the thanks you offer!""",22,67,قُلْ هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْأَبْصَٰرَ وَٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: “Allah is the one who created you and made for you ears through which you hear, eyes with which you see, and hearts through which you think. Little do you show gratitude to Him for the blessings He has conferred upon you."
"Say: ""It is He who dispersed you all over the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.""",23,67,قُلْ هُوَ ٱلَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject: “Allah is the one who dispersed you on earth and made you spread upon it, not your idols which cannot create anything. To Him alone you will be gathered on the Day of Judgement for accountability and requital, not your idols. So fear Him and worship Him alone."
"But they say: ""When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?""",24,67,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"And the rejectors of the resurrection, thinking it to be far-fetched, say, “O Muhammad! When will this promise that you and your companions promise us with, happen, if you are truthful in your claim that it will occur?”"
"Say: ""God alone has knowledge. My duty is only to warn you clearly.""",25,67,قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْعِلْمُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Say, O Messenger: “The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah; only He knows when it will occur. I am only a clear warner in my warning to you.”"
"When they realise it has come upon them, distraught will be the faces of unbelievers. They will be told: ""This is what you asked for.""",26,67,فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيٓـَٔتْ وُجُوهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَقِيلَ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى كُنتُم بِهِۦ تَدَّعُونَ,"So when the promise will come upon them and they will see the punishment close to them on the Day of Judgement, the faces of those who disbelieved in Allah will change and become dark. And it will be said to them, “This is what you used to ask for and want hastily!”"
"Say: ""Just think: If God destroys me and those with me, or is benevolent to us, who will then protect the unbelievers from a painful doom?""",27,67,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَهْلَكَنِىَ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن مَّعِىَ أَوْ رَحِمَنَا فَمَن يُجِيرُ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"O Messenger! Say to these rejecting idolaters, reprimanding them: “Tell me, if Allah was to case death to me and to those with me i.e. the believers, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?” No one will ever save them from it."
"Say: ""He is the benevolent; in Him do we believe, and in Him do we place our trust. You will now realise who is in manifest error.""",28,67,قُلْ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters: “He is The Merciful who invites you to worshipping Him alone. We have brought faith in Him, and upon Him alone we rely for our affairs. You will soon know, inevitably, who was in clear deviance and who was on the straight path.”"
"Say: ""Just think: If your water were to dry up in the morning who will bring you water from a fresh, flowing stream?""",29,67,قُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَصْبَحَ مَآؤُكُمْ غَوْرًا فَمَن يَأْتِيكُم بِمَآءٍ مَّعِينٍۭ,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters: “Tell me, if the water you drink from was to seep away into the earth and you could not get to it, who then would bring you abundant, flowing water?” No one other than Allah could."
"NUN. I CALL to witness the pen and what they inscribe,",0,68,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ نٓ وَٱلْقَلَمِ وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ,The discussion on similar letters has already passed in Sūrah Al-Baqarah. Allah takes an oath on the Pen and whatever the people write with their pens.
You are not demented by the grace of your Lord.,1,68,مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ,"O Messenger! You are not a madman, due to the messengership Allah has blessed you with. Rather, you are free of the insanity the idolaters accuse you with."
"There is surely reward unending for you,",2,68,وَإِنَّ لَكَ لَأَجْرًا غَيْرَ مَمْنُونٍ,"Indeed, there is definitely a great, everlasting reward for you for your conveying the message to the people, without there being a favour outstanding upon you for anyone."
For you are verily born of sublime nature.,3,68,وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ,"And indeed, you are definitely on the greatest of character that the Qur’ān has brought; you are embodied with it to the most perfect degree."
"So you will see, and they will realise,",4,68,فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ,"So you will soon see, and these rejectors will also see."
Who is distracted.,5,68,بِأَييِّكُمُ ٱلْمَفْتُونُ,"When the truth is revealed, who from amongst you was actually a madman."
"Verily your Lord knows those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows those who are guided on the way.",6,68,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"O Messenger! Indeed, your Lord knows of whoever deviates from His path, and He is best aware of those who are guided to it. Therefore, He knows that they are the ones who have deviated from it, and that you have been guided to it."
So do not comply with those who deny:,7,68,فَلَا تُطِعِ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"So, O Messenger, do not follow the rejectors in what you have brought."
"They only want that you should relent, so that they may come to terms.",8,68,وَدُّوا۟ لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ,"They wish that you were soft and compromising towards them in matters of religion, so they can be soft and kind to you in return."
"Do not heed a contemptible swearer,",9,68,وَلَا تُطِعْ كُلَّ حَلَّافٍ مَّهِينٍ,"And do not follow anyone who frequently takes false oaths, and is vulgar."
"Or backbiter, calumniator, slanderer,",10,68,هَمَّازٍ مَّشَّآءٍۭ بِنَمِيمٍ,"Who frequently backbites the people, and bears tales between them to cause division between them."
"Who hinders men from (doing) good, the transgressor, the iniquitous,",11,68,مَّنَّاعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ أَثِيمٍ,"Who often prevents goodness and oppresses the people in their wealth, their dignity and their lives; who is a habitual sinner and disobeyer."
"Crude, and above all, mean and infamous,",12,68,عُتُلٍّۭ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ زَنِيمٍ,"Who is stubborn and rude, one residing among his people without being related to them."
Simply because he possesses wealth and children.,13,68,أَن كَانَ ذَا مَالٍ وَبَنِينَ,"Just because he is a person of wealth and many sons, he is too arrogant to have faith in Allah and in His Messenger."
"When you recite Our revelations to him, he says: ""These are fables of long ago.""",14,68,إِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَٰتُنَا قَالَ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,"When My verses are read to him, he says, “This are the tales written of the people of the past.”"
We shall brand him on the muzzle.,15,68,سَنَسِمُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْخُرْطُومِ,I will place a mark on his nose which will stick with him and disfigure him.
We have tried you as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to gather the fruits in the morning,16,68,إِنَّا بَلَوْنَٰهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ إِذْ أَقْسَمُوا۟ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ,"Indeed, I have tested these idolaters with drought and hunger, just as I tested the people of the garden when they swore that they will quickly harvest its fruits in the morning, so that the poor cannot eat from them."
"But did not add: ""If God may please.""",17,68,وَلَا يَسْتَثْنُونَ,"They did not attribute the matter to Allah among themselves, by saying: “If Allah wills”."
"Then a calamity from your Lord fell upon it, but they remained fast asleep.",18,68,فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ,"So I sent a fire to the garden which consumed it while its owners were asleep, unable to defend it."
So by the morning it seemed as though picked clean.,19,68,فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَٱلصَّرِيمِ,"It became black, like a dark night."
At daybreak they called to each other:,20,68,فَتَنَادَوْا۟ مُصْبِحِينَ,"In the morning, its owners called on each other."
"""If you want to gather the fruits, let us go early to the plantation.""",21,68,أَنِ ٱغْدُوا۟ عَلَىٰ حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰرِمِينَ,"Saying, “Leave early towards your crop before the poor people arrive, if indeed, you wish to harvest your crops.”"
"So they departed, talking in low voices:",22,68,فَٱنطَلَقُوا۟ وَهُمْ يَتَخَٰفَتُونَ,"So they made their way towards their crop quickly, talking among themselves in hushed tones."
"""Let no needy person come to you within it today.""",23,68,أَن لَّا يَدْخُلَنَّهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُم مِّسْكِينٌ,They were saying to one another: “No poor person should come to you at the garden today.”
They left early in the morning bent on this purpose.,24,68,وَغَدَوْا۟ عَلَىٰ حَرْدٍ قَٰدِرِينَ,"They left in the early morning, determined not to let anyone get to their crops."
"When they saw (and did not recognise it) they said: ""Surely we have lost the way.",25,68,فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ,"Then, when they saw their crops having been burnt, they said to each other, “Surely, we have lost our way?!”"
"No. In fact we have been deprived of it.""",26,68,بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ,“Nay! We have been deprived of harvesting our crops because of us having been determined to prevent the poor from eating them.”
"One who was temperate among them, said: ""Did I not say: 'Why don't you priase God?'""",27,68,قَالَ أَوْسَطُهُمْ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ لَوْلَا تُسَبِّحُونَ,"The most virtuous among them said, “Did I not tell you when you made up your mind to prevent the poor from your crops: “Why do you not glorify Allah and repent to Him?””"
"""Glory to our Lord,"" they said; we were really in the wrong.""",28,68,قَالُوا۟ سُبْحَٰنَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"They said, “Glory be to our Lord; indeed, we wronged ourselves when we decided to prevent the poor from the crops of our garden.”"
"Then they started blaming one another,",29,68,فَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَلَٰوَمُونَ,So they began to go back on their words out of regret.
"Saying: ""Alas the woe, we were iniquitous.",30,68,قَالُوا۟ يَٰوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا طَٰغِينَ,"They said, regretfully, “How much we have lost! Indeed, we transgressed the limits by depriving the poor of their rights.”"
"Maybe our Lord will give us better than this. We turn to our Lord in supplication.""",31,68,عَسَىٰ رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَنَا خَيْرًا مِّنْهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا رَٰغِبُونَ,"“It is hoped from our Lord that He gives us better than our garden in return. Indeed, we are desirous towards Him; we hope for forgiveness from Him and seek goodness from Him.”"
"Such is Our chastisement; and the punishment of the Hereafter will be greater, if only they knew!",32,68,كَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ يَعْلَمُونَ,"I punish those who disobey Me just like I punished these people with the punishment of depravation. And indeed, the punishment of the afterlife is greater, if only they were to know its severity and permanence."
For those who fear God there are pleasure gardens with their Lord.,33,68,إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Indeed, those who are mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, will have gardens of pleasure by their Lord, wherein they will live in permanent luxury."
Should We treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable?,34,68,أَفَنَجْعَلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ كَٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Should I make the Muslims the same as the disbelievers in terms of requital, as the idolaters of Makkah claim?"
What has come upon you that you judge in such a wise?,35,68,مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,"O idolaters! What is wrong with you; how can you come to this oppressive, warped conclusion?"
Or have you a Book in which you read,36,68,أَمْ لَكُمْ كِتَٰبٌ فِيهِ تَدْرُسُونَ,Do you have a book in which you read that there should be equality between the obedient and disobedient?
That you can surely have whatever you choose?,37,68,إِنَّ لَكُمْ فِيهِ لَمَا تَخَيَّرُونَ,"Indeed, in that book you would then have whatever you choose in the afterlife."
"Or have you taken a binding promise from Us which would hold till the Day of Judgement, that you will get whatever you demand?",38,68,أَمْ لَكُمْ أَيْمَٰنٌ عَلَيْنَا بَٰلِغَةٌ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ لَمَا تَحْكُمُونَ,"Or, do you have covenants with Me weighted with oaths, that you will get whatever you decide for yourselves?"
"Ask them: ""Which of you is able to vouch for this?""",39,68,سَلْهُمْ أَيُّهُم بِذَٰلِكَ زَعِيمٌ,O Messenger! Ask those making these statement: “Who is their guarantor for this?”
"Or have they any partners? Let them bring their partners then, if what they say is true.",40,68,أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَآءُ فَلْيَأْتُوا۟ بِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ إِن كَانُوا۟ صَٰدِقِينَ,"Or do they have associates other than Allah who make them equal in requital with the believers? If so, they should bring forth these associates of theirs if they are true in their claim that they have made them equal in requital with the believers."
"On the day the great calamity befalls, and they are called to bow in homage, they will not be able to do so.",41,68,يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَن سَاقٍ وَيُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,"On the Day of Judgement, the horror will become clear and our Lord will expose a part of His Shin. The people will be invited to prostrate, so the believers will prostrate, but the disbelievers and hypocrites will remain standing, unable to prostrate."
"Lowered will be their eyes, disgrace overwhelming them. They had indeed been called to bow in homage when they were free of blame.",42,68,خَٰشِعَةً أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ وَقَدْ كَانُوا۟ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ وَهُمْ سَٰلِمُونَ,"Their eyesight will be humiliated; humiliation and regret will overcome them. Yet in the world, they were asked to prostrate to Allah while they were in safety from what they will be facing on that day."
So leave those who deny this Discourse to Me. We shall lead them step by step to (ruin) in a way they will not know.,43,68,فَذَرْنِى وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,"O Messenger! Leave me to deal with whoever denies this Qur’ān that has been revealed to you. I will drive them to the punishment gradually, in a way they do not realise that it is a method of leading them gradually into destruction."
Yet I will give them respite: Surely My plan is compact.,44,68,وَأُمْلِى لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ,"And I give them respite for a short while so that they go to extremes in their sin. Indeed, My plan regarding the people of disbelief and rejection is firm; they will not escape Me nor be safe from My punishment."
Do you ask for any compensation from them that they are burdened with want?,45,68,أَمْ تَسْـَٔلُهُمْ أَجْرًا فَهُم مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ,"O Messenger! Do you seek a reward from them for what you invite them towards, due to which they are greatly burdened, being the cause of their turning away from you? The reality is the opposite: you do not seek any reward from them; so what stops them from following you?"
Or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down?,46,68,أَمْ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ,"Or do they have knowledge of the Ghaib from which they write whatever proof appeal to them, that they then use to argue against you?"
"So wait with patience for the judgement of your Lord, and do not be like (onah) of the fish who called (to his Lord) when he was choked with anger.",47,68,فَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلَا تَكُن كَصَاحِبِ ٱلْحُوتِ إِذْ نَادَىٰ وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ,"O Messenger! So wait for the decision of your Lord to give them respite and gradually lead them into destruction. And do not be like the companion of the whale i.e. Jonah (peace be upon him) who became annoyed with his people, and then called out to his Lord while distressed in the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the stomach of the whale."
Had it not been for a favour from his Lord he would have been cast blame-worthy on a barren plain.,48,68,لَّوْلَآ أَن تَدَٰرَكَهُۥ نِعْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ لَنُبِذَ بِٱلْعَرَآءِ وَهُوَ مَذْمُومٌ,"Had it not been for the mercy of Allah reaching him, the whale would have thrown him on a barren land, rebuked."
Then his Lord chose him and placed him among the upright.,49,68,فَٱجْتَبَٰهُ رَبُّهُۥ فَجَعَلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,But his Lord chose him and made him one of His pious servants.
"But the unbelievers would like to stare you out of balance when they hear the warning, and say: ""Surely he is possessed;""",50,68,وَإِن يَكَادُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ لَمَّا سَمِعُوا۟ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُۥ لَمَجْنُونٌ,"And indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and reject his Messengers could almost bring you to the ground with their eyes due to their extremely sharp glances towards you when they hear this Qur’ān that was revealed to you. While following their desires and turning away from the truth, they say, “Indeed, the Messenger who has brought it is a madman.”"
Whilst it is no more than reminder for the people of the world.,51,68,وَمَا هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَٰلَمِينَ,Yet the Qur’ān that has been revealed to you is only a reminder and admonition for the humans and the Jinn.
THE CONCRETE REALITY.,0,69,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْحَآقَّةُ,Allah mentions the hour or resurrection that will occur on everyone.
What is the concrete reality?,1,69,مَا ٱلْحَآقَّةُ,Then He enhances its importance by asking this question: ‘What is al-Ḥāq-qah?’
What do you comprehend by the concrete reality?,2,69,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْحَآقَّةُ,Has anyone taught you about this al-Ḥāq-qah?
The Thamud and 'Ad denied the consequential calamity.,3,69,كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ وَعَادٌۢ بِٱلْقَارِعَةِ,"The Thamūd, the people of Saleh, and the ‘Ād, the people of Hud all denied the Day of Judgement that will strike the people with its severe horrors."
So destroyed were the Thamud by a storm of thunder and lightning;,4,69,فَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَأُهْلِكُوا۟ بِٱلطَّاغِيَةِ,"As for the Thamūd, Allah destroyed them with a scream that reached the height of severity and horror."
And the 'Ad were destroyed by the furious cold blast of roaring wind,5,69,وَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُوا۟ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ,"As for the ‘Ād, Allah destroyed them with a severely cold, relentless wind that reached the height of harshness upon them."
Which He sent to assail them for seven nights and eight days running. You should have seen the people prostrate like the decayed trunks of date-palm trees.,6,69,سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَٰنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُومًا فَتَرَى ٱلْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَىٰ كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ,"Allah released it upon them for seven nights and eight days, destroying them all. You would have seen the people destroyed in their homes, thrown onto the ground by the wind; as if they were the decomposed trunks of date palms fallen to the ground."
Do you see any trace of them?,7,69,فَهَلْ تَرَىٰ لَهُم مِّنۢ بَاقِيَةٍ,"Do you see anyone of them remaining, after the punishment that afflicted them?"
"Then came the Pharaoh, and those before him whose habitations were overthrown while they were committing crimes.",8,69,وَجَآءَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَن قَبْلَهُۥ وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَٰتُ بِٱلْخَاطِئَةِ,"Pharaoh and the nations before him, and the communities that were punished by being turned upside down i.e. the people of Lot, all committed wrong acts in ascribing partners with Allah and sins."
When they disobeyed the apostle of their Lord He seized them with an overwhelming punishment.,9,69,فَعَصَوْا۟ رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَهُمْ أَخْذَةً رَّابِيَةً,"Each of them disobeyed their Messengers who were sent to them and rejected them, so Allah seized them with a seizing that exceeded the force required to destroy them."
"When the water rose in flood, We bore you in the ark,",10,69,إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا ٱلْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَٰكُمْ فِى ٱلْجَارِيَةِ,"Indeed, when the water exceeded its limit in rising, I carried those of you who were in their backs on the ark that floated and which Noah (peace be upon him) built upon My command. So in effect, I carried you."
"In order to make it a warning for you, and that the ear retentive may preserve it.",11,69,لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَٰعِيَةٌ,"So that I could let the ark and its tale become a lesson through which proof of the destruction of the people of disbelief could be taken, together with the saving of the people of faith, and so attentive ears could take heed."
"When the single blast is sounded on the trumpet,",12,69,فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ نَفْخَةٌ وَٰحِدَةٌ,"So when the appointed angel will blow into the trumpet once, being the second blowing."
"And the earth and mountains heaved and crushed to powder with one levelling blow,",13,69,وَحُمِلَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَٰحِدَةً,"And the earth and mountains are raised, then crushed with one severe blow, the earth and its mountains will turn to pieces."
On that Day will come what is to come.,14,69,فَيَوْمَئِذٍ وَقَعَتِ ٱلْوَاقِعَةُ,"On the day when all that happens, the Day of Judgement will occur."
The sky will cleave asunder on that day and fall to pieces.,15,69,وَٱنشَقَّتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ فَهِىَ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاهِيَةٌ,"And the sky will crack open on that day because of the angels descending from it. So on that day it will be weak, whereas it was once solid and unyielding."
"On its fringes will be angels, eight of them, bearing their Lord's throne aloft.",16,69,وَٱلْمَلَكُ عَلَىٰٓ أَرْجَآئِهَا وَيَحْمِلُ عَرْشَ رَبِّكَ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ ثَمَٰنِيَةٌ,The angels will be on its edges and corners. Eight elite angels will carry the throne of your Lord on that great day.
"You will then be set before Him, and not one of you will remain unexposed.",17,69,يَوْمَئِذٍ تُعْرَضُونَ لَا تَخْفَىٰ مِنكُمْ خَافِيَةٌ,"O people! On that Day, you will be exhibited for judgemen]; not hidden among you is anything concealed, rather Allah will be fully aware and watchful of it."
"He who is given his ledger in his right hand, will say: ""Here, read my ledger.",18,69,فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَٰبَهُۥ بِيَمِينِهِۦ فَيَقُولُ هَآؤُمُ ٱقْرَءُوا۟ كِتَٰبِيَهْ,"As for the one who is given his book of deeds in his right hand, he will say out of happiness and delight, “Take and read my book of deeds!”"
"I was certain I'll be given my account.""",19,69,إِنِّى ظَنَنتُ أَنِّى مُلَٰقٍ حِسَابِيَهْ,"“Indeed, I did good deeds in the world and was convinced of being resurrected and having to meet my reward.”"
So he shall have an agreeable life,20,69,فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ,So he will be living in a contented manner because of seeing the everlasting favours.
In high empyrean,21,69,فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ,In a Paradise elevated in position and rank.
"With fruits hanging low within reach,",22,69,قُطُوفُهَا دَانِيَةٌ,The fruits of which will be near to those intending to consume them.
"(And told:) ""Eat and drink to your fill as reward for (good) deeds you had done in days of yore.""",23,69,كُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ هَنِيٓـًٔۢا بِمَآ أَسْلَفْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَيَّامِ ٱلْخَالِيَةِ,"It will be said to them in hospitality, “Eat and drink carefree of any ill repercussions due to the good deeds you sent forth in the days passed in the world.”"
"But whosoever gets his ledger in his left hand, will say: ""Would that I were never given my ledger,",24,69,وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَٰبَهُۥ بِشِمَالِهِۦ فَيَقُولُ يَٰلَيْتَنِى لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَٰبِيَهْ,"As for the one who will be given his book of deeds in his left hand, he will say out of extreme regret, “If only I had not been given my book of deeds, because of the evil deeds deserving punishment within it.”"
And not known my account!,25,69,وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ,“And if only I did not know what the result of my giving account was.”
I wish death had put an end to me.,26,69,يَٰلَيْتَهَا كَانَتِ ٱلْقَاضِيَةَ,"“If only the death I died, was the final one after which I was never resurrected.”"
Of no use was even my wealth.,27,69,مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنِّى مَالِيَهْ,“My wealth did not protect me at all from the punishment of Allah.”
"Vanished has my power from me.""",28,69,هَلَكَ عَنِّى سُلْطَٰنِيَهْ,"“My evidence has deserted me, as well as all the strength and dignity.”"
"""Seize him and manacle him,",29,69,خُذُوهُ فَغُلُّوهُ,"And it will be said, “O angels! Grab him and gather his hands at his neck.”"
Then cast him to be burnt in Hell;,30,69,ثُمَّ ٱلْجَحِيمَ صَلُّوهُ,“Then enter him into the hellfire so that he sees its heat.”
And string him to a chain seventy cubits long.,31,69,ثُمَّ فِى سِلْسِلَةٍ ذَرْعُهَا سَبْعُونَ ذِرَاعًا فَٱسْلُكُوهُ,“Then chain him up with a chain measuring seventy cubits in length.”
"He did not believe in God the supreme,",32,69,إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"“Indeed, he would not believe in Allah the Great.”"
Nor urged others to feed the poor.,33,69,وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ ٱلْمِسْكِينِ,“Neither would he encourage others to feed the poor.”
"That is why he has no friend today,",34,69,فَلَيْسَ لَهُ ٱلْيَوْمَ هَٰهُنَا حَمِيمٌ,"So on the Day of Judgement, he will have no relative to save him from the punishment."
Nor food other than suppuration (filth),35,69,وَلَا طَعَامٌ إِلَّا مِنْ غِسْلِينٍ,Neither will he have any food to eat except the fluid flowing from the bodies of the people of the hellfire.
"Which none but the hellish eat.""",36,69,لَّا يَأْكُلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱلْخَٰطِـُٔونَ,Only the sinners will eat from that food.

"And what you do not see,",38,69,وَمَا لَا تُبْصِرُونَ,And He also takes an oath on whatever you cannot see.
"That this is indeed the word of the noble Messenger,",39,69,إِنَّهُۥ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ,"That indeed, the Qur’ān is the speech of Allah, which His noble Messenger recites to the people."
And not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe!,40,69,وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلًا مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ,It is not the speech of a poet because it is not on the pattern of a poem; little do you believe!
Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little is it that you reflect!,41,69,وَلَا بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ,Neither is it the speech of a fortune teller because the speech of fortune tellers is different to that of this Qur’ān; little do you take heed!
It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.,42,69,تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Rather, it is a revelation from the Lord of all creation."
"Had he attributed falsely any words to Us,",43,69,وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلْأَقَاوِيلِ,"And if Muhammad was to fabricate lies and attribute them to Me, which I had not said."

And not one of you would have been able to stop (Us).,46,69,فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَٰجِزِينَ,"But none of you can protect him from Me, so it is far-fetched that he fabricates lies because of you."
It is really a reminder for those who fear God and follow the straight path.,47,69,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَتَذْكِرَةٌ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"And indeed, the Qur’ān is an admonition for those who are mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed."
We certainly know that some among you do deny it.,48,69,وَإِنَّا لَنَعْلَمُ أَنَّ مِنكُم مُّكَذِّبِينَ,And I know that there are definitely people among you who reject this Qur’ān.
It is surely the nemesis of unbelievers.,49,69,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَحَسْرَةٌ عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"Indeed, rejection of this Qur’ān will be a means of great regret on the Day of Judgement."
"And He, He is indeed the ultimate Reality.",50,69,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَحَقُّ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"Indeed, the Qur’ān is the certain truth: there is no doubt and dispute that it is from Allah."
"So glorify your Lord, the most supreme.",51,69,فَسَبِّحْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"O Messenger! So proclaim the purity of you Lord of whatever is not befitting of Him, and remember His great name."
AN INQUIRER ASKED for the affliction that is to come,0,70,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ سَأَلَ سَآئِلٌۢ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ,"A caller from the idolaters called for the punishment upon himself and his people if this punishment was to actually come. It was a mockery on his part, but it will happen on the Day of Judgement."
Upon the infidels -- which none would be able to repel --,1,70,لِّلْكَٰفِرِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ دَافِعٌ,It will fall upon the disbelievers in Allah. There will be no one to avert this punishment.
"From God, the Lord of the steps (of progression),",2,70,مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذِى ٱلْمَعَارِجِ,"From Allah the possessor of highness, ranks, virtues and favours."
"To whom the angels and the soul take a day to ascend, whose length is fifty thousand years.",3,70,تَعْرُجُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَٱلرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُۥ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ,The angels and Gabriel will ascend in them ranks on the Day of Judgement: it is a day of which the duration is fifty thousand years.
So persevere with becoming patience.,4,70,فَٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا,O Messenger! So be patient; a patience free of worry and complaint.
"They surely take it to be far away,",5,70,إِنَّهُمْ يَرَوْنَهُۥ بَعِيدًا,"Indeed, they think of this punishment to be farfetched and impossible."
But We see it very near.,6,70,وَنَرَىٰهُ قَرِيبًا,But I see it as being near and inevitably occurring.
"The day the sky becomes like molten brass,",7,70,يَوْمَ تَكُونُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ كَٱلْمُهْلِ,"On the day when the sky will be like molten copper, gold and other metals."
"The mountains like the tufts of (carded) wool,",8,70,وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ,"And the mountains will be light, like cotton."
And no friend inquires after friend,9,70,وَلَا يَسْـَٔلُ حَمِيمٌ حَمِيمًا,"No relative will ask another regarding his state, because each person will be preoccupied with his own self."
"Though within sight of one another. The sinner would like to ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his sons,",10,70,يُبَصَّرُونَهُمْ يَوَدُّ ٱلْمُجْرِمُ لَوْ يَفْتَدِى مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمِئِذٍۭ بِبَنِيهِ,"Each human will see their relatives clearly, yet despite that no one will ask another due to the horror of the scenario. The one deserving of the hellfire will wish to present his children to the punishment instead of himself."
"His wife and his brother,",11,70,وَصَٰحِبَتِهِۦ وَأَخِيهِ,Or give his wife and brother in ransom.
"And his family who had stood by him,",12,70,وَفَصِيلَتِهِ ٱلَّتِى تُـْٔوِيهِ,Or his closest relatives who would stand with him in the face of difficulties.
"And all those who are on the earth, to save himself.",13,70,وَمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ يُنجِيهِ,"And he will wish to give every human and Jinn on earth in ransom, wishing that it would save him from the punishment of the hellfire."
But never. It is pure white flame,14,70,كَلَّآ إِنَّهَا لَظَىٰ,"It will not be as this criminal will wish for. Indeed, it is the fire of the afterlife which blazes and flares up."
That would skin the scalp.,15,70,نَزَّاعَةً لِّلشَّوَىٰ,"Due to its extreme heat and flares, the skin of the head will come clean apart."
"It will summon whoever turns his back and flees,",16,70,تَدْعُوا۟ مَنْ أَدْبَرَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,"It will call out to whoever turned away from the truth, distanced himself from it, did not bring faith in it nor acted upon it."
Who amasses and then hoards.,17,70,وَجَمَعَ فَأَوْعَىٰٓ,"And whoever amassed wealth, withholding from spending it in the path of Allah."
Surely man is greedy by nature.,18,70,إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ خُلِقَ هَلُوعًا,"Indeed, man has been created extremely greedy."

In whose wealth a due share is included,23,70,وَٱلَّذِينَ فِىٓ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ حَقٌّ مَّعْلُومٌ,"And those who have a set, determined amount of their wealth."
"For the needy and those dispossessed,",24,70,لِّلسَّآئِلِ وَٱلْمَحْرُومِ,"Which they give to whoever asks them or doesn’t, but are deprived of sustenance for whatever reason."

"Are free of blame,",29,70,إِلَّا عَلَىٰٓ أَزْوَٰجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ,"Except from their wives or the servant girls they possess, because they are not blameworthy in enjoying them through sexual intercourse or anything less."
But those who seek more than this will be transgressors;,30,70,فَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَىٰ وَرَآءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْعَادُونَ,"Whoever seeks pleasure in other than whatever has been mentioned i.e. wives and servant girls, they are the ones who have transgressed the limits of Allah."
"And those who fulfil their trusts and covenants,",31,70,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَٰنَٰتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَٰعُونَ,"And those who, when entrusted with wealth, secrets etc., or with agreements they enter into, they uphold them: neither betraying their trusts nor breaking their agreements."
"Who uphold their testimonies,",32,70,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِشَهَٰدَٰتِهِمْ قَآئِمُونَ,"And those who give their testimonies in the manner sought from them, without being affected by relationships or enmity."
And those who are mindful of their moral obligations.,33,70,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ,"And those who are punctual in their prayers by performing them at their appropriate times, with due purity and composure, whilst not being distracted from them by anything."
They will live in gardens with honour.,34,70,أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ فِى جَنَّٰتٍ مُّكْرَمُونَ,"Those possessing the aforementioned qualities will be honoured in gardens, attaining everlasting favours and being able to see the blessed Face of Allah."
What is the matter with unbelievers that they stare at you with fixed gazes and hasten towards you,35,70,فَمَالِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ قِبَلَكَ مُهْطِعِينَ,O Messenger! What is it that has led these idolaters around you to reject you so quickly?
"In crowds, right and left?",36,70,عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ ٱلشِّمَالِ عِزِينَ,"Surrounding you from your right and left, in groups upon groups."
Does every one of them wish to enter the garden of tranquility?,37,70,أَيَطْمَعُ كُلُّ ٱمْرِئٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُدْخَلَ جَنَّةَ نَعِيمٍ,"Do each of them hope that Allah will enter them into the garden of favours, wherein they shall live in luxury among the everlasting bounties, while they remain on their disbelief?"
Never so. We have created them from what they know.,38,70,كَلَّآ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَٰهُم مِّمَّا يَعْلَمُونَ,"It is not as they imagine. Indeed, I created them from what they know: I created them from a contemptible fluid, and they are weak: they are incapable of bringing benefit or harm for themselves, so how could they be arrogant?"
So I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are certainly able,39,70,فَلَآ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْمَشَٰرِقِ وَٱلْمَغَٰرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَٰدِرُونَ,"Allah takes an oath on the Lord of the rising places of the sun and the moon. Indeed, Allah is the Capable."
To bring better people than they in their place; and they will not be able to thwart Us.,40,70,عَلَىٰٓ أَن نُّبَدِّلَ خَيْرًا مِّنْهُمْ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَسْبُوقِينَ,He is capable of destroying them and replacing them with others who obey Him; He is not incapable of doing so. Nor can He be overpowered when He intends to destroy them and replace them.
"So leave them to their vain disputes and amusement till they meet their day (of reckoning) promised them,",41,70,فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُوا۟ وَيَلْعَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ يُلَٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ,"O Messenger! So leave them to dive into the falsehood and deviance they are already in, and to amuse themselves in their worldly lives, until they encounter the Day of Judgement that they have been promised in the Qur’ān."
"The day when they will come out of their graves in all haste as though rushing to their altars,",42,70,يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ ٱلْأَجْدَاثِ سِرَاعًا كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ,"On the day when they shall leave their graves in a hurry, as if they are racing towards a banner."
"Eyes lowered, shame attending. That is the day they have been promised!",43,70,خَٰشِعَةً أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمُ ٱلَّذِى كَانُوا۟ يُوعَدُونَ,"Their eyes will be humiliated, and humiliation will envelop them. That is the day they were promised in the world, but they did not care about it."
SENT NOAH to his people to warn them before the painful punishment came upon them.,0,71,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦٓ أَنْ أَنذِرْ قَوْمَكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Indeed, I sent Noah to his people, inviting them so that he may warn them before a painful punishment afflicts them due to their state of ascribing partners to Allah."
"He said: ""O my people, I warn you clearly",1,71,قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنِّى لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"Noah said to his people, “O my people! Indeed, I am a clear warner for you of the punishment of Allah that awaits you if you do not repent to Him.”"
"That you should worship God and fear Him, and follow me",2,71,أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَأَطِيعُونِ,"“And the gist of my warning to you is: “Worship Allah alone and do not ascribe any partners to Him; be mindful of Him by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, and obey me in whatever I instruct you to do.”"
"That He may forgive some of your sins and prolong your term till an appointed time. Surely when God's appointed time is come it will not be put off, if only you knew!",3,71,يَغْفِرْ لَكُم مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُؤَخِّرْكُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى إِنَّ أَجَلَ ٱللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لَا يُؤَخَّرُ لَوْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"“Indeed, if you do that, Allah will forgive your sins for you in relation to other than violating the rights of the people. He will also prolong the lifespan of your nations until a time fixed according to His knowledge, wherein you shall populate the earth as long as you remain steadfast on it. Indeed, when death comes, it does not delay. If you truly knew, you would hasten to bringing faith in Allah and repenting to Him from your states of ascribing partners to Him and of deviance.”"
"He said: ""O Lord, I called my people night and day,",4,71,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى دَعَوْتُ قَوْمِى لَيْلًا وَنَهَارًا,"Noah said, “O my Lord! Indeed, I called my people to Your worship and oneness, continuously, day and night.”"
"But the more I called, they only ran the farther away.",5,71,فَلَمْ يَزِدْهُمْ دُعَآءِىٓ إِلَّا فِرَارًا,“But my calling them only increased them in alienation and distanced them from what I called them towards.”
"And every time I called them that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and covered themselves with their garments, and became wayward, and behaved with downright insolence.",6,71,وَإِنِّى كُلَّمَا دَعَوْتُهُمْ لِتَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ جَعَلُوٓا۟ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَٱسْتَغْشَوْا۟ ثِيَابَهُمْ وَأَصَرُّوا۟ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ ٱسْتِكْبَارًا,"“And whenever I called them towards that which meant forgiveness for their sins, i.e. worshipping You alone, obedience to You and Your Messenger, they blocked their ears with their fingers so that they could not hear my call. They also covered their faces with their clothes so that they could not see me, and they continued in their ascribing partners to you, showing arrogance in not accepting my call to them or submitting to it.”"
"Then I called them loudly and more openly,",7,71,ثُمَّ إِنِّى دَعَوْتُهُمْ جِهَارًا,“O my Lord! I then invited them publicly.”
"And declared to them in public and in private,",8,71,ثُمَّ إِنِّىٓ أَعْلَنتُ لَهُمْ وَأَسْرَرْتُ لَهُمْ إِسْرَارًا,"“I invited them raising my voice, and I also invited them privately in a hushed tone. I used different methods of calling them.”"
And I told them: 'Ask your Lord to forgive you. He is verily forgiving.,9,71,فَقُلْتُ ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفَّارًا,"Then I said to them, “O my people! Seek the forgiveness of your Lord by turning to Him. Indeed, He, may He be glorified, is the oft-Forgiving of the sins of whichever of His servants repents to Him.”"
"He will send you abundant rain from the sky,",10,71,يُرْسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَارًا,"“Because if you do that, Allah will send down frequent rainfall for you, whenever you need it, so you will never face a drought.”"
"And will give you increase of wealth and sons, and give you gardens and springs of water.",11,71,وَيُمْدِدْكُم بِأَمْوَٰلٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَٰرًا,"“And He will grant you an abundance of wealth and offspring, make gardens grow for you from which you can consume fruits, and make rivers flow from which you can drink and irrigate your crops and livestock.”"
"What has come upon you that you do not fear the majesty of God,",12,71,مَّا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلَّهِ وَقَارًا,"“O my people! What is wrong with you that you do not fear the greatness of Allah, such that you disobey Him without any care?!”"
Knowing that He has created you by various stages?,13,71,وَقَدْ خَلَقَكُمْ أَطْوَارًا,"“While He created you in stages, one after the other: a drop of semen, then clotted blood, then a piece of flesh.”"
"Do you not see how God has fashioned seven skies one above the other,",14,71,أَلَمْ تَرَوْا۟ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ طِبَاقًا,"“Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one on top of the other?”"
"And has placed the moon therein, an illumination, and has placed the sun, a lighted lamp?",15,71,وَجَعَلَ ٱلْقَمَرَ فِيهِنَّ نُورًا وَجَعَلَ ٱلشَّمْسَ سِرَاجًا,"“And He made the moon a light for the people of the earth, in the nearest of the heavens, also making the sun illuminating.”"
God produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth;,16,71,وَٱللَّهُ أَنۢبَتَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا,"“And Allah is the one who created you from the earth, by creating your father Adam from soil. Then, you are also nourished by whatever it grows for you.”"
"He will then return you back to it, and bring you out again.",17,71,ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا,"“Allah will then return you to it after your death, and then take you out of it again for the resurrection.”"
"God has made the earth for you a spreading,",18,71,وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ بِسَاطًا,"“And Allah also spread the earth out for you, ready for you to live on.”"
So that you may walk upon its spacious paths.',19,71,لِّتَسْلُكُوا۟ مِنْهَا سُبُلًا فِجَاجًا,"“Perhaps you may create wide paths from it, striving to make permissible earnings.”"
"But they did not listen to me,"" Noah said, ""and followed him whose wealth and children only added to his ruin.",20,71,قَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ إِنَّهُمْ عَصَوْنِى وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَن لَّمْ يَزِدْهُ مَالُهُۥ وَوَلَدُهُۥٓ إِلَّا خَسَارًا,"Noah said, “O my Lord! Indeed, my people have disobeyed me in what I have instructed them to do i.e. accepting Your oneness and worshipping You alone. The lowly among them have followed the nobles, whom You have favoured with wealth and offspring. Your favouring them has only increased them in their deviance.”"
"And they contrived a plot of great magnitude,",21,71,وَمَكَرُوا۟ مَكْرًا كُبَّارًا,The elders among them hatched a great plot by inciting the lowly against Noah.
"And said: 'Do not abandon your gods, and do not abandon Wadda or Suwa', or Yaghuth, Ya'uq or Nasr.'",22,71,وَقَالُوا۟ لَا تَذَرُنَّ ءَالِهَتَكُمْ وَلَا تَذَرُنَّ وَدًّا وَلَا سُوَاعًا وَلَا يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْرًا,"They said to their followers, “Do not leave the worship of your deities: do not leave the worship of your idols Wadd, Suwā‘, Yaghūth and Nasr.”"
And they misled many. So do not give the evil-doers increase but in error.,23,71,وَقَدْ أَضَلُّوا۟ كَثِيرًا وَلَا تَزِدِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ إِلَّا ضَلَٰلًا,"“Verily, they have led the majority of people astray with these idols. O my Lord! Do not increase those who wrong themselves by persisting on disbelief and sins, except in further deviance from the truth.”"
"They were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness, and sent to Hell, and did not find any helper other than God.",24,71,مِّمَّا خَطِيٓـَٰٔتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُوا۟ فَأُدْخِلُوا۟ نَارًا فَلَمْ يَجِدُوا۟ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَنصَارًا,"Due to the sins they committed, they were drowned by a flood in the world, and they were made to enter the hellfire immediately after their death. They did not find any helpers to save them from drowning or the hellfire."
"Noah said: ""O Lord, do not leave a single habitation of unbelievers on the earth.",25,71,وَقَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ لَا تَذَرْ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ دَيَّارًا,"And when Allah informed him that no one will ever bring faith from his people, except those had already brought faith, Noah said, “O my Lord! Do not leave any disbeliever walking or moving on earth.”"
"If you leave them, they will lead Your creatures astray, and beget but iniquitous and ungrateful offspring.",26,71,إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّوا۟ عِبَادَكَ وَلَا يَلِدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا فَاجِرًا كَفَّارًا,"“O my Lord! If you leave them and give them respite, they will lead your believing servants astray and will only give birth to more transgressors who will not obey You, or extreme ungrateful ones who will not show gratitude for Your favours.”"
"O Lord, forgive me, my parents, and any one who enters my house as a believer, and all believing men and women, and do not give the evil-doers increase save in ruin.",27,71,رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَٰلِدَىَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيْتِىَ مُؤْمِنًا وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَلَا تَزِدِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ إِلَّا تَبَارًۢا,"“O my Lord! Forgive my sins, forgive my parents, and forgive the one who enters my house as a believer. Also forgive the believing men and women, and do not increase those who wrong themselves by disbelief and sins except in destruction and loss.”"
"SAY: ""I HAVE been informed that a number of jinns had listened; then said: 'We have heard the wondrous Qur'an,",0,72,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ ٱسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانًا عَجَبًا,"Say, O Messenger, to your nation: Allah revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened to my recitation of the Qur’ān in Batn Nakhla. When they went back to their people they said to them: We have heard a recited speech that is impressive in its clarity and eloquence."
"Which guides to the right path; and we have come to believe in it, and will not associate any one with our Lord.",1,72,يَهْدِىٓ إِلَى ٱلرُّشْدِ فَـَٔامَنَّا بِهِۦ وَلَن نُّشْرِكَ بِرَبِّنَآ أَحَدًا,"This speech that we heard guides to the correct belief, statements and actions, so we believed in it and we will not associate any partner with our Lord Who revealed it."
Exalted is the glory of our Lord; He has neither wife nor son.,2,72,وَأَنَّهُۥ تَعَٰلَىٰ جَدُّ رَبِّنَا مَا ٱتَّخَذَ صَٰحِبَةً وَلَا وَلَدًا,We have believed that He - exalted be the grandeur and majesty of our Lord - has not taken any wife nor child as the idolaters say.
Certainly the foolish among us say preposterous things of God.,3,72,وَأَنَّهُۥ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ شَطَطًا,"And that Iblis made an errant statement about Allah by attributing a wife and child to Him, may He be glorified."
"We had in fact thought that men and jinns would never speak a lie about God,",4,72,وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن تَقُولَ ٱلْإِنسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا,"And that we thought that the idolaters from among mankind and the jinn were not speaking lies when they claimed that He had a wife and child, so we accepted their statement blindly following them."
"But some men used to seek refuge with some jinns, and this increased their waywardness;",5,72,وَأَنَّهُۥ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ ٱلْإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقًا,"And that in the period of ignorance, some men from mankind used to seek protection in the jinn when they came to a frightening place. One of them would say: I seek protection in the leader of this valley from the evil of the foolish ones of his people. As a result, human beings became more afraid and terrified of the jinn."
"So they began to think, even as you do, that God would not resurrect any one.",6,72,وَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّوا۟ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدًا,"And that humans thought as you did, O jinn, that Allah will not resurrect anyone after his death for the reckoning and recompense."
"We sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens, but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames.",7,72,وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ فَوَجَدْنَٰهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَسًا شَدِيدًا وَشُهُبًا,"And that we sought the news of the heaven and we found the sky full of stern guards, who were the angels, who guarded it from the eavesdropping that we used to do, and full of flaming fires thrown at everyone who comes close to the sky."
We sat in observatories to listen; but any one who listened found a shooting star in wait for him.,8,72,وَأَنَّا كُنَّا نَقْعُدُ مِنْهَا مَقَٰعِدَ لِلسَّمْعِ فَمَن يَسْتَمِعِ ٱلْءَانَ يَجِدْ لَهُۥ شِهَابًا رَّصَدًا,"And that we in the past used to assume positions in the sky from where we could hear what the angels were deliberating, and then we would convey this to the fortune-tellers on earth. Now things have changed. Anyone of us who now tries to listen finds a flaming fire ready for him. When he goes near, it is released on him and he is burnt by it."
"We do not know if this means ill for the dwellers of the earth, or their Lord wishes guidance for them.",9,72,وَأَنَّا لَا نَدْرِىٓ أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَدًا,"And that we do not know what is the cause of this stern guard, is it that evil is intended for those on earth, or does Allah intend good for them. News of the sky has been cut off from us."
For some of us are upright and some otherwise: Surely we follow different ways.,10,72,وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلصَّٰلِحُونَ وَمِنَّا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ كُنَّا طَرَآئِقَ قِدَدًا,And that we - the group of jinn-: some of us are Allah-conscious and righteous whilst some of us are disbelievers and sinners. We are of different types and of diverse persuasions.
"We realised that we could not weaken the power of God on earth, nor outpace Him by running away.",11,72,وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن نُّعْجِزَ ٱللَّهَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَن نُّعْجِزَهُۥ هَرَبًا,"And that we are certain that we cannot escape Allah, may He be glorified, when He intends some matter for us. We will never be able to escape Him by fleeing because He surrounds us."
So when we heard the guidance we believed in it; and he who believes in his Lord will neither fear loss nor force.,12,72,وَأَنَّا لَمَّا سَمِعْنَا ٱلْهُدَىٰٓ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ فَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ بِرَبِّهِۦ فَلَا يَخَافُ بَخْسًا وَلَا رَهَقًا,And that when we heard the Qur’ān that guides to what is most upright we had faith in it. Whoever has faith in his Lord will not fear any loss of his good deeds and nor any sin that will be added to his prior sins.
"Some of us have come to submission, and some of us are iniquitous.'"" Those who have submitted have taken the right course;",13,72,وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا ٱلْقَٰسِطُونَ فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ تَحَرَّوْا۟ رَشَدًا,"And that some of us submit and follow Allah by obeying Him, and some of us go astray from the path of moderation and steadfastness. Those who submit to Allah by following him and doing righteous actions, they are the ones who have sought after guidance and the right way."
But those who are iniquitous will be fuel for Hell.,14,72,وَأَمَّا ٱلْقَٰسِطُونَ فَكَانُوا۟ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَبًا,"Those who go astray from the path of moderation and steadfastness, they will be firewood that will be used to light the fire of Hell together with other human beings like them."
"(Say): ""If they keep to the right path We shall give them water in abundance to drink",15,72,وَأَلَّوِ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلطَّرِيقَةِ لَأَسْقَيْنَٰهُم مَّآءً غَدَقًا,"Just as I revealed to him that a group of the jinn listened to him, I revealed to him that if human beings and the jinn remained steadfast on the path of Islam, and practiced on what it contained, then Allah would have given them plenty water to drink and provided them with various blessings."
"In order to try them through it. But whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, will be given increasing torment by Him.""",16,72,لِّنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَمَن يُعْرِضْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِۦ يَسْلُكْهُ عَذَابًا صَعَدًا,"To test them in that, are they thankful for Allah’s favours or are they ungrateful for them? Whoever turns away from the Qur’ān and the admonitions it contains, His Lord will enter him into a difficult punishment that he will not be able to bear."
All places of worship are for God; so do not invoke any one with God.,17,72,وَأَنَّ ٱلْمَسَٰجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ أَحَدًا,And that the mosques belong to Him (may He be glorified) and not to anyone else. So do not call on anyone together with Allah and become like the Jews and the Christians in their synagogues and churches.
When the devotee of God stood up to invoke Him (the jinns) crowded upon him (to listen).,18,72,وَأَنَّهُۥ لَمَّا قَامَ عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُوا۟ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَدًا,"And that when Allah’s servant, Muhammad (peace be on him) stood up to worship His Lord in Batn Nakhla, the jinn were almost piled on top of him because of the huge crowd when they heard him reciting the Qur’ān."
"Say: ""I call on my Lord alone and I do not associate any one with Him.""",19,72,قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَدْعُوا۟ رَبِّى وَلَآ أُشْرِكُ بِهِۦٓ أَحَدًا,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters: I only call unto my Lord alone and I do not associate anyone else as partner to Him in worship, whoever he may be."
"Say: ""Neither is your loss within my power nor bringing you to guidance.""",20,72,قُلْ إِنِّى لَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا رَشَدًا,"Say to them: I do not have any power to ward off any harm that Allah has decreed for you, nor do I have any power to draw any benefit that Allah has withheld from you."
"Say: ""No one can save me from God, nor can I find a place of refuge apart from Him,",21,72,قُلْ إِنِّى لَن يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ ٱللَّهِ أَحَدٌ وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مُلْتَحَدًا,"Say to them: No one can save me from Allah if I go against Him, and I will never find any place of refuge to take refuge in besides Him."
"Unless I convey from God and deliver His message."" For those who disobey God and His Apostle is the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever;",22,72,إِلَّا بَلَٰغًا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِسَٰلَٰتِهِۦ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ فَإِنَّ لَهُۥ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا,"But that which is in my power is to convey to you what Allah has instructed me to convey to you, and His message that He sent with me to you. Whoever goes against Allah and His messenger, his fate is entry into the fire of Hell to remain their forever and never come out."
"Until they see what they are promised, when they will understand who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers.",23,72,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا رَأَوْا۟ مَا يُوعَدُونَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَضْعَفُ نَاصِرًا وَأَقَلُّ عَدَدًا,"The disbelievers will persist in their disbelief until when they see on the day of judgment the punishment that they were warned of in the world. At that time, they will come to know who has the weaker protector and they will come to know who has less helpers."
"Say: ""I do not know if what is promised you is near, or if my Lord prolongs its term.",24,72,قُلْ إِنْ أَدْرِىٓ أَقَرِيبٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ أَمْ يَجْعَلُ لَهُۥ رَبِّىٓ أَمَدًا,"O Messenger! Say to these idolaters who reject the resurrection: I do not know whether the punishment you are warned of is near, or whether it has a fixed time that only Allah knows."
"He is the knower of the Unknown, and He does not divulge His secret to any one",25,72,عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِۦٓ أَحَدًا,"He (may He be glorified) is the knower of the Ghaib, all of it. Nothing of it is hidden from Him. He does not disclose His Ghaib to anyone, but keeps it in His exclusive knowledge."
"Other than an apostle He has chosen, when He makes a sentinel walk in front of him and a sentinel behind,",26,72,إِلَّا مَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ فَإِنَّهُۥ يَسْلُكُ مِنۢ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِۦ رَصَدًا,"Except for a messenger whom He, may He be glorified, selects and then discloses to him what He wishes. He sends guards from the angels to go before the messenger and protect him so that no one besides the messenger gains access to this."
"So that He may know if they have delivered their Lord's messages. He comprehends all that has been given them, and keeps count of everything.",27,72,لِّيَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُوا۟ رِسَٰلَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَىٰ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَدًۢا,"This is done in the hope that the messenger may know that the messengers before him had conveyed the messages of their Lord that He had instructed them to convey because of the care that Allah gave to it. Allah’s knowledge surrounds whatever is with the angels and messengers. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. He has counted the number of everything, so that nothing is hidden from Him, may He be glorified."
"O YOU ENWRAPPED in the cloak (of Prophethood),",0,73,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُزَّمِّلُ,O you wrapped up in your clothes (i.e. the Prophet (peace be upon him)).
"Keep watch all the night except some,",1,73,قُمِ ٱلَّيْلَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,Offer prayer at night except for a little part of it.
A half of it or a little less,2,73,نِّصْفَهُۥٓ أَوِ ٱنقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلًا,"Pray for half of it if you wish, or pray for a little less than half until you reach one third."
"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.",3,73,أَوْ زِدْ عَلَيْهِ وَرَتِّلِ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ تَرْتِيلًا,Or increase it until you reach two thirds. Make the Qur’ān clear when you recite it and recite it slowly.
We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity).,4,73,إِنَّا سَنُلْقِى عَلَيْكَ قَوْلًا ثَقِيلًا,"I am going to send down on you, O Messenger, the Qur’ān, which is a heavy word, due to the obligations, limits, provisions, etiquettes etc. that it contains."
Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling.,5,73,إِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ ٱلَّيْلِ هِىَ أَشَدُّ وَطْـًٔا وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلًا,The hours of the night are more suited to the heart for recitation and more correct in speech.
Indeed during the day you have a long schedule of occupations.,6,73,إِنَّ لَكَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ سَبْحًا طَوِيلًا,"In the day you are busy in your work, and are distracted from reciting the Qur’ān, so pray at night."
"But recite the name of your Lord withdrawing yourself from everything, devoting yourself exclusively to Him.",7,73,وَٱذْكُرِ ٱسْمَ رَبِّكَ وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلًا,"Remember Allah with various forms of remembrance, and devote yourself to Him (may He be glorified) fully by making your worship solely for Him."
He is the Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He. So take Him alone as your protector.,8,73,رَّبُّ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَٱتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلًا,The Lord of the East and the Lord of the West. There is none deserving of worship besides Him. So take Him as a Trustee Whom you rely on in all your affairs.
"Bear with patience what they say, and gracefully come away from them.",9,73,وَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَٱهْجُرْهُمْ هَجْرًا جَمِيلًا,"Be patient over the mockery and abuse uttered by those who deny, and leave them in a manner that causes no harm."
"Leave those to Me who deny, the lovers of ease and comfort; and bear with them for a while.",10,73,وَذَرْنِى وَٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ أُو۟لِى ٱلنَّعْمَةِ وَمَهِّلْهُمْ قَلِيلًا,"Do not be concerned about the state of those who deny, those who enjoy the pleasures of the world. Leave them to Me and wait a little for them until their appointed time comes."
"Verily We shall have fetters with Us, and a roaring furnace,",11,73,إِنَّ لَدَيْنَآ أَنكَالًا وَجَحِيمًا,"In the afterlife, I have heavy chains and a blazing fire."
"And food that will stick in the throat, and painful torment",12,73,وَطَعَامًا ذَا غُصَّةٍ وَعَذَابًا أَلِيمًا,"And a food that chokes the throats because of its extreme bitterness, and a painful punishment, in addition to the above."
"On the day the earth and mountains will rock violently, and the mountains turn to a heap of poured-out sand.",13,73,يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ وَكَانَتِ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَثِيبًا مَّهِيلًا,That punishment will occur to those who deny on the day when the earth and the mountains will shake and the mountains will become scattered flowing sand because of its extreme horror.
"We have sent an Apostle to you as a witness against you, as We had sent an apostle to the Pharaoh.",14,73,إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولًا شَٰهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا,"I have sent to you a messenger as a witness over your actions on the day of judgment just as I sent to Pharaoh a messenger, who was Moses, (peace be upon him)."
But the Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle; so We seized him with a grievous punishment.,15,73,فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا,"But Pharaoh went against the messenger who was sent to him from his Lord, so I punished him with a severe punishment in the world by drowning and in the afterlife by the punishment of the fire. So you do not go against your messenger or you will be afflicted by what afflicted him."
"How then, if you disbelieve, will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary?",16,73,فَكَيْفَ تَتَّقُونَ إِن كَفَرْتُمْ يَوْمًا يَجْعَلُ ٱلْوِلْدَٰنَ شِيبًا,"So how will you protect yourselves - if you reject Allah and deny His messenger - from a long, severe day that will make the head of young children white because of the severity of its horror and its length."
The heavens itself will be rent asunder (on that day). His promise is bound to be fulfilled.,17,73,ٱلسَّمَآءُ مُنفَطِرٌۢ بِهِۦ كَانَ وَعْدُهُۥ مَفْعُولًا,The sky will split because of its horror. Allah’s promise will be inevitably fulfilled.
Verily this is a reminder. So let him who desires take the way to his Lord.,18,73,إِنَّ هَٰذِهِۦ تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِۦ سَبِيلًا,This admonition - containing an exposition of the horror and severity of the day of judgment - is a reminder that is of benefit to the believers. So whoever wishes to take a path that leads to His Lord let him do so.
"Your Lord surely knows that you are occupied with your devotions for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or one-third of it, as do many others with you. Yet God prescribes the measure of night and day. He knows you cannot calculate it, and so turns to you in benevolence. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God. And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. So ask for God's forgiveness. Indeed God is forgiving and kind.",19,73,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُومُ أَدْنَىٰ مِن ثُلُثَىِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَنِصْفَهُۥ وَثُلُثَهُۥ وَطَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مَعَكَ وَٱللَّهُ يُقَدِّرُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ عَلِمَ أَن لَّن تُحْصُوهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱقْرَءُوا۟ مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنَ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ عَلِمَ أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُم مَّرْضَىٰ وَءَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَءَاخَرُونَ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَٱقْرَءُوا۟ مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَأَقْرِضُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا۟ لِأَنفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ خَيْرًا وَأَعْظَمَ أَجْرًا وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌۢ,"Your Lord, O Messenger, knows that you sometimes spend less than two thirds of the night in prayer, sometimes you stand for half the night, sometimes a third, and a group of the believers stand with you. Allah determines the night and day and counts their hours. He (may He be glorified) knows that you are not able to count and keep a record of its hours, and thus standing for the most part of it seeking the required will be difficult for you. He therefore has accepted your repentance. So pray at night as much as is easy for you. Allah knows that some of you, O believers, may be ill and constrained by illness - others will be travelling seeking Allah’s provision, and others will be fighting the disbelievers seeking Allah’s pleasure and to promote Allah’s word. For these people standing in prayer at night is difficult, so pray at night as much as is easy for you and discharge the obligatory prayer in the most perfect manner. Give the charity of your wealth and spend from your wealth in Allah’s path. Whatever good you send forward for yourselves, you will find it to be better and greater in reward. Seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah Forgiving towards those of His servants who repent and He is merciful to them."
"O YOU ENFOLDED in your mantle (of reform),",0,74,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُدَّثِّرُ,O you who is covered with his clothes (this refers to the Prophet (peace be upon him)

"Glorify your Lord,",2,74,وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ,Declare the greatness of your Lord.
"Purify your inner self,",3,74,وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ,Purify yourself from sins and your clothes from impurities.
And banish all trepidation.,4,74,وَٱلرُّجْزَ فَٱهْجُرْ,Keep away from the worship of idols.
"Do not bestow favours in expectation of return,",5,74,وَلَا تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ,Do not think that you have done a favour to your Lord by regarding your righteous actions to be plenty.
And persevere in the way of your Lord.,6,74,وَلِرَبِّكَ فَٱصْبِرْ,Be patient for Allah’s sake over the harm that you incur.
For when the trumpet blows,7,74,فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى ٱلنَّاقُورِ,When the trumpet will be blown a second time.
"It will be a day of distress,",8,74,فَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ,That day will be a severe day.
Dolorous for the unbelievers.,9,74,عَلَى ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ,For those who reject Allah and His messengers it will not be easy.
"Leave him to Me whom I created alone,",10,74,ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيدًا,"Leave me, O Messenger, and the one whom I created alone in the womb of his mother without wealth or children (This refers to Walid bin Al Mughira)."
And gave him abundant wealth,11,74,وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُۥ مَالًا مَّمْدُودًا,I gave him plenty wealth.
"And sons always present by his side,",12,74,وَبَنِينَ شُهُودًا,"I gave him children who were present with him, who attended gatherings with him and who did not leave him on account of travel due to the abundance of his wealth."
And made things easy for them.,13,74,وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُۥ تَمْهِيدًا,"I extended to him his livelihood, provision and children profusely."
Yet he wants that I should give him more.,14,74,ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ,Then despite his denial of Me he desires that I give him more after I gave him all of that.
Never. He is refractory of Our signs.,15,74,كَلَّآ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لِءَايَٰتِنَا عَنِيدًا,The matter is not as he thinks. He was opposed to My verses that I revealed to My messenger denying them.
"I shall inflict on him hardship,",16,74,سَأُرْهِقُهُۥ صَعُودًا,I will impose on him difficulty from a punishment that he will not be able to bear.
For he had thought and calculated.,17,74,إِنَّهُۥ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ,"This disbeliever whom I bestowed with those favours thought about what he should say in order to refute the Qur’ān, and planned this within himself."
"May he be accursed, how he planned!",18,74,فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ,So may he be cursed and punished. How did he plan!
"May be then be accursed, how he plotted!",19,74,ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ,"Again, may he be cursed and punished. How did he plan!"
"Then he looked around,",20,74,ثُمَّ نَظَرَ,Then he reconsidered and carefully thought about what he should say.
"And frowned and puckered his brow,",21,74,ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ,The he frowned and scowled when he did not find anything to challenge the Qur’ān with.
"Then turned his back and waxed proud,",22,74,ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ,Then he turned away from faith and was too proud to follow the Prophet (peace be upon him).
"And said: ""This is nothing but the magic of old,",23,74,فَقَالَ إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ,"He said: This what Muhammad brought is not Allah’s speech, but it is sorcery that he relates from others."
"Nothing more than the speech of a man!""",24,74,إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا قَوْلُ ٱلْبَشَرِ,"This is not Allah’s speech, but it is the speech of man."
I will cast him into the fire of Hell.,25,74,سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ,"I will enter this disbeliever into one of the levels of the Fire, which is Saqar, to suffer from its heat."
What do you think Hell-fire is?,26,74,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا سَقَرُ,"What will tell you, O Muhammad, what Saqar is?!"
"It leaves nothing, nor does it spare;",27,74,لَا تُبْقِى وَلَا تَذَرُ,"It does not spare any person that is punished in it except that it comes on him and does not leave him. Then he returns to how it was and it comes to him, again and again."
It glows and burns the skin.,28,74,لَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ,It severely burns and alters skins.
Over it are nineteen (guards).,29,74,عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ,There are nineteen angels over it who are its wardens.
"We have not appointed any one but angels as keepers of Hell, and their number that We have fixed is to make it a means of contention for disbelievers, so that those who were given the Book may be certain, and the faith of the believers may have greater increase, and the people of the Book and believers may not be deceived, and the sceptics and infidels may say: ""What does God mean by this parable?"" That is how God leads whosoever He will astray, and guides whosoever He will. None knows the armies of your Lord save Him self. This is no more than reminder for mankind.",30,74,وَمَا جَعَلْنَآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلَّا مَلَٰٓئِكَةً وَمَا جَعَلْنَا عِدَّتَهُمْ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِيَسْتَيْقِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَيَزْدَادَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِيمَٰنًا وَلَا يَرْتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَلِيَقُولَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَمَا هِىَ إِلَّا ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْبَشَرِ,"I did not make the wardens of the Fire except angels, so humans do not have the power to face them. Abu Jahl was lying when he and his people claimed that they have the ability to attack them and then they will come out of the Fire. I did not make this number of theirs except to test those who reject Allah, so that the Jews who were given the Torah and the Christians who were given the Gospel will become certain when the Qur’ān that confirms what is in their scriptures is revealed, so that the faith of the believers increases when the people of the scripture agree with them and the Jews, Christians and the believers do not have any doubt, and so that those who waver in faith and those who are disbelievers say: What does Allah intend by this strange number?! Just as those who deny this number are misguided and those who accept it are guided, Allah misguides whoever He wishes to misguide and He guides whoever He wishes to guide. No one knows the forces of your Lord, because of their huge number, besides Him, may He be glorified. So let Abu Jahl who, mockingly and dismissively, said, “Does Muhammad only have nineteen aides?!” know this. The Fire is only a reminder for human beings, through which they can come to know of Allah’s greatness, may He be glorified."
"I say the truth, and call the moon to witness,",31,74,كَلَّا وَٱلْقَمَرِ,The statement is not as claimed by some idolaters that he will suffice his companions against the wardens of Hell and take them out of it. Allah took an oath by the moon.
"And the night when on the wane,",32,74,وَٱلَّيْلِ إِذْ أَدْبَرَ,He took an oath by the night when it departs.
"The morning when it is unveiled,",33,74,وَٱلصُّبْحِ إِذَآ أَسْفَرَ,He took an oath by the morning when it lights up.
"That (Hell) is surely one of the greater (signs),",34,74,إِنَّهَا لَإِحْدَى ٱلْكُبَرِ,The fire of Hell is one the great calamities.
A warning for people --,35,74,نَذِيرًا لِّلْبَشَرِ,In order to strike terror and fear in people.
Whoever of you desires to progress or lag behind.,36,74,لِمَن شَآءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَتَقَدَّمَ أَوْ يَتَأَخَّرَ,"Whoever from amongst you, O people, wishes to go forward with faith in Allah and righteous actions, or to lag behind by disbelief and sins."
"Every soul is pledged to what it does,",37,74,كُلُّ نَفْسٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ,Every soul will be taken to task for the actions that it did. Either its actions will destroy it or they will release and rescue it from destruction.
Except those of the right hand,38,74,إِلَّآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلْيَمِينِ,"Except for the believers, who wont be taken to task for their sins. Instead, these will be overlooked because of their righteous actions."
"Sitting in the gardens, asking",39,74,فِى جَنَّٰتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,"On the Day of Judgement, they will be in gardens asking one another."
Of evil-doers:,40,74,عَنِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,About the disbelievers who destroyed themselves by the sins they committed.
"""What was it that brought you to Hell?""",41,74,مَا سَلَكَكُمْ فِى سَقَرَ,They will say to them: What entered you into Hell?
"They will answer: ""We did not fulfil our devotional obligations,",42,74,قَالُوا۟ لَمْ نَكُ مِنَ ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ,The disbelievers will answer them saying: We were not of those who discharged the obligatory prayer in the worldly life.
"And did not feed the needy,",43,74,وَلَمْ نَكُ نُطْعِمُ ٱلْمِسْكِينَ,We did not feed the poor from what Allah gave us.
"And plunged into useless things with those who were obstinate,",44,74,وَكُنَّا نَخُوضُ مَعَ ٱلْخَآئِضِينَ,We used to be with the people of falsehood and go wherever they go. We used to speak to the people of misguidance and deviation.
And rejected the Day of Judgement as a lie,45,74,وَكُنَّا نُكَذِّبُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,We used to deny the day of recompense.
Until the certainty (of death) had come upon us.,46,74,حَتَّىٰٓ أَتَىٰنَا ٱلْيَقِينُ,We persisted in this denial until death came to us and prevented us from repenting.
"So, the intercession of intercessors will not avail them.",47,74,فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَٰعَةُ ٱلشَّٰفِعِينَ,"On the Day of Judgment, the mediation of intercessors from the angels, prophets and pious ones, will not benefit them, because the requirement for the acceptance of intercession is that the thing for which intercession is made must be approved."
Why then do they turn away from the admonition,48,74,فَمَا لَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلتَّذْكِرَةِ مُعْرِضِينَ,What has made these idolaters turn away from the Qur’ān?!
As though they were frightened asses,49,74,كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ,"As if they, in their turning away from and aversion to it, are wild donkeys that are extremely resistant."
Fleeing from a lion?,50,74,فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍۭ,That have fled from a lion out of fear for it.
In fact every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets).,51,74,بَلْ يُرِيدُ كُلُّ ٱمْرِئٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُؤْتَىٰ صُحُفًا مُّنَشَّرَةً,"Instead, each one of these idolaters wants for there to be an open book by his head side that tells him that Muhammad is a messenger from Allah. The reason for this is not the lack of proof or weakness of evidence. It is only obstinacy and pride."
By no means. In fact they do not fear the Hereafter.,52,74,كَلَّا بَل لَّا يَخَافُونَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ,"The matter is not like that. In fact, the reason for their persistence in their misguidance is that they do not have faith in the punishment of the afterlife, so they remained in their disbelief."
"Never so, as this is a reminder.",53,74,كَلَّآ إِنَّهُۥ تَذْكِرَةٌ,"Indeed, this Qur’ān is an admonition and a reminder."
Let him then who heeds remember it.,54,74,فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُۥ,Whoever wishes to read the Qur’ān and take lesson from it does so.
"But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving",55,74,وَمَا يَذْكُرُونَ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ هُوَ أَهْلُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَأَهْلُ ٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ,None takes lesson from it besides those whom Allah wills to take lesson. He (may He be glorified) is worthy of being mindful of by the fulfilment of His instructions and the avoidance of His prohibitions. He is worthy of forgiving the sins of His servants when they repent to Him.
"I CALL TO WITNESS the Day of Resurrection,",0,75,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ لَآ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ,Allah took an oath by the Day of Judgement when people stand before the Lord of the worlds.
And I call the reprehensive soul to witness:,1,75,وَلَآ أُقْسِمُ بِٱلنَّفْسِ ٱللَّوَّامَةِ,He took an oath by the pure soul that reproaches its owner for falling short in righteous deeds and for doing wrong deeds. He took an oath by these two things that He will certainly resurrect people for reckoning and recompense.
Does man think We shall not put his bones together?,2,75,أَيَحْسَبُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُۥ,Does man think that I will not gather his bones to be resurrected after he dies?!
Surely We are able to reform even his finger-tips.,3,75,بَلَىٰ قَٰدِرِينَ عَلَىٰٓ أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُۥ,"Indeed, I am able together with gathering them to restore his fingertips in a proportionate form just as they were."
Yet man is sceptical of what is right before him.,4,75,بَلْ يُرِيدُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُۥ,But man by his denial of the resurrection wants to continue sinning in the future unchecked.
"He asks: ""When will the Day of Resurrection be?""",5,75,يَسْـَٔلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ,He skeptically asks about the Day of Judgement: When will it occur?
"Yet when the eyes are dazzled,",6,75,فَإِذَا بَرِقَ ٱلْبَصَرُ,When the sight is dazzled and astonished at the time when it sees what it used to deny.
"The moon eclipsed,",7,75,وَخَسَفَ ٱلْقَمَرُ,And the light of the moon disappears.
"And the sun and moon are conjoined,",8,75,وَجُمِعَ ٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ,And the mass of the sun and the moon are brought together.
"That day man will say: ""Where can I find escape?""",9,75,يَقُولُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ ٱلْمَفَرُّ,The sinning person will say on that day: Where is the escape?!
"Never so, for there will be no escape.",10,75,كَلَّا لَا وَزَرَ,There is no escape on that day and there is no place in which the sinner can take refuge nor any place that he can seek protection in.
With your Lord alone will be the retreat on that day.,11,75,إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْمُسْتَقَرُّ,"The return and destination on that day will be to your Lord, O Messenger, for the reckoning and recompense."
Then man will be told what he had sent ahead (of good) and what he had left behind.,12,75,يُنَبَّؤُا۟ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ يَوْمَئِذٍۭ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ,On the day man will be informed about the actions that he sent forward and those that he left behind.
"In fact man is a witness against himself,",13,75,بَلِ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِۦ بَصِيرَةٌ,"Instead, man is a witness against himself as his limbs will testify against him in respect of the sins he committed."
Whatever the excuses he may offer.,14,75,وَلَوْ أَلْقَىٰ مَعَاذِيرَهُۥ,"Even if he brings excuses to argue on behalf of himself that he did not do any evil, these will not benefit him."
Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste.,15,75,لَا تُحَرِّكْ بِهِۦ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِۦٓ,"Do not move your tongue, O Messenger, with the Qur’ān hastily for fear of its escaping from you."
Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.,16,75,إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُۥ وَقُرْءَانَهُۥ,It is My duty to gather it in your chest and to establish its recitation on your tongue.
"So, as We recite it, follow its reading.",17,75,فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَٰهُ فَٱتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُۥ,"When Gabriel has completed its recitation to you, then be attentive and listen to its being recited."
The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us.,18,75,ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُۥ,"Then, it is My duty to explain it to you."
"But no. You love this transient life,",19,75,كَلَّا بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱلْعَاجِلَةَ,"Nay, the matter is not as you claimed about the impossibility of resurrection. You know that the One Who was able to create you the first time is not unable to bring you back to life after you die. However, the reason for your denial of resurrection, is your love for the fleeting life of the world."
And neglect the Hereafter.,20,75,وَتَذَرُونَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةَ,"And your disregard for the life of the afterlife, the path of which is to carry out the acts of obedience that Allah has instructed you to and to leave the unlawful acts that He has prohibited you from."
"How many faces will be refulgent on that Day,",21,75,وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ,The faces of the people of faith and fortune on that day will be radiant with light.
Waiting for their Lord.,22,75,إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ,Looking at their Lord with enjoyment.
And how many faces on that Day will be woe-begone,23,75,وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍۭ بَاسِرَةٌ,The faces of the people of disbelief and wretchedness on that day will be gloomy.
Fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them.,24,75,تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ,They will be sure that a great punishment and painful punishment is to come down on them.
"Never so, for when life withdraws into the clavicula,",25,75,كَلَّآ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ ٱلتَّرَاقِىَ,The matter is not as the idolaters imagined - that they will not be punished when they die. When the soul of any one of them reaches the upper part of his chest.
"And it is asked: ""Is there any reciter of charms and amulets?""",26,75,وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ,"And people say to one another: Who can heal this person, perhaps he can be cured?!"
"He will then realise it is the parting,",27,75,وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ ٱلْفِرَاقُ,The person in agony will be certain at that time that this is the departure from the world by death.
And anguish will be heaped upon anguish:,28,75,وَٱلْتَفَّتِ ٱلسَّاقُ بِٱلسَّاقِ,Difficulties will come together at the time when the world ends and the afterlife commences.
To your Lord then will be the driving.,29,75,إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْمَسَاقُ,"When this occurs, the deceased will be driven to his Lord."
"For he neither believed nor prayed,",30,75,فَلَا صَدَّقَ وَلَا صَلَّىٰ,"The disbeliever did not accept what his messenger brought to him, nor did he pray to Allah, may He be glorified."
But only disavowed and turned away;,31,75,وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,"Instead, he denied what his messenger brought to him and turned away from it."
Then he strutted back to his people.,32,75,ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِۦ يَتَمَطَّىٰٓ,Then this disbeliever went to his family swaggering in his gait out of pride.
"Alas the woe for you, alas!",33,75,أَوْلَىٰ لَكَ فَأَوْلَىٰ,Allah thus warned the disbeliever that His punishment has come close to him.
"Alas, the woe for you!",34,75,ثُمَّ أَوْلَىٰ لَكَ فَأَوْلَىٰٓ,"He then repeated the sentence by way of emphasis and stated: “Again, closer and closer it comes to you.”"
"Does man think that he will be left alone to himself, free?",35,75,أَيَحْسَبُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى,Does man think that Allah will leave him neglected without imposing any laws on him?
"Was he not an emitted drop of semen,",36,75,أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَىٰ,Was this human being one day not a drop of sperm spilt into the womb.
"Then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned",37,75,ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ,Thereafter he was a piece of coagulated blood. Then Allah created him and made his form proportionate.
"And assigned it sexes, male and female.",38,75,فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ ٱلزَّوْجَيْنِ ٱلذَّكَرَ وَٱلْأُنثَىٰٓ,Then he made his species into two types: Male and female?!
Cannot such as He bring the dead to life?,39,75,أَلَيْسَ ذَٰلِكَ بِقَٰدِرٍ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يُحْۦِىَ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ,"Is not the One Who created man from a drop, then a clot, able to give life once again to the dead for the reckoning and recompense?! Indeed, He is able to do so."
WAS THERE NOT a time in the life of man when he was not even a mentionable thing?,0,76,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ هَلْ أَتَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْإِنسَٰنِ حِينٌ مِّنَ ٱلدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْـًٔا مَّذْكُورًا,A long period of time has passed over man when he was non-existent and there was no mention of him.
"Verily We created man from a sperm yoked (to the ovum) to bring out his real substance, then gave him hearing and sight.",1,76,إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَٰهُ سَمِيعًۢا بَصِيرًا,"I created man from a drop that was a mixture of the liquid of a man and a woman, to test him with the impositions I placed on him. I made him hearing and seeing to carry out the laws I imposed on him."
We surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny.,2,76,إِنَّا هَدَيْنَٰهُ ٱلسَّبِيلَ إِمَّا شَاكِرًا وَإِمَّا كَفُورًا,"I showed him, through the tongues of My messengers, the path of guidance and by that the path of misguidance became clear to him. Thereafter he is either guided to the straight path and becomes a believing servant that is thankful to Allah, or he is misled from it and becomes a disbelieving servant who rejects Allah’s signs."
We have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire.,3,76,إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ سَلَٰسِلَا۟ وَأَغْلَٰلًا وَسَعِيرًا,"After Allah mentioned the two types, those who are guided and those astray, he mentioned the reward of each by saying: I have prepared for those who reject Allah and His messengers, chains by which they will be dragged into the fire, and iron collars that will be tied around their necks, and a blazing fire."
Surely the devotees will drink cups flavoured with palm blossoms,4,76,إِنَّ ٱلْأَبْرَارَ يَشْرَبُونَ مِن كَأْسٍ كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا كَافُورًا,The believers who follow Allah will drink on the day of judgment from a filled cup of wine mixed with camphor because of its pleasant fragrance.
From a spring of which the votaries of God will drink and make it flow in abundance.,5,76,عَيْنًا يَشْرَبُ بِهَا عِبَادُ ٱللَّهِ يُفَجِّرُونَهَا تَفْجِيرًا,"This drink that has been prepared for the people of obedience will be from a easily palatable, abundantly flowing spring which will not dry out. The servants of Allah will drink to their fill from it, and be able to cause it to flow and run wherever they wish."
"Those who fulfil their vows and fear the Day whose evil shall be diffused far and wide,",6,76,يُوفُونَ بِٱلنَّذْرِ وَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا كَانَ شَرُّهُۥ مُسْتَطِيرًا,"The attributes of the servants who will drink from it, are that they fulfil the acts of obedience to Allah they have imposed upon themselves, and they fear a day of widespread calamity: The Day of Judgement."
"And feed the needy for the love of Him, and the orphans and the captives,",7,76,وَيُطْعِمُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِۦ مِسْكِينًا وَيَتِيمًا وَأَسِيرًا,"They also feed food, despite being in the state of loving food due to being needy and desirous of it. They feed it to the poor, orphans and captives."
"(Saying): ""We feed you for the sake of God, desiring neither recompense nor thanks.",8,76,إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءً وَلَا شُكُورًا,"They conceal within themselves that they only feed them for the pleasure of Allah; not intending to receive any recompense from those whom they have fed, nor any praise."
"We fear the dismal day calamitous from our Lord.""",9,76,إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْمًا عَبُوسًا قَمْطَرِيرًا,We fear from our Lord a day on which the faces of the wretched will be gloomy due to its severity and horror.
"So God will protect them from the evil of that day, and grant them happiness and joy,",10,76,فَوَقَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّىٰهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا,"So Allah will protect them through His grace from the harm of that great day, and will give them beauty and light on their faces in their honour, together with placing happiness in their hearts."
"And reward them for their perseverence Paradise and silken robes,",11,76,وَجَزَىٰهُم بِمَا صَبَرُوا۟ جَنَّةً وَحَرِيرًا,"And Allah will reward them due to their endurance upon acts of obedience, patience upon the decrees of Allah, and resolve from committing sins, with a Paradise in which they shall live in luxury, wearing clothes made of silk."
Where they will recline on couches feeling neither heat of the sun nor intense cold.,12,76,مُّتَّكِـِٔينَ فِيهَا عَلَى ٱلْأَرَآئِكِ لَا يَرَوْنَ فِيهَا شَمْسًا وَلَا زَمْهَرِيرًا,"They will be reclining in it on decorated couches. They will not see in this Paradise a sun to be inconvenienced by its rays, nor will they experience extreme cold; rather they will be in constant shade, without extreme heat or cold."
"The shadows will bend over them, and low will hang the clusters of grapes.",13,76,وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَٰلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلًا,"Its shade will be near to them, and its fruits will be made subservient to whoever eats them, making them easy to access and eat, such that a person lying down, sitting or standing will be able to eat them."
"Passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass,",14,76,وَيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِم بِـَٔانِيَةٍ مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَأَكْوَابٍ كَانَتْ قَوَارِيرَا۠,Servants will roam around them with silver utensils and clear glasses whenever they intend to drink.
"And crystal clear bottles of silver, of which they will determine the measure themselves.",15,76,قَوَارِيرَا۟ مِن فِضَّةٍ قَدَّرُوهَا تَقْدِيرًا,"In their clear colour, they will be like glass, yet they will be made of silver, and they will be measured to perfection: neither bigger or smaller than they intend."
There will they drink a cup flavoured with ginger,16,76,وَيُسْقَوْنَ فِيهَا كَأْسًا كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنجَبِيلًا,"These honoured people will be given a glass of wine to drink, mixed with ginger."
From a spring by the name of Ever-flowing-Salsabil.,17,76,عَيْنًا فِيهَا تُسَمَّىٰ سَلْسَبِيلًا,They will also drink from a spring in Paradise named Salsabīl.
And boys of everlasting youth will go about attending them. Looking at them you would think that they were pearls dispersed.,18,76,وَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَٰنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ إِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ حَسِبْتَهُمْ لُؤْلُؤًا مَّنثُورًا,"And youthful children will roam around them in Paradise. When you see them you will think of them to be scattered pearls, because of the freshness in their faces, their beautiful complexions, their number and their distinction."
"When you look around, you will see delights and great dominion.",19,76,وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيمًا وَمُلْكًا كَبِيرًا,"When you see what is in Paradise, you will see undescribable luxury and a magnificent kingdom that is unparalleled."
"On their bodies will be garments of the finest green silk and brocade, and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give them a purest draught to drink.",20,76,عَٰلِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ وَحُلُّوٓا۟ أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ وَسَقَىٰهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَابًا طَهُورًا,"Magnificent green clothes will adorn their upper bodies, made of fine silk and silk brocade. They will also be made to wear silver bracelets, and Allah will give them to drink, a drink free of any spoiling."
"""This in truth is your recompense, and acceptance of your endeavours.""",21,76,إِنَّ هَٰذَا كَانَ لَكُمْ جَزَآءً وَكَانَ سَعْيُكُم مَّشْكُورًا,"It will be said to them in their honour: “Indeed, this luxury you have been given is a reward for you for your good deeds; your deeds were acceptable with Allah.”"
We have revealed the Qur'an to you gradually;,22,76,إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ تَنزِيلًا,"O Messenger! Indeed, I have revealed the Qur’ān to you in segments; I did not reveal it to you all at once."
"So wait for your Lord's command, and do not follow any sinner or disbeliever among them.",23,76,فَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلَا تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ ءَاثِمًا أَوْ كَفُورًا,"So be patient over what Allah decrees or legislates, and do not follow the sinner in the sin he calls towards, nor the disbeliever in the disbelief he invites towards."
Meditate upon the name of your Lord morning and evening;,24,76,وَٱذْكُرِ ٱسْمَ رَبِّكَ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا,"And remember your Lord by performing the Fajr prayer at the starting of the day, and the Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr prayers at its end."
"And bow in homage part of the night, and glorify Him far into the night.",25,76,وَمِنَ ٱلَّيْلِ فَٱسْجُدْ لَهُۥ وَسَبِّحْهُ لَيْلًا طَوِيلًا,"And remember Him by performing the two prayers of the night: The Maghrib and ‘Ishā prayers, together with performing Tahajjud after them."
Surely men love what hastes away and forget the grievous day (ahead).,26,76,إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ يُحِبُّونَ ٱلْعَاجِلَةَ وَيَذَرُونَ وَرَآءَهُمْ يَوْمًا ثَقِيلًا,"Indeed, these idolaters love the worldly life and are greedy for it, leaving behind them the Day of Judgement which is a burdensome day due to the difficulties and tests in it."
We created them and fixed their bones and joints; and We could replace them when We like with others like them.,27,76,نَّحْنُ خَلَقْنَٰهُمْ وَشَدَدْنَآ أَسْرَهُمْ وَإِذَا شِئْنَا بَدَّلْنَآ أَمْثَٰلَهُمْ تَبْدِيلًا,"I have created them and strengthened their creation by giving strength in their joints, limbs etc. And if I wanted to destroy them and replace them with people like them, I would have done so."
This surely is a reminder: Therefore whosoever desires may take the way to his Lord.,28,76,إِنَّ هَٰذِهِۦ تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِۦ سَبِيلًا,"Indeed, this Sūrah is a piece of advice and a reminder; whoever wishes to take it as a path to the pleasure of his Lord should do so."
But you will not desire except as God wills. Verily He is all-knowing and all-wise.,29,76,وَمَا تَشَآءُونَ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا,"You do not wish to take the path to the pleasure of Allah except that Allah also wishes that from you, because the matter is fully in His control. Indeed, Allah knows the requirements of His servants and what they do not require; He is wise in His creation, decree and legislation."
He admits whosoever He will to His benevolence. But for the evil-doers He has prepared a painful punishment.,30,76,يُدْخِلُ مَن يَشَآءُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِۦ وَٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ أَعَدَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًۢا,"He enters whichever of His servants He wishes into His mercy, granting them the ability to bring faith and do good deeds. He has also prepared for those who oppress themselves by disbelieving and committing sins, a painful punishment in the afterlife: the punishment of the hellfire."
"I CALL TO WITNESS those who are sent consecutively,",0,77,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلْمُرْسَلَٰتِ عُرْفًا,"Allah takes an oath on the constant winds, like the mane of a horse."
"And those that strike violently,",1,77,فَٱلْعَٰصِفَٰتِ عَصْفًا,And He also takes an oath on the severely blowing winds.
"And those that revive by quickening,",2,77,وَٱلنَّٰشِرَٰتِ نَشْرًا,And also on the winds that disperse the rain.
"And those that distinguish distinctly,",3,77,فَٱلْفَٰرِقَٰتِ فَرْقًا,And He also takes an oath on the angels that descend with that which differentiates between truth and falsehood.
And those that bring down the Reminder,4,77,فَٱلْمُلْقِيَٰتِ ذِكْرًا,And He also takes an oath on the angels who descend bringing revelation.
To end all argument or to warn.,5,77,عُذْرًا أَوْ نُذْرًا,"They descend bringing revelation as a warning from Allah so that He is excused, and warning the people of the punishment of Allah."
What is promised will surely come to pass.,6,77,إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَٰقِعٌ,"Indeed, the resurrection, accounting and requital you have been promised is to happen, inevitably."
"When the stars are obliterated,",7,77,فَإِذَا ٱلنُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ,"When it happens, the stars will suddenly lose their shine, and their light will be extinguished."
"The heavens split asunder,",8,77,وَإِذَا ٱلسَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ,The sky will suddenly crack because of the angels descending from it.
"The mountains reduced to dust and blown away,",9,77,وَإِذَا ٱلْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ,"The mountains will be suddenly uprooted from their places, and will be made to break up into pieces until they become like dust particles."
And when the time comes for raising the little girls (buried alive) --,10,77,وَإِذَا ٱلرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ,And the Messengers will be gathered for a fixed time.
For what day is that time fixed?,11,77,لِأَىِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ,"For a great day which has been delayed, so that they can testify against their nations."
The Day of Judgement.,12,77,لِيَوْمِ ٱلْفَصْلِ,"For the day of separation between the servants, so that the true can be made clear from the false, and the fortunate from the wretched."
How will you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?,13,77,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا يَوْمُ ٱلْفَصْلِ,O Messenger! What do you know of the day of separation?
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,14,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors who rejected whatever the Messengers brought from Allah."
Have We not destroyed the earlier generations?,15,77,أَلَمْ نُهْلِكِ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ,Did I not destroy the previous nations when they disbelieved in Allah and rejected their Messengers?
So shall We make the later ones to follow them.,16,77,ثُمَّ نُتْبِعُهُمُ ٱلْءَاخِرِينَ,"Then I followed the rejectors up by sending the later ones into the world, and then destroyed them just as I destroyed those before them."
That is what We shall do to those who are guilty of crime.,17,77,كَذَٰلِكَ نَفْعَلُ بِٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"Like My destruction of those nations, I will destroy the criminals who reject that which Muhammad (peace be upon him) has brought."
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,18,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors of the warning of Allah of the punishment for the criminals."
Did We not create you from contemptible water?,19,77,أَلَمْ نَخْلُقكُّم مِّن مَّآءٍ مَّهِينٍ,"O people! Did I not create you from a small amount of despised fluid, i.e. a drop of semen?"
Then We lodged you in a secure place (the womb),20,77,فَجَعَلْنَٰهُ فِى قَرَارٍ مَّكِينٍ,I then put that contemptuous fluid into a safe place i.e. the woman’s womb.
"For a certain appointed time,",21,77,إِلَىٰ قَدَرٍ مَّعْلُومٍ,"For a known period of time, i.e. the duration of pregnancy."
Then We facilitated (your birth). How well do We calculate!,22,77,فَقَدَرْنَا فَنِعْمَ ٱلْقَٰدِرُونَ,"I then decreed the attributes of that child, its fate, colour etc., so I am a greatly capable of all that."
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,23,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors of the capability of Allah."
Have We not made the earth a repository,24,77,أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ ٱلْأَرْضَ كِفَاتًا,Did I not make the earth capable of holding all the people?
"For the living and the dead,",25,77,أَحْيَآءً وَأَمْوَٰتًا,"It holds their living by letting them live and populate it, and their dead by allowing them to be buried in it."
"And placed in it lofty and broad stablisers, and gave you sweet water to drink?",26,77,وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ شَٰمِخَٰتٍ وَأَسْقَيْنَٰكُم مَّآءً فُرَاتًا,"I also placed high, rooted mountains on it that stop it from shaking. And O people! I provide you with sweet water to drink. So whoever created all that is not incapable of resurrecting you."
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,27,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors of the favours of Allah."
"""Go to what you used to deny;",28,77,ٱنطَلِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَا كُنتُم بِهِۦ تُكَذِّبُونَ,It will be said to those who rejected whatever their Messengers brought: “O rejectors! Walk to the punishment you used to reject.”
"Go to the shadow with three ramifications,",29,77,ٱنطَلِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَٰثِ شُعَبٍ,"“Walk to the shadow of the smoke of the hellfire, which is split into three parts”"
Neither shady nor protecting against the blazing Fire.,30,77,لَّا ظَلِيلٍ وَلَا يُغْنِى مِنَ ٱللَّهَبِ,"“There is no coolness of shade in it, nor does it stop the flares of the hellfire or its heat from reaching you.”"
It will throw out sparks as logs of wood,31,77,إِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَٱلْقَصْرِ,"Indeed, the hellfire spits out sparks, each spark like a palace in size."
"So like golden camels.""",32,77,كَأَنَّهُۥ جِمَٰلَتٌ صُفْرٌ,It is as if the sparks that it spits out are black mountains in their darkness and size.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,33,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors who rejected whatever the Messengers brought from Allah."
"They will not be able to speak that day,",34,77,هَٰذَا يَوْمُ لَا يَنطِقُونَ,This is a day on which they will not speak at all.
Nor given leave to make excuses.,35,77,وَلَا يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ,Neither will they be given permission to present excuses to their Lord for their disbelief and evils.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!,36,77,وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"Destruction, punishment and loss on that day will be for the rejectors of the news of this day."

"Those who take heed for themselves and fear God, will be amidst shade and springs of water,",40,77,إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِى ظِلَٰلٍ وَعُيُونٍ,"Indeed, those who are mindful of their Lord by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things he has not allowed, they will be in the extending shade of the trees of Paradise, and among sweet, flowing springs."
And such fruits as they desire.,41,77,وَفَوَٰكِهَ مِمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,And among fruits they desire to eat.
"""Eat and drink with relish as reward for what you had done.""",42,77,كُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ هَنِيٓـًٔۢا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"And it will be said to them: “Eat from the good, and drink a pleasant, unspoiled drink in return for your good deeds in the world.”"

"And direct affairs by command,",4,79,فَٱلْمُدَبِّرَٰتِ أَمْرًا,"He also takes an oath on the angels who execute the decree of Allah that He has commanded them to, i.e. the angels appointed to the deeds of the servants.

"Hearts will pound loudly on that day,",7,79,قُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ,The hearts of some people will be fearful on that day.
Eyes be lowered in submission.,8,79,أَبْصَٰرُهَا خَٰشِعَةٌ,The effects of humiliation will be apparent on their faces.
"They say: ""Shall we go back to our original state",9,79,يَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى ٱلْحَافِرَةِ,They would say: “Will we be returned to life after we have died?”

"It will only be a single blast,",12,79,فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَٰحِدَةٌ,The matter of the resurrection is easy. It will only be a single scream from the angel appointed to blow.
And they will wake up suddenly.,13,79,فَإِذَا هُم بِٱلسَّاهِرَةِ,"Then suddenly, everyone will be alive on the face of the earth, after they were dead within it."
Has the story of Moses come to you,14,79,هَلْ أَتَىٰكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰٓ,"O Messenger! Has the news of Moses, his Lord and enemy, Pharaoh, come to you?"
When his Lord called to him in Tuwa's holy vale?,15,79,إِذْ نَادَىٰهُ رَبُّهُۥ بِٱلْوَادِ ٱلْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى,When his Lord may He be glorified called out to him at the blessed valley of Tuwa.
"""Go to the Pharaoh who has become refractory,",16,79,ٱذْهَبْ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُۥ طَغَىٰ,"Among the things He said to him was: “Go to Pharaoh; indeed, he has trespassed the limits of oppression and arrogance.”"
And say: 'Would you like to grow (in virtue)?,17,79,فَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَىٰٓ أَن تَزَكَّىٰ,“Then say to him: “O Pharaoh! Do you want to purify yourself from disbelief and sins?”
"Then I will guide you to your Lord that you may come to fear Him.'""",18,79,وَأَهْدِيَكَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَتَخْشَىٰ,"“I will guide you to your Lord who has created you and provided for you so that you can fear Him and act according to His pleasure, together with refraining from things that cause His wrath.”"
So he showed him the greater sign;,19,79,فَأَرَىٰهُ ٱلْءَايَةَ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰ,"Moses (peace be upon him) then showed him the great miracle that proved he was a Messenger from his Lord, i.e. the Hand and the Staff."
But (the Pharaoh) disavowed and disobeyed.,20,79,فَكَذَّبَ وَعَصَىٰ,"Pharaoh did not do anything except reject these signs, and disobeyed the instruction Moses (peace be upon him) gave to him."
"Then he turned away, deliberating,",21,79,ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَىٰ,He then turned away from bringing faith in what Moses had brought.
"And assembled (his council) and proclaimed,",22,79,فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَىٰ,"And turned his attention to mobilising his armies to overpower Moses. He called out to his people, saying:"
"Saying: ""I am alone your lord, the highest of them all.""",23,79,فَقَالَ أَنَا۠ رَبُّكُمُ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰ,“I am your highest Lord; you are not to be obedient to anyone except me.”
So God seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and this world.,24,79,فَأَخَذَهُ ٱللَّهُ نَكَالَ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ وَٱلْأُولَىٰٓ,"So Allah seized him and punished him in the world by drowning him in the sea, and He will punish him in the afterlife by entering him into the severest punishment."
Truly there is a lesson in this for those who fear (the consequences).,25,79,إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰٓ,"Indeed, in My punishing of Pharaoh in the world and the afterlife, there is admonition for the one who fears Allah, because it is he who benefits from the admonitions."
"Are you more difficult to create or the heavens? He built it,",26,79,ءَأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ بَنَىٰهَا,"O rejectors of the resurrection! Is your origination, or the origination of the heavens that He has created, harder for Allah?"
"Raised it high, proportioned it,",27,79,رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّىٰهَا,"He raised the peak of the heaven vertically, and made it smooth: there is no break, crack or defect in it."
"Gave darkness to its night, and brightness to its day;",28,79,وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَىٰهَا,"And He darkened its night when the sun set, while manifesting its light when it rose."
And afterwards spread out the earth.,29,79,وَٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَىٰهَآ,"As for the earth after He created the heavens, He spread it out and placed within it its benefits."
"He brought out its water and its pastures from it,",30,79,أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَىٰهَا,"He extracted water from it in the form of flowing springs, and made plants grow on it which the livestock graze."
And stabilized the mountains,31,79,وَٱلْجِبَالَ أَرْسَىٰهَا,And He made the mountains stand firm on the earth.
As convenience for you and your cattle.,32,79,مَتَٰعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَٰمِكُمْ,"O people! All that is for your benefit, and for the benefit of your livestock. So whoever created all that, is not incapable of recreating you anew."
"When the great calamity comes,",33,79,فَإِذَا جَآءَتِ ٱلطَّآمَّةُ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰ,"So when the second blowing will come, which will cover everything with its terror, and the judgement will occur."
"The day when man remembers all that he had done,",34,79,يَوْمَ يَتَذَكَّرُ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ مَا سَعَىٰ,"On the day when it will come, the human will remember what deeds he sent forth: whether good or bad."
"And Hell made visible to him who can see,",35,79,وَبُرِّزَتِ ٱلْجَحِيمُ لِمَن يَرَىٰ,And hell will be brought and unveiled clearly for all to see.
Then he who had been rebellious,36,79,فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَىٰ,As for the one who transgressed the limits into deviance.
"And who preferred the life of the world,",37,79,وَءَاثَرَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا,And gave priority to the temporary worldly life over the everlasting afterlife.
Will surely have Hell for his abode.,38,79,فَإِنَّ ٱلْجَحِيمَ هِىَ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ,"Then indeed, the hellfire is his abode he will take shelter towards."
"But he who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained his self from vain desires,",39,79,وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِۦ وَنَهَى ٱلنَّفْسَ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰ,"& 41. And as for the one who feared his standing before his Lord and stopped himself from following his desires that were made impermissible by Allah, then Paradise is his abode he will take shelter towards."
Will surely have Paradise for abode.,40,79,فَإِنَّ ٱلْجَنَّةَ هِىَ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ,"& 41. And as for the one who feared his standing before his Lord and stopped himself from following his desires that were made impermissible by Allah, then Paradise is his abode he will take shelter towards."
"They ask you: ""When will the Hour be? When is its time fixed?""",41,79,يَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلسَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَىٰهَا,O Messenger! These rejectors of the resurrection ask you: “When will the Hour occur?”
What do you have to do with explaining it?,42,79,فِيمَ أَنتَ مِن ذِكْرَىٰهَآ,"You do not have any knowledge regarding it that you can mention to them; nor is it befitting of your duty to, because your duty is only to prepare for it."
The extent of its knowledge goes to your Lord.,43,79,إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَىٰهَآ,The total knowledge of the Hour is with your Lord alone.
Your duty is only to warn him who fears it.,44,79,إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰهَا,"You are only a warner to the one who fears the Hour, because he is the one who benefits from your warning."
"The day they see it, it will seem they had stayed in the world but only an evening or its turning into dawn.",45,79,كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَىٰهَا,"It is as if on the day they see the Hour for themselves, they will not have remained in their worldly lives except for a single evening or morning."
"HE FROWNED AND turned away,",0,80,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰٓ,The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) frowned and turned away.
Because a blind man came to him.,1,80,أَن جَآءَهُ ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ,"Because of the arrival of ‘Abdullah ibn Umm Maktūm who came asking for guidance. He was blind, and had come when the Messenger (peace be upon him) was busy with the seniors of the idolaters, hoping they would be guided."
"What made you think that he will not grow in virtue,",2,80,وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُۥ يَزَّكَّىٰٓ,"O Messenger! What do you know, maybe this blind man may be purified of his sins?"
"Or be admonished, and the admonition profit him?",3,80,أَوْ يَذَّكَّرُ فَتَنفَعَهُ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰٓ,Or that he may take heed of the advices he hears from you and benefit from them?
"As for him who is not in want of any thing,",4,80,أَمَّا مَنِ ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ,"As for those who feel they have no need to bring faith in what you have brought, due to the wealth they possess."
"You pay full attention,",5,80,فَأَنتَ لَهُۥ تَصَدَّىٰ,You persevere behind them and are attentive to them.
Though it is not your concern if he should not grow (in fulness).,6,80,وَمَا عَلَيْكَ أَلَّا يَزَّكَّىٰ,What blame will there be on you if he is not purified of his sins by not repenting to Allah?

You neglect.,9,80,فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّىٰ,You are preoccupied from him with others i.e. the senior idolaters.
Assuredly this is a reminder,10,80,كَلَّآ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ,It should not be like that; it is only admonition and a reminder for those who pay attention.
"For any one who desires to bear it in mind,",11,80,فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُۥ,"So whoever wishes to remember Allah should remember Him, and take heed of what is in this Qur’ān."
"(Contained) in honoured pages,",12,80,فِى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ,"Because this Qur’ān is in blessed scrolls, with the angels."
"Exalted and holy,",13,80,مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍۭ,"They are raised on a high place, pure; no dirt or filth reaches them."
In the hands of scribes,14,80,بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ,And they are in the hands of Messengers among the angels.
Noble and pious.,15,80,كِرَامٍۭ بَرَرَةٍ,"They are honourable in the eyes of their Lord, frequent performers of goodness and obedience."
Accursed is man. How ungrateful is he!,16,80,قُتِلَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ مَآ أَكْفَرَهُۥ,The disbelieving human is cursed; how severe is his disbelief in Allah!
Of what substance God created him?,17,80,مِنْ أَىِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُۥ,"What substance did Allah create him from, that he has the right to display arrogance on earth and disbelieve in Him?!"
"From a single sperm He created, then proportioned him,",18,80,مِن نُّطْفَةٍ خَلَقَهُۥ فَقَدَّرَهُۥ,"He created him from a small amount of fluid, and managed his creation in stages."
Then made his passage easy (at birth);,19,80,ثُمَّ ٱلسَّبِيلَ يَسَّرَهُۥ,"Then after these stages, He made the exit from his mother’s belly easy for him."
He will then send him to death and have him laid in the grave.,20,80,ثُمَّ أَمَاتَهُۥ فَأَقْبَرَهُۥ,"Then, after spending the amount of life decreed for him, Allah caused death upon him and made a grave for him wherein he remains until he is resurrected."

"Beware! Do not obey him, but bow in adoration and draw near (to your Lord).",18,96,كَلَّا لَا تُطِعْهُ وَٱسْجُدْ وَٱقْتَرِب,"It is not as this oppressor thinks: that he can cause any harm to you. So do not follow him in command or prohibition; rather, prostrate to Allah and draw closer to Him through acts of obedience, because that is how you can draw closer to Him."
TRULY WE REVEALED it on the Night of Determination.,0,97,بِّسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ ٱلْقَدْرِ,"Indeed, I revealed the Qur’ān at once to the heaven nearest to the world, just as I started off revealing it to Muhammad (peace be upon him), on the Night of Decree in the month of Ramadan."
How will you know what the Night of Determination is?,1,97,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ,O Prophet! Do you know what goodness and blessings lie in this night?
Better is the Night of Determination than a thousand months.,2,97,لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ,"This night is a night of great goodness; it is better than a thousand months for the one who stands in prayer during it, whilst having faith and hoping for reward."
"On (this night) the angels and grace descend by the dispensation of their Lord, for settling all affairs.",3,97,تَنَزَّلُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَٱلرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ,"The angels and Gabriel (peace be upon him) descend during it with the permission of their Lord (may He be glorified), bringing every matter Allah has decreed to happen that year, whether it be sustenance, deaths, births or anything else He has decreed."
It is peace till the dawning of the day.,4,97,سَلَٰمٌ هِىَ حَتَّىٰ مَطْلَعِ ٱلْفَجْرِ,"This whole blessed night contains goodness, right from its beginning until its end, with the breaking of dawn."
"THOSE AMONG THE people of the Book who disbelieve, and the idolaters, would not have been freed (from false beliefs) until the clear proof came to them --",0,98,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ,"Those who disbelieved, from the Jews, the Christians and the idolaters, are not going to break their consensus and agreement on disbelief, until a clear proof and manifest evidence comes to them."
"An Apostle from God, reading out hallowed pages",1,98,رَسُولٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ يَتْلُوا۟ صُحُفًا مُّطَهَّرَةً,"This clear proof and manifest evidence is a Messenger from Allah whom He has sent, and who recites pure scriptures, only the purest of beings may touch them."
Containing firm decrees.,2,98,فِيهَا كُتُبٌ قَيِّمَةٌ,"In those scriptures is true information and fair rulings, which guide the people towards that in which lies their righteousness and decency."
The people of the Book were not divided among themselves till after the clear proof had come to them.,3,98,وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ,"The Jews who were given the Torah and the Christians who were given the Gospel, did not disagree except after Allah sent His Prophet to them. There were some who became Muslims, and others who persisted in their disbelief despite knowing of the truth of their Prophet."
"They were commanded only to serve God with all-exclusive faith in Him, to be upright, and to fulfil their devotional obligations, and to give zakat; for this is the even way.",4,98,وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ وَيُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ ٱلْقَيِّمَةِ,"The criminality and stubbornness of the Jews and the Christians is evident, in that they have not been commanded in this Qur’ān, except to do those very things they have been commanded to do in both their books, i.e. worshipping Allah alone, refraining from ascribing partners to Him, establishing prayer and giving in Zakat. So whatever they have been commanded to do, is actually the straight religion in which there is no deviance."
"Surely the unbelievers among the people of the Book and the idolaters, will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.",5,98,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ فِى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ ٱلْبَرِيَّةِ,"Indeed, those who disbelieved - from the Jews, the Christians and the idolaters - will enter into hell on the Day of Judgement, wherein they shall remain forever. They are the worst of the creation because of their disbelief in Allah and rejection of His Messenger."
"But those who believe and do the right are surely the best of created beings,",6,98,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ ٱلْبَرِيَّةِ,"Indeed, those who have faith in Allah and do good deeds, they are the ones who are the best of creation."
"Whose reward is with their Lord -- gardens of Eden with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God pleased with their service, they with obedience to Him. This (awaits) him who stands in awe of his Lord.",7,98,جَزَآؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّٰتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا رَّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ رَبَّهُۥ,"Their reward with their Lord (may He be glorified) is gardens under the trees and palaces of which rivers flow, and wherein they shall remain forever. Allah is pleased with them because of them bringing faith in Him and obeying Him, and they are also pleased with Him because of Him giving them His mercy. This mercy can be acquired by the one who fears his Lord, and so fulfils His command and refrains from the thing He has not allowed."
"WHEN THE WORLD is shaken up by its cataclysm,",0,99,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا,"When the earth will be shaken vigorously, which will happen to it on the Day of Judgement."
"And the earth throws out its burdens,",1,99,وَأَخْرَجَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا,"And the earth will remove everything from within itself, i.e. the dead and other things."
"And man enquires: ""What has come over it?""",2,99,وَقَالَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ مَا لَهَا,"And the human will say, confused: “What is the matter with the earth, that it is moving and shaking?”"
"That day it will narrate its annals,",3,99,يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا,"On that great day, the earth will inform regarding the good and evil deeds that were committed upon it."
For your Lord will have commanded it.,4,99,بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا,Because Allah will have taught it and commanded it to do so.
That day people will proceed separately to be shown their deeds.,5,99,يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ ٱلنَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا۟ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,"On that great day on which the earth will quake, the humans will come to of the place of reckoning in groups, to see the deeds they committed in the world."
Whosoever has done even an atom's weight of good will behold it;,6,99,فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُۥ,"So whoever did a good or righteous deed equal to the weight of a small ant, will see it in front of him."
And whosoever has done even an atom's weight of evil will behold that.,7,99,وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُۥ,"And whoever did an evil deed equal to that, will see that in front of him also."
"I CALL TO witness the chargers, snorting, rushing to battle before the others,",0,100,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلْعَٰدِيَٰتِ ضَبْحًا,Allah takes an oath on the horses that run so hard that their breath can be heard.
"Then those striking sparks of fire,",1,100,فَٱلْمُورِيَٰتِ قَدْحًا,"And He also takes an oath on the horses who, when their shoes strike the stones with force, sparks fly."
Then those charging in the morning,2,100,فَٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ صُبْحًا,And He also takes an oath on the horses that raid the enemy at dawn.
"Raising clouds of dust,",3,100,فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِۦ نَقْعًا,And unsettle the dust by their running.
"Penetrating deep into the armies,",4,100,فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِۦ جَمْعًا,They then take their riders collectively into the midst of the enemy.
That man is ungrateful to his Lord,5,100,إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لِرَبِّهِۦ لَكَنُودٌ,"Indeed, the human is hesitant of the goodness his Lord intends from him."
"And is himself witness to it,",6,100,وَإِنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ لَشَهِيدٌ,"And indeed, he is witness to the goodness he is hesitant in giving; he cannot deny it because of its clarity."
And is intractable in his love of worldly goods.,7,100,وَإِنَّهُۥ لِحُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ,"And indeed, he is miserly with his wealth due to his extreme love for it."
Does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare,8,100,أَفَلَا يَعْلَمُ إِذَا بُعْثِرَ مَا فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ,"Does this human, deceived by the worldly life, not know that when Allah will resurrect the dead from their graves and take them out of the earth to take them to account and requite them, that the matter will not be as he imagines?"
"And the secrets of the hearts exposed,",9,100,وَحُصِّلَ مَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ,"And the intentions, beliefs etc. within the hearts will be made clear and apparent."
Surely their Lord will be aware of their (deeds).,10,100,إِنَّ رَبَّهُم بِهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّخَبِيرٌۢ,"Indeed, their Lord will be aware of every matter of theirs on that day; none of the affairs of His servants will be hidden from Him, and He will requite them for that."
THE STARTLING CALAMITY.,0,101,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,The hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors.
What is the startling calamity?,1,101,مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,What is this hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors?
How will you comprehend what the startling calamity is? --,2,101,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,O Messenger! And what do you know of this hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors? It is the Day of Judgement.
"A Day on which human beings would be like so many scattered moths,",3,101,يَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ,"On the day when the hearts of people will be struck, they will be like locusts, dispersed here and there."
The mountains like the tufts of carded wool.,4,101,وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ ٱلْمَنفُوشِ,"And the mountains will be like carded wool, in the way they will move from their places with force."
Then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale,5,101,فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ,As for the one whose good deeds will outweigh his evil deeds.
Will have a tranquil life;,6,101,فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ,He will live a contented life which he will achieve in Paradise.
But he whose deeds are lighter in the balance,7,101,وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ,And as for the one whose evil deeds outweigh his good deeds.
Will have the Abyss for abode.,8,101,فَأُمُّهُۥ هَاوِيَةٌ,His abode and permanent resting place will be hell on the Day of Judgement.
How will you comprehend what that is?,9,101,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا هِيَهْ,O Messenger! What do you know what that is?
It is the scorching fire.,10,101,نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌۢ,It is the intensely hot hellfire.
THE AVARICE OF plenitude keeps you occupied,0,102,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ أَلْهَىٰكُمُ ٱلتَّكَاثُرُ,O people! Boasting with one another over wealth and offspring has preoccupied you from the obedience of Allah.
Till you reach the grave.,1,102,حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ ٱلْمَقَابِرَ,Until you die and enter your graves.
But you will come to know soon; --,2,102,كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,It is not befitting that boasting with one another over that preoccupies you from the obedience of Allah; you will soon know the consequence of that preoccupation.
Indeed you will come to know soon.,3,102,ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,You will surely realise its outcome.
And yet if you knew with positive knowledge,4,102,كَلَّا لَوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"Truly, if you were to know with certainty that you are to be resurrected to Allah, and that He will requite you for your actions, you would not become preoccupied with boasting with one another over wealth and offspring."
You have indeed to behold Hell;,5,102,لَتَرَوُنَّ ٱلْجَحِيمَ,By Allah! You will definitely witness the hellfire on the Day of Judgement.
Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.,6,102,ثُمَّ لَتَرَوُنَّهَا عَيْنَ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"Then, you will definitely see it in a way you will become undoubtedly convinced."
Then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures.,7,102,ثُمَّ لَتُسْـَٔلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Then Allah will surely ask you on that day regarding the health, wealth etc. that He favoured you with."
TIME AND AGE are witness,0,103,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَٱلْعَصْرِ,Allah may He be glorified takes an oath on time.
"Man is certainly loss,",1,103,إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ,"Indeed, the human is in great loss and destruction."
"Except those who believe, and do good and enjoin truth on one another, and enjoin one another to bear with fortitude (the trials that befall).",2,103,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ,"Except for those who have faith in Allah and His Messenger, perform good deeds, and encourage each other to follow the truth and remain steadfast upon it. Those who have these qualities are the ones who are successful in the world and the afterlife."
"WOE TO EVERY slanderer, back-biter,",0,104,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ,Evil consequences and a severe punishment awaits the one who frequently backbites the people and taunts them.
Who amasses wealth and hordes it.,1,104,ٱلَّذِى جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُۥ,The one whose only concern is to amass wealth and count it; he has no other concern.
Does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him?,2,104,يَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُۥٓ أَخْلَدَهُۥ,"He thinks that the wealth of his he amasses will save him from death, and that he will remain forever in this worldly life."
By no means. He will be thrown into Hutama.,3,104,كَلَّا لَيُنۢبَذَنَّ فِى ٱلْحُطَمَةِ,"It is not as this ignorant one thinks; he will surely be thrown into the fire of hell that crushes and breaks everything that is thrown into it, due to its immense strength."
How will you comprehend what Hutama is?,4,104,وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْحُطَمَةُ,O Messenger! What do you know of this fire that smashes everything that is thrown into it?
It is the fire kindled by God,5,104,نَارُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُوقَدَةُ,"Indeed, it is the blazing fire of Allah."
Which penetrates the hearts,6,104,ٱلَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى ٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةِ,The fire that penetrates the bodies of the people until it reaches their hearts.
(And) vaults them over,7,104,إِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ,"Indeed, it will close up around those that will be punished with it."
In extending columns.,8,104,فِى عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةٍۭ,"For a prolonged, lengthy period of time, so long that they will never leave it."
HAVE YOU NOT seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants?,0,105,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَٰبِ ٱلْفِيلِ,"O Messenger! Do you not know how your Lord dealt with Abraha and his people: the people of the elephant, when they intended to demolish the Ka‘bah?"

"(While) you were pelting them with stones of porphyritic lava,",3,105,تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ,They pelted them with stones of clay.
And turned them into pastured fields of corn?,4,105,فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍۭ,So Allah made them like the leaves of crops that have been eaten and trampled upon by livestock.

"But who are oblivious of their moral duties,",4,107,ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ,Those who are heedless of their prayer; they do not care about it such that its time expires.
Who dissimulate,5,107,ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَآءُونَ,"Those who show off by their prayer and good deeds, not being sincere in doing deeds for Allah."
And withhold things of common use (from others).,6,107,وَيَمْنَعُونَ ٱلْمَاعُونَ,And they refrain from helping others with things in which there is no difficulty helping in.
HAVE SURELY given you pre-eminence (in numbers and following);,0,108,بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ,"O Messenger! Indeed, I have granted you abundant goodness, from which is the river of Kawthar in Paradise."
So serve your Lord with full dedication and sacrifice.,1,108,فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ,"So be grateful to Allah for this blessing, by performing prayer for Him alone and offering sacrifice for Him, as opposed to the offerings of sacrifice the idolaters do for their idols."
It is surely your opponents whose line will come to end.,2,108,إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ,"Indeed, your hater is cut off from every goodness, and will be forgotten. If remembered, he will be remembered negatively."

Then glorify your Lord and seek His forgiveness. Verily He is relenting.,2,110,فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ تَوَّابًۢا,"Then know that is a sign of the nearing of the end of your duty you were sent to fulfil. So glorify your Lord together with praising Him, to show gratitude to Him for the favours of help and victory, and seek His forgiveness, because indeed, He is the Forgiving, who accepts the repentance of His servants and forgives them."
